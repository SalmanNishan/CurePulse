mark i've received your ticket that you're not able to enforce medications i just wanted to have a look at it yeah it's so it's such a pain in the ass i wish i'm trying to import numbers it doesn't populate and it's a it's it's a flood system well no worries i would make sure that this this becomes easy for you do you have any desk on your computer uh maybe i can see yeah i do perfect i'm ready for the number whenever you're ready i'm loading up 157 335 635 okay i'm sending you a request to accept okay okay i can see your screen could could you please elevate this request from the green button perfect could you please take me to the application let's go to this guy for example um uh mark could you please uh enlarge this a little the screen great thank you okay let me tell you what i've been doing you tell me where i'm going wrong okay okay no problem and by the way is the response time has been so sluggish with cure my nerves by phone office woman and my and my nurse are frustrated because they click on something nothing happens so i want to go to the guy thinks he's on okay we we have everyone uh signed the informed consent that we put in their chart for this okay now this guy how can you say this guy has no active coverage he's got insurance uh from two companies medicare and blue cross how do why would this be rejected to say you have no active coverage for insurance uh well uh mark in this case i mean when it comes to insurance the the application would would have a live check on it so uh i would take a note of it what what actually i'm planning at is to to record your concerns and then get back to you the first thing that's what you're saying is that the medicare insurance is is not wait wait wait wait wait before you get off distracted this is this is not the main problem this is a common associated problem is we we click on that says the guy doesn't have insurance that's not true he's got insurance okay so that's one problem another page so how do you how do i get so here i'm trying to get i'm trying to get his rx history it says you saw that you saw the error please take a screenshot of this because this frustrates us all the time and it says your patient doesn't have insurance when we have its insurance and we and we go back and we find these eligible for that stuff right look how long this takes to click i mean i've got a super high speed computer and this is insanely slow cure md is the slowest program on my computer why is that well uh what we'll do is we'll take care of that it guy have a look at your computer to make sure that you if you're facing this it's not my computer it's my computer my nurses computer at my front desk they they say they click something and you get this shit for five minutes well what is that this should not be this way so this is not normal this is not normal so why are we experiencing at that well that needs to be taken care of and i'll make sure that that happens within today so you you're experiencing slowness in system that would be really nice guys let's check this guy out let's see if we can get his medication screwed up okay so here's another guy alright let me click on this history okay blah blah blah okay so if i want to import the list of stuff that's in his that has been filled right i clicked that now see the delay here like we put something i have to wait every time i've taken a note of it okay so if i want to click all the verified prescriptions a lot of patients don't know their dose okay so if i if i click if i wanna get rid of all the ones that he says he's on it doesn't remember i recruit this and then just continue them all is that accurate is that a question yes that's a question if if the patient the patient has a memory problem he doesn't know what drugs that so if i want to just list the drugs that have actually been filled which are these are verified we filled with doses to get rid of all the ones he thinks he might be on it doesn't remember if he's taken i wanted to clear the slate so discontinue all the ones we had in the history well you can do that if if uh the patient is no more on any one of these medications you can discontinue the medication i told you he doesn't remember what he's taking and these are the ones that have been filled he's not sure if he's taken any of these so would it not since there's a redundancy and there may be a difference in doses that is more accurate on the right side should i not get rid of all the the old ones that we had mhm well well let me let me just take this down as well and i'll be getting back to you on this so what you're saying is that the patient does not remember the exact medication that is taking right now most most patients don't know what the fuck they're taking okay they don't know the name of the drug because they're just pills the other doctors all the time so they don't know what they're taking so to clear the updates and get the most accurate information of things that have actually filled these are filled prescriptions would you agree i do so i'm gonna get rid of that just to see what happens but so so i'm gonna discontinue all of the complete these are all so that's done so if i want to bring in all the ones that are have recorded prescriptions i should accept that correct mhm and these are redundant so i'm gonna replace those right so when i do that what do i do now sign it or do i click current because i don't know what to do next it doesn't say what to do next because if i click sign sometimes it just disappears and nothing changed what what is it how can you guys never gave us the steps on how to do this well um okay just give me one quick moment let me have someone have a look at this give me one moment mark and this is now that this is the primary concern that we're having for now right then it says what is this bullshit history has already been imported it cannot be imported in the 21st what does that mean and why not could you could you show me the message one more time i'm sorry let me import that whoever designed this i gotta tell you i'm not impressed let's go back another week pick another random person here i want to check this guy's medications check his his uh his history he's signing consent i'm gonna continue so i'm gonna find out so i'm gonna import all the drugs of prescriptions that have been filled i'm gonna because he doesn't know doses i'm gonna i'm gonna remove these that are the other the other effective doesn't remember okay so that's gone they're gone then i wanna bring in his prescription history i would accept them okay so what do i do now do i press fine do i press what what's next well uh mark i absolutely understand uh the concerns that you're having a couple of them the the notes left taken down what i believe is you just need a quick uh training session on the work flows of this part right that's the only concern right but you guys you guys don't even you guys don't give instructions here you guys let the workflow in your software doesn't doesn't even leave let a person know what the next step is it just gives you we have four boxes you know and if i click the wrong box the whole thing shut down then it says you can't do this for another 24 hours if you click the wrong box what is your 24 why do you have who put that in there well well i have i'll have a look at it um again as i said mark you don't need to worry about this what we're gonna do is that we would be we would be uh just just give me one quick moment can i can i put you on a brief hold yeah sure okay let me look at all the drugs he has no idea taking any of these okay no problem mark okay go ahead put me on hold just give me one quick moment i'll be right back with you thank you for holding mark okay uh what what i'm gonna do is that i'm gonna look you you're having one problem with the insurance when it's when uh active it says that the insurance is not active the other problem that you're having is the slowness on computers then with this medication workflow right so for the slowest thing i'll make sure that someone from the it gets back to you and for these workflows you you would be uh we can schedule uh what do you call that a training session that could comprise of 10 to 15 minutes where this medications portion uh could could be discussed in detail alright so could you please guide me mark what is the best time for you to to get into that training session if if you schedule it today well the best time would be about 8:30 pacific time like maybe uh wednesday morning perhaps monday morning on monday alright 8:30 in the morning pacific time either monday on priority if not on monday that could be wednesday then right right right right right uh one moment alright mark um what i'm gonna do is that i would confirm uh the training time with you uh right after lunch so i will be calling you around um three o'clock today right or 3 15 and i'll be confirming you the time for the training on monday or if it's not possible on monday we could do it on wednesday 8 30 in the morning pacific time look at what's the time there right now now right now it's 8 51 it's 8:51 yeah okay so we have uh almost a 3 hours difference that one more time we're in california i think you guys are in new york correct thats correct right right so so it's gonna be 12 hour time uh no it's gonna be 30 over time uh mark i'm gonna give you a call back right after lunch i mean after lunch 3 15 today uh it's gonna be my time right so it's gonna be 12 15 your time today today i'll just give you a call back or what we can put it this way that i can update it on the ticket alright i'll put a comment on the ticket confirming the time of the training okay this is yourself yeah 3107737035 yeah alright sure i'll be giving you a mark mark i'll be giving you a call in like around three hours and 15 minutes to confirm you uh the training time for monday alright great and i hope that what about speeding up the uh speeding up the uh the the let me sure this guy is on about 10 different drugs and did you see what i do i try to update it and it removed drugs somewhere well this this is gonna be taken care of once once we we go in the training session all these questions are gonna be addressed don't worry is that all these drugs right and then when he didn't know that i prescribed isn't even on there anymore makes sense so what's what's going on here don't worry about it i mean this is i mean one thing a mark is that right after the training session this these workflows are gonna be convenient so it's it's it's actually that we we are not doing it the way we should do it and that's the only thing that's lacking is the training so that's that's gonna be taken care of about the slowness thing i would request you to please log a separate ticket for slowness and uh give it a title that says uh slowness on all computers all practice computers and then you can put the details in the description you want to and uh give it a major priority and someone will be getting back to you on this from i t department alright mark alright so i'm gonna give you a call back uh at 12:15 your time today to confirm okay okay all right thank you thanks mark you're welcome byebye"}}, {"id": 2, "data": {"call_id":

what was your name please once again kathy k a t h y alright i'm going to transfer your call to phil becker alright mhm mhm um-hum uh thank you for staying on the line kathy how are you good how are you i'm good thank you so i just want to clarify this so i've already sent into forms and so why is this different from the electronic fund transfer authorization or the electronic funds transfer authorization form is the form that's the same one i'm sorry um the second one i did was they submitted form provider electronic submitted form why is this different from that uh because these applications are for the edi claim submissions through the curemd d and uh you will receive the e r a in the system uh this particular application is for the edi and era enrollment which is separate from the eft enrollment and for the submiter uh authorization okay alright it's just frustrating because if i knew i needed this other form i would have had it done at the time i did the other form it comes through these forms comes through the clearing house what do you mean they come through the clearinghouse like uh you're using yes you're using our accounts to submit the claims and you'll be receiving the eras through our clearing house so these forms are usually you know sent by the clearing house okay but he's got to get this notarized now too yes uh just a second okay and so i still can't i still can't submit claims yet then no okay but uh it's a sign in two spots the one on page two and then the notary page uh you just like i haven't checked the forms yet but uh wherever the signature signature required every place should be signed and also the notarized one as well so so once you send it might take a couple of days because now he's not in the office and then we have to get a notary so okay uh once you send the forms you can reply me in the email with the tracking number so that uh our enrollment team can follow up with the insurance okay alright thank you no problem you can reply me in the email and my extension is 537 yes i got that yep okay alright thank you okay no problem thank you so much for your time bye bye"}}, {"id": 6, "data": {"call_id": "1622565885.1208816.txt", "text": "hello hello Dr Mashada yes uh give me one second here okay can you stay on the line just one second i'll talk to you okay sure thank you bye bye okay so we can get him a risk race let me answer this call and uh but just six weeks to come back okay hello hey joshua hi uh so sorry mr come back time i got talking to call uh no problem at all okay so uh regarding we wanted to follow up yeah just wanted to follow up with the kiosk and all of that so what do you what do you what have you come up with so so far um yeah like i said i discussed uh your suggestion with a bunch of my colleagues and uh yeah they look positive they do like the idea but it's all about how we present it to our change control board so that's what i'm coming up with right now so let's see uh what would be the people who would need help uh or who would be the ones affected by the provider yeah office provided mainly us provider uh so mainly the providers okay would expedite our ability to first of all patient will stay less time sitting down on the hallway doing paperwork you know so expedite that so less exposure to you know social distancing okay i know we're getting better with those but that's why number two it's uh it decrease the amount of time for scanning all those documents you know that's a waste of paper and time okay so you're wasting you know saving equal equally friends okay and it's much more efficient for us so it says time efficient you know uh and it's more accurate you know we don't have to be gassing the patient's notes you know when they write it you don't understand them you know it's more accurate because it's gonna be electronic mhm understood now this would include uh information that is you know mainly provided by the patients such as their social history or basically any kind of history and uh other than that it could also include like past medications or allergies as well right yes correct because i so let me give an experience last week i went to a primary care i went to a doctor and in the paper work their way they collect your data you know the bullets that you mark like multiple choice of bullets and they scan that goes to the charge that's the way to use it and it's all there they asked okay do you have diabetes you have this you have that do that you just mark it boom have you had this surgery you just marked bullet points you know and then scan it i was like like when you do a test you know and then for some reason that goes to their electric correct so that's what i don't want that bullets you know but i want the electronics that you give the options you know you have any medical history then you have the most common over there you know and if there's nothing there they can type it you know do you you know have you had surgeries and then same thing for the portal will be the exact same thing so because yeah the the part that they do they're probably taking in the images directly into social history i guess the scan documents they're putting in them as history but therefore on our end goal it goes into the clinical clinical review of the patient okay so click on on the patient that's what i wanted i wanted to stay i don't want this to be a custom form you know image you want to be officially part of the history yes exactly because if it is an image it's worthless because next time they come in i have to put it on you know so it's not gonna and of course i have i have documents for consent that you guys already have those right that that's already there correct so that's already there okay so let's break this down into two words that they would want so okay the problem the clinicians are currently facing with the work let's go with that so okay we have no way in which clinical information can be obtained from patients during registration and you just say patients are not utilizing the portal to enter their information our compliance is less than 10% and we want to find a way to have those done electronically and what's happening there sitting down and doing paperwork and with the covid you know we want to find a way to do a little more efficient mhm yeah because yeah compliance less than 10% that's a huge factor obviously you usually i think it would be the reason being would be the patient portal is less user friendly right i don't know i don't know we do a lot of medicare you know so that's that's the tough part you know so it's i don't know i don't wanna say that okay i just say that unfortunately is not very compliant that's that's the main deal you know because the patient portal of course it could be you know due to the fact people just don't wanna go on there that could be one of the things the other could be it's unfriendly because of course uh we would need feedback on that to make that better of course the patient portal itself but okay that's another thing let's just focus on kiosk for now because that's the main focus so that we maintain information the patient patients are not utilizing the portal to enter in this information yes okay other than that yeah that's i think that's good enough for the problem same in the main problem um other than that what would the future what would be beneficial after applying the feature uh let's see less less less you know social keeping social distancing okay so avoiding uh how do we say extra time scanning documents you know and avoid errors and also avoid errors because you're not having to read their writings you know so more patient safety for that as well okay finish the emails from me to three okay uh one second and then uh just finish it starts at one okay and then mark the guys either approximately versus uh yeah but just check it out one second josh again okay sean make sure it's fine and then i'll see you guys over there okay josh we'll keep talking to you right now no problem so it will benefit you know so less time scanning documents so equally friend friendly uh prevent more errors you know because uh it's done electronically it's more efficient okay okay canonical e friendly and less paperwork uh save time avoid errors less exposure to covid okay other than that yeah that's good and also also josh you can say also we're moving forward you know you know when we do this it's like instead of being stuck with the paperwork we're just moving more electronically it makes the kiosk more powerful you know more desirable to to have because right now i have no desire to use that you know because this is what i wanted because my staff they my staff they do the check in for my patients so you know i don't need the kiosk i will use it if you had those functions you know so improves usability of the application itself makes sense definitely it becomes an application more more likable might use the user experience is much better you know so uh the registration part of course would help with it because uh yeah i understand you know uh the less paperwork people have obviously in the better it is makes sense alright and i appreciate you taking the time with me man i really appreciate that you know this is we were with you guys you know and you know try to get you guys better and this helps everybody you know that's kind of my goal here you know the only part we lack in as you know the amount of time these requests take of course we do try to you know get them in as soon as possible that's okay i'm fine as long as you guys i would like to know if you're gonna be accepted or not that's what i'd like to know if you can work on it said hey this doctor shaw you know i think it's gonna work out you're gonna do it you know it might take six months that's fine i don't mind i'll wait you know i'll wait and when the time comes we start using the kiosk you know so definitely of course i will obviously update you you know as soon as you know the whole uh gets accepted of course i will update you uh you know immediately after that i'm just gonna put it in today and uh you know just hope for the best after that i'll uh just let you know let me ask you this you may not know that they kind of let's say because it's already set on the website is it very hard to create the code for for an app is that more complex or of course have to develop the user experience and all of that but the data templates you know uh diabetes you know those you guys should have that already correct like for for diagnosis you know for diagnosis a template for diagnosis you know what i mean like when you when you go to the portal you write your stuff even on our website you say past medical is you guys already have several disease over there yeah i just picked them you know i just i beat his thyroid you know boom boom boom boom you know they already there you know they don't have to be creating those well anyways man i'm excited hopefully this uh you can kinda kinda convince them it's gonna be up on you man make it happen yeah i'm gonna do my best here because yeah i'm gonna be talking with the main developer here because hopefully he likes my idea as well because of course it's not just one person working on it it's just a combination of teams so yeah of course that's just what's gonna come into play as long as it's approved i don't know if you have this ability to get a data to say you know how to know percentage of people are using the portal i can tell from my office it's just it's you know very little so if you have more people you know you can you know say hey you know i checked it as well i don't know if you have a possibility you know it'd be another another tool to get a to get them to to to to get to our our our petition yeah you could actually probably i don't know if you could but i think we could probably run a report to see at least you know the number of log ins we had on the portal at least for a specific excited yeah that would you know help you out of course that would be something i could actually put forward to see if that's something that i don't know if there's something of course that you know hopefully we can see the frequency of log into the patient portal on the last year for your practice yeah that could actually so last year last year i saw 3600 patients in my office last year a little bit a lot of patients you know in my clinic so of course a lot of them are return you know a lot of them post office but when they come for the first time we need to do the entire paperwork this is just me my partner saw 3500 patients the other one you know 2000 to 3000 so just just us without counting the p a s without county the physical therapist dude we are seeing you know 15,000 patients a year okay so just think about that you know the amount of money we save time paper you know scanning you know all of that just multiply that yeah if you know if people could actually registered on the portal i think that would actually prevent any paperwork at all if everyone you know where was registering you were accepting the invites but i think the problem is every single yeah they don't do we we talked to every single patient of us this will send you an email we send you a link please go to the portal and fill in your past medical is just they just don't do it yeah i think the i think the only part that i could actually tell them is just let us know how many patients for added versus how many actually register for the portal if you could get a report like that that would paint a more accurate picture i guess how do i get a report like i have no idea i have no clue yeah i don't think it's i don't think it's available on the front either i think i might request her back you might be able to pay for it but uh yeah i'd have to request it let me see if i can get it but uh yeah if i have something i will forward it to you too but if you don't mind you know i saw 3600 my part of 3500 the other one like almost 3000 it's you know 10,000 patients plus the p t s you know so we we see easily you know 15,000 patients a year anyways well thanks man so you have some information to bargain with them over there yeah i just wanted to make sure you know i got like proper clinical reasons and of course it does help to you know brainstorm with someone who already has the idea in his head so yeah of course is you know much more helpful talking to you about it thank you man i appreciate you calling me back and uh not giving up on me there we'll keep in touch then okay you can call me at any time okay all right thank you need to contact me again okay take care then thanks for follow up"}}, {"id": 7, "data": {"call_id": "1621951232.1046245.txt", "text": "good morning this is jeff calling from curemd can i speak with robert he's not in at the

clinic how may i help you hi amber this is jeff calling from curemd how are you doing i'm good how are you i'm fine this is regarding the ticket that was logged last week about doctor house about the rx errors we spoke about on friday about it yes got you do you have time right now so i could go over you with what went wrong with those medications yeah that'd be great all right so i spoke with the technical team and they were able to look into this at the back end as well and to confirm that for both of these that failed for directions uh and by that i mean customs sick there were spaces and by that i mean extra spaces in the sick that they were entering so for instance there was this one medication that the provider actually prescribe and it says three tablets for three days two tablets for two days and one tablet for one day and that was the medication for eight days alright and when the provider was going ahead and entering this they were actually extra spaces in between these so i'm just assuming here that when the provider puts in three tablets for two days she presses an enter to take the text to the next line and put two tablets for two days one tablet for four days and then again she puts an enter and that's what caused all of these prescriptions to fail and this has been double checked at our end and the back end as well okay so there was a space before extra space no not before during the extra spaces when she's entering the sick got you if the provider could actually only hit space once when she's typing in and to take this you know if she's taking a longer statement a longer sick or instruction to the next line she should not press enter she should rather hit space only once the system would automatically take her to the next line got you alright and i just wanted to confirm for the failed prescriptions has she gone ahead and re prescribe those to the patients yeah i went ahead and called him in all right all right is there anything else i can help you with i don't think so alright and we're good on this prescription right yeah we're good alright so she um let me say that again she should only hit space once and should not hit enter when she's going to a next line because the system would automatically take in the spaces gotcha alright thank you amber for your time alrighty thank you can i go ahead and close the support ticket yeah that's perfect alright good day bye thank you you too"}}, {"id": 9, "data": {"call_id": "1622657351.1251915.txt", "text": "uh huh uh project this is ryan again from CureMD support uh regarding the uh user

with cure m d how are you doing hi i'm good how are you i'm good as well i was calling in regarding the uh reported concern regarding novel health yeah a lot of our patients aren't getting the link i'm not sure if we're doing something wrong or there's something in the system and uh what are the reporting that they're getting or are they not getting anything at all they're not getting anything like almost all of the patients for today called and said i never got a link is it still virtual and so i just reset everybody's this morning um because then another person called about an appointment for thursday uh okay let's see because right now i tested it out on my side just to you know see if uh you know we're getting the same concern on our end or there's anything but i can't seem to reproduce the you know concern on my end because i got uh the link automatically when i scheduled an appointment so uh for the patients uh let's see so are you going in and clicking like hold on um look at another uh are you clicking save or save and send sms only safe should be fine that's what we're doing we used to send both and then we were told no just to send the save and so that's what we're doing and i think some of them are getting them but others even like the call and say i don't get it and so i read you the appointment and click save and they don't get it and i have to go into the novel health where the link is and send it that way is the only way they're getting it mhm yeah this one way to send it of course other than that other than that uh let's see hitting safe i think let me just double check for you because we did change one of our work close for resetting appointments so i just wanna be sure when i'm making the same mistake again okay so this happened only for today correct no it's been happening for yeah yeah i mean it was where it was definitely worse today which i put the the ticket in but the last week or so we have people that keep calling and saying i never got a link and so we didn't think much of it because a lot of times people just you know the delete them and so we've been re sending them but today almost all we got like five calls right around this morning about the appointments and we kept getting them like i said and so i just went into novel health and i resent everybody's for today but i just got another phone call about someone's appointment on either wednesday or thursday that also didn't get a link mhm because uh i would suggest the best way would be you know to resend them would be going on to the dashboard instead of just clicking save on the appointments you could just go there and resend them from the novel health dashboard that would be the short fire away because we changed our workflows because every time you made a change like for example added a comment on uh and hit save on the appointment it will resend the link so that was something that was inconveniencing a lot of people so we decided to no longer you know send the text or the email link again and you just hit save for the appointment so after that the only way to resend would be through the novel health dashboard or through uh cancelling the appointment and scheduling it again okay so the appointment is already scheduled we can't just click save and send the appointment unless the time is something that has changed for you know the appointment itself if that is something that's changed then rescheduled yeah that then the appointment uh then the link would go out again but just hitting save to resend the link okay good to know okay if you could just uh try resending them through the dashboard because currently i really can't reproduce it on my side i can try with you right now if you could just uh give me your email address so we can uh check if you're getting the issue right now well like if i go on to the novel health dashboard i know that that works so we'll just keep doing that i guess not that one when i was just scheduling an appointment you know with your email listed in the test station alright i've already got a test in there that has my email which patient i think it's my name me look rebecca text i think that's the one rebecca garden okay got it so i should get a text message let me just schedule the appointment one second okay it should be getting one shortly hold on one second yeah user already exists with this email uh okay we can do it with your email i guess we'll just do it uh with yeah your mobile number could you just provide your mobile number yeah 7,178,381,090 okay email address needs to be changed okay the appointment is now scheduled let me know if you get a text um i did yep you got it okay so yeah that's working umm well if you occur this um you know in more frequency i'll just keep the ticket open uh for the day i can just call you um what do you think uh near the end of the day like three or when you guys in six today um okay i'll leave at 5 30 i'll uh call you guys around uh say 3 to 4 to you know check if uh you know how your appointments went throughout the day if you know there's still a frequency of people who are reporting it i'll just uh log in the case to uh our back end team and uh yeah we'll see if there's anything you know missing on our side okay sounds good alright well you have a good day alright"}}, {"id": 18, "data": {"call_id": "1622832371.1311383.txt", "text": "cherry hail extension 1049 hi sherry this is ben fisher calling from cure md how are you doing today hey good how about you i'm good thank you so much i uh was investigating yesterday and the day before yesterday about the concern reported by that in the logs the name of the other user was not appearing there so i could not find any of the user which could have the access to the doctor's note however if if the doctor says that it was for that particular patient so i really am not sure why is it not appearing it or if if maybe the doctor say is mistaken for the name of the patient because i found out that there were a lot of patients actually who uh doctor was working on and in the mean time there was another user who access to note the doctor access the note again so could be kind of well let me tell you ben i think so uh with this this particular provider she she works from home so it's not a situation where you know an uh an m a or somebody like that would be you know bringing the patient back and doing you know like their vitals and stuff and so what we kind of think happened after i was talking to um because she's kind of like an office manager there um i was explaining to her that thing that you showed me under the users and i told her you know if that's on then this the practice setting it really kind of doesn't matter because it'll be overridden anyways and she was like okay that makes sense but uh when we were talking about how much she was in and out of that note viewing inserting and all that what we think happened is is that she is going in and out of the note possibly opening up a new window so she can look at an old note and she's forgetting where she's at and she's just going back into it in another one we think she's doing it to herself we think is happening um so what we decided to do is i told i told her that um about how to jump to a prior notes so she can view it without leaving the screen because she didn't know about that and so we talked about try that and see if that works and rather than opening multiple windows or if she's going in and out of the note opening it and reopening it just so she can view an old note so we think this will probably clear up her problem because none of the other providers seem to be having this issue so that's why we don't think that it was somebody else it was her she's probably somehow doing it on her own by opening up the notes probably in in two windows is what she's doing there is a possibility i saw a provider that uh what she went boston she was opening up multiple windows each time she would be on a providers notes she will leave it there and then she would log into another window into cure md and i told her why would you do that i mean you can go to another provider note right from the same window so i told her that but probably she could be uh maybe that is the reason because if she's leaving the provide a note there it means that she's working on it and no other user is working on it so that could be a possibility when we were looking though one thing that did come up and you may wanna check into this is that when we were looking at that um that report the audit log um you know where it has like uh shows that she was in it and all of that and there's a little plus button to the left of each of those instances so we could see what was it but when you click on it it quickly flashes the screen and then all of a sudden there's lines around all of those and it won't open like you can't see when you click the plus button what was she doing or did she change anything or update something because you know on some of them it'll say updated or insert or view and there's the plus button all the way to the left of each of those instances but when we click the plus button it won't let us look at it okay i get it what you're saying i've seen such a thing before this as well i'm gonna just take a look at that once again and i'm gonna see why because i know if you click on it it just shows you what what's the detail it just goes away it's like it's so fast you couldn't even read it i mean and then it then all of a sudden there's lines on all of those things and you know it's uh it's like what happened here i get it what you're saying i know i've seen this before as well if i'm gonna take a look into this morning again and if there is something of that sort of happening here as well so we're gonna take a look and we're gonna escalate this one too alright that sounds good but i i think that she probably did do it to herself but we can figure out why we can't see those things you know um i think that it'll be okay if we can just get that part fixed yes of course alright so i'm gonna leave the ticket open until we we get that voice and i look into that"}}, {"id": 19, "data": {"call_id": "1620324505.753941.txt", "text": "thank you for calling cure md this is bryce how can i help you hey bryce this

access okay alright so now i deleted the 55 because like i said i thought maybe i entered it wrong and it was just a 55 payment but um i got to thinking about that i was like no i i remember typing in because i gave the patient a receipt so i had a patient bring the receipt back and it was 3 49 $349 payment that she made do you remember the service on for which you took the payment for it was i took the payment on on february the 12th and the date of service it went on $294 went on 10 8 20 and then the $55 went on 10 15 20 okay uh well how much is the total amount 49 correct right that's correct okay and uh $49 went to know 10 15 20 okay okay and then $294 went to 10 8 20 now when i printed my patient payment report that i do to do my deposit the $55 showed up on my um print out but the 294 did not so my um my deposit was not adding up so i went back to look at uh the date and um i deleted the 55 was looking for because i'm thinking that that's the only thing that posted but then when i got the receipt it everything posted but it's not showing up it wouldn't show up on my um patient payment report okay let me check see where it's saying that the $294 on 10 8 20 that that was not showing up on my report nor wasn't showing up in the ledger where you can see it and the payment was the pay date was um february the 12th and it should be i'm sure it was somewhere in there because when she came and paid that 3 49 that is what the patient balance was showing at the top and that's why she paid that amount and now it's showing under applied $68 and patient was not 1 91 but it's showing 1 91 now because i had deleted for 55 so before that was showing let me check give me a moment last name is thomas now as you're telling me that there was a payment of 2 right okay now

so we are going to this patients oh i can preview this off all right so if i am okay so this is the claim how it's printing okay you'll see the here lying item 17 a it's merged with 17 b all i need is

are you there hey hi pete how you doing im fine um yeah uh so i don't know if this is like i don't think this is necessarily even related um can we screen share because i have a claim i'm trying to load and um i'm doing it the same way i do all the other ones with the location the rendering in the billing but um no tax id or social nothing showing up at all okay i'm ready for the anydesk please give me the number okay yep sure it's gonna be 716933 682 got you sending a request please accept great i can see your screen yes okay so i'll just show you so the charge i did today just to make sure and it seems like it's just maybe affiliated with this particular insurance plan that this other patient has i'll show you the charge i did today so to compare it so mhm so you'll see here location irene ryan rendering ryan irene capital our capital i billing capital our capital i and i'll just show you what the claim looks like so down here you see her tax id see atlantic city atlantic city this is what it's supposed to look like so if i go into this other patient and additionally she wasn't on my day sheet and i was trying to figure out there must be some reason you know connected to this whole problem with her right here is this patient for the charge i did the other day and actually i had to correct it because originally i did it wrong because i i did location i did that because she has the philly office and i did it so it didn't match so anyway i went in here to correct it so you can see it's the same as the other one location irene ryan rendering irene ryan billing irene ryan so when i go to look at it there's nothing here let me actually you know i understand that what you're talking about actually uh let me actually show you something if you go to your profiles of the practice providers you have like three profiles right now and after discussing with the development team what we actually advised we advise to actually use this one now i completely agree with you these two profiles does have the um ein number which is the tax id i can actually show you that uh over here as well so i actually get there now the thing is um in order to actually get that populated on the file so we can actually look into this like maybe the information is something is not missing over there but that's related to philadelphia though that's why i don't use that one i know that one's for philly and that's the one we we used to do that see how it's affiliated with the social but she wasn't seen in pennsylvania she was seen in new jersey and i can't have mismatch that one's for philadelphia as well those and that one's for the philadelphia tax id so there's one philly tax id there's one philly social and then there's one atlantic city tax id only and that's always how it's been and there's never been a problem so i don't know why all of a sudden things had to be reorganized on your end i understand that just give me one quick moment it does have two information right now and ein assistant number is there as well so uh can you go back to the charge for showing me um the we say service for this month for blake additionally i noticed that um her charge is for a mirror health administrator if you go into settings and you look up the plans it looks like that plan is inactive i don't know if that's like part of it or if i'm looking at the wrong you know wrong thing or whatever so here's how are these these all these things down here indicate atlantic city atlantic city atlantic city and it should populate the tax id hm give me one quick moment let me see on my end so for this specific patient you need the combination of the tax id and the npi the npi right um i just need you know like i showed you on that last person i just need to say atlantic city atlantic city with the i mean i guess i don't know i never really paid attention to the npi i just always look at the tax id or the social okay uh can you show me the previous patient just go to the his charge page and uh that makes you check on my end if you have the right details over here okay yep so here's set up the same way we can look at it now go to the um please yeah yeah now for atlantic city this is what it's supposed to look like this is what it's always looked like atlantic city atlantic city tax id got you give me one quick moment and which was the template you're using right now um sorry what do you mean template uh the template yes if you go back to the generate claim section on the top just click on the claims and uh this is it the one you're using right now uh yeah i mean uh i don't know i just print it i don't know no problem no problem just give me one moment i'm not i don't know what you mean it doesn't matter i put it on printed on a plane blank piece of paper because the thing is this number is missing right now and disclosure as well other than that you have the address correct dr irene 25 in yeah all that's correct but just the tax id is missing in the individuals claim but like i said if you go to her plan i mean i know you know better than i do but if you go to her plan she's a um her insurance ah here's her insurance she's a mayor health admin right yes if you go to the settings and you go to uh what is it billing plans if you go to a mayor health admin let me find out on my end i'm wrong i'm wrong that's not related i was looking at the one below it says mayor health casualty that's the one that i said no that's not active alright so it's back to your problem now i don't know what it is give me one quick moment let me see npi and uh we're talking about 25 right 25 bucks yes which actually come up with the tax id or the s s n number depending upon the profile ah the capital i capital r you know the way her name is that's that's indicative of atlantic city only which associates a tax id just give me one moment the other two the other two are both for philly one indicates tax id and that third one indicates social that's why they're done in capital that's why ones in lower case that's why they're all different you know what i mean they're all for different purposes i understand that let me see i'm just looking at the previous digits to resolve the same patient for liam and let's see if we have the same information there or not did you have the number there and uh yeah but it's not showing over here one second sure take your time please you're not my hold on okay i'm sorry about that by myself today all right so what are you thinking hello yes im here just give me one moment yesh yeah let me have a look this one i can't even look at how do you look at it just as workers comp i hate that when you can't look at the claim anymore i'm sorry the worker's complaint uh yes because the thing is uh if you go down in the bottom you will see like there's no responsible plans selected this is why it's just saying you workers comp so you need to respect the responsible plan the next responsible over here so you will be able to see the claim section and the professional section over there i want it why does it keep doing that still here we go this never got uploaded i'm gonna actually change the uh billing provider to capital because um i don't want any changes i just wanted to work the way it always works can i ask you uh the reason of having suite and like having three different profiles of the doctor yeah that's what i that's what i was explaining to you okay so the capital i capital r is for atlantic city only and it is associated with the atlantic city address rendering atlantic city provider billing associate with tax id only little irene ryan is for philadelphia only and is associated with her social security number only because some providers want her social she has to bill with then she has another profile all capital that is also philadelphia cap billing rendering all philadelphia but that's associated with her tax id only so there's she has to have the three perfect i got you okay so please give me some time krista i have to work with the development team because they were working on this yesterday and uh i will uh get back to you on this because in case if you just want to have the tax id over there so we need to make sure it should appear over there as well because from uh the first profile we were facing this issue that whenever it's attached with the rendering and billing provider you will no longer be able to create the edi file but you were able to do that in the past so just give me some time i will work on this and will get back to you with an update okay um okay i just hope all my charges i uploaded that day were right scared now i completely agree i understand that uh just give me like one or two hours i will get back to you on this okay let me work on this alright great no problem alright talk to you later you too bye bye"}}, {"id": 31, "data": {"call_id": "1623075236.13369.txt", "text": "hello hi good morning this is brent from curemd is this elena it is hi how are you i'm doing well how are you i'm doing good i just wanted to know did you get my message on the ticket that i entered i did um i'm not at all familiar with the billing aspect and i need to know i'm sure as you know we have a new billing department that we're gonna be using and they had questions about how to access the clearing house um and is there a separate log in or is it just basically it's there like you said in your um it's actually embedded in the application so i can show that to you if you're willing to share your screen or i can share mine um sure i'll share my screen let me here mhm okay so i haven't anydesk number if you'd like it go ahead it's 706 135996 okay so a few things um just to minimize this and uh i'm guessing you guys use super bill for submission so let me just check one thing okay so a few things uh you wanna make sure that everyone is billing everything out on a daily basis weekly whatever the case might be uh so if you're in the billing section and go to super bill anything that is signed so this is actually the uh provider note status and this is the super bill status anything that is signed and signed should be uh billed out and ready to go like you just need to create a charge and you can submit the account is as simple as clicking on the date of service and then this is where the billers would come in they can change any information further on the charge page after reviewing the provider notes and uh once they save the charge it ends up in your clean bucket so uh one thing is that you can review the e super bill to ensure that they're doing that on a daily basis there shouldn't be anything older so this is worth 28 pages not sure how far back this goes so this is one thing you can keep an eye on uh to make sure that all the claims are going out so once the claims have been created uh they will end up in your clean bucket uh they normally end up here uh their limited to last 60 days or anything that is older will not appear in here so there's four at the moment i'm guessing there's one that is older than uh 60 days this is a balancing issue so this cannot be submitted this needs to be uh corrected first uh either the claim doesn't need to go to south carolina or the payment is posted incorrectly okay okay so as long as this bucket is not filled with claims that are not going out and this bucket is not filled with claims that are just stuck here uh incomplete claims are basically anything that is missing something so let's say if you're missing an address or a policy number very minor stuff uh you probably won't see many claims in here just make sure you don't okay so onto the clearing house stuff um the cleaning stuff is actually embedded in the application so if we talk about claims that are not being processed we can look at rejected so these are the two claims that are that have not gone through the entire process the reason for the rejections is listed here you'll have to click on this arrow it gives you a reason if the reason does not make sense you can dig into this uh dat of service it's a matter of clicking on dat of service also i'd like to point out that anywhere in the application especially in the claims module or the financial overview in the billing over there is the denials bucket we'll see there in a moment if you click on the dat of service it takes us into the appointment we can bypass this information just click on the hyperlink and it will expand the options on the left so you can actually see the real rejection reason even though we can see it on the front end but if you want to look at the actual reason you'll have to look at the third file this is what comes from the clearing house this is actually the main response of the rejection as can be seen here policy canceled insured subscribers so either the policy number needs to be updated or uh you'll have to check the eligibility to verify this further okay okay so just make sure that rejections are being worked on on a daily basis there's not too much on here um because anything that is received here is not that has not gone through the entire process so you can face problems with timely filing did accident let's save an event to this bucket let me i'm going to put this one on hold because it's not corrected sorry about that you are fine so once the rejections have been corrected you'll have to move them to the corrected bucket and then you can resubmit the claims and anything that gets processed and go through the entire uh claim adjudication process you'll receive an array in this section here if you're not receiving any raise for a particular claim or you're receiving it on paper uh we can do the enrollment process for you you don't need to do it yourself uh many times practice tend to ask us for declaring houses information and to do the enrollment process themselves i mean you can we can avoid uh we can actually save you the trouble uh we do the edi and era enrollment on your behalf all we need is the name of the plan the address and the next thing is just about whether we offer era for that so there's a slight conception but uh we do all of that if you want to quickly review if the check has been received so these are all era we can expand it if you want to quickly review if there's a check in the system you can simply come to era files uh search for the check number here it should be in here if it's not then um somewhere either on paper or the payment has not been received so on and so forth okay so uh eligibility we all know where that can be checked from patients demographics or if you're scheduling appointments there's an option for eligibility here as well um you also have an auto legibility sets uh there's a preference set for every practice for your practice let's see what it's set to is set to one day so if we have appointment scheduled for let's say day after tomorrow the eligibility for all those appointments will run at midnight today so it reruns the eligibility anything you scheduled right now for tomorrow won't be auto verified because it's one day so it has to be prior to 24 hours otherwise the fund company doesn't work so any appointments that are being scheduled uh day after tomorrow are automatically uh verified and of course it has his own status is if you click on the icon it shows the response as well as you can see this was ran at 3 32 am so anything that is in the a m as being automatically run uh before the appointment so this takes care of the eligibility then we have the remittance advice that i showed and then we come across the denials because um we received denials in the form of eras uh also keep in mind that this number should not increase is currently at 3 53 it means either someone is not posting the era other times uh practice print these out and they posted manually uh again i believe i had a word with um i don't recall that person's name he was on call with another representative last week i asked him to send him send me an email if they need any refresher on the application he said let me know uh but anyways um so just make sure there's not a lot of uh areas in here even if there are you need to check if they're being posted because if these are not posted you won't they won't appear in your report and uh the new numbers will be down okay anything that is just one last thing anything that is not paid uh this is a deductible let me look for a denial so if if this is not being posted this is a c o b 13 reason is mentioned here uh if you post these eeras end up in this pocket so if you go to denials you can see a list of them here okay so anything that is being posted in the denial pocket if you uh submit the claim again resubmit the claim you figure out the denial reason it will end up in the in process bucket if you write the amount off it disappears transfer the balance to the next responsible plan it'll disappear so a few things you need to keep an eye on the denials remittance bucket the rejections making sure the clean bucket is um uh not too much because all you have to do is submit it to the click of a button uh you don't need to do it one at a time and finally the e super bill just make sure that they're creating super bills timely uh there's a lot of pages so um i think they need to work on that okay alright well i appreciate your help and just uh walking me through that no problem elena do you let me know if uh the billing staff uh does need any fresher i can always arrange at any time within the business hours so let me know if they need that okay absolutely well thank you so much no problen elena anything else i think that's it okay have a great day take care bye bye you too bye bye"}},

am good doc how are you doing today i'm doing well thank you great so um so this uh meeting was supposed to be done with erick but he's out sick so i will be filling in for him so i will i will go ahead and i will make you the presenter doctor so you can share your screen with me and uh let me know where are the issues you're facing okay so i'll send you the request so it's uh it's gonna prompt on your screen to share alright i can see the screen now i'm going to request for the keyboard and mouse controls too so please accept that request alright perfect okay can you now go ahead and take me to curemd okay and just for the record i'm gonna go ahead and record this session as well so i will share the recording right after sure sure no worries okay this conference will now be recorded alright i can see the screen now perfect so i guess you know for for some reason and also this is my schedule and hopefully we're not gonna take an hour probably way less than an hour so this is i believe my schedule some questions let's say i had seen yesterday uh uh benjamin am i able to create a note before he is being checked in um no doctor so uh in order to create the provide a note you first have to check the patient in and then it will allow you to because when you create so there are ways you can create uh you know provider note before the patient is in but uh the appointment will not be associated with that particular provider note so that is why this is the workflow that when the patient comes in you check them in and then you create the note okay okay okay another question is let's say i had theoretically 20 patients and i couldn't tried a note for one of those patients uh uh i am now having a little bit some time on my hand and i would like to go back you know yesterday and write my notes yeah that is a possibility you can uh write the provider notes that way so let me go ahead and i'm gonna take the mouse controls so let's say this is this is the your calendar for yesterday so i'm just gonna go ahead or do you have any appointment that is that you're supposed to do that was from the past and you haven't created the note no no problem so i'm just gonna go ahead and i'll book this patient on uh yesterday's date let's see i call it new okay so the workflow is going to be uh exactly the same you will just have to check in the appointment but i assume uh you know the appointment will be checked in from yesterday so if not then you can simply just click on the patient's name click on check in this window will open up this is where you know if you're supposed to enter any copay or anything i mean and then you will hit the save button and once this is gonna turn pink that means that this appointment is now checked in now when you click on the patient's name again it's gonna give you an option to create the note so this note will be created on um yesterday's date perfect perfect perfect now i noticed i was working on a patient done with my note i tried to sign and couldn't accept my signature okay and regarding a message i think i don't know if i emailed your email my assistant that the message was please find associate prescription uh yeah i get it uh i received a screenshot for that so let me show you why that was happening i'm just gonna go into this test patient and i'm gonna open up the provider note so this one is still in draft so let's let's open this one up alright so as you can see that on this provider note this is where you have an option for a prescription okay let's let's say you you are in a prescription section and you prescribed let's say this medication okay now while you're on the prescription you have multiple options at the bottom you can send an electronic prescription you can print it out or you can just hit the prescribed button and so so let me tell you the prescribed button is there so you can just document that this medication was prescribed it's not gonna actually send out any prescription electronically so let's say maybe maybe you're using a different system for electronic prescriptions so that's why this prescribed button is there so you you wouldn't be using this you're just gonna use erx so let's say while you are on prescription section rather than hitting the button you just maybe moved on to the next component okay and after the next component you just save and accept and you went back to your note now the prescription is documented but this prescription has not been signed and by sign i mean this prescription has not been sent out electronically okay okay um now just give me one moment uh currently you do not have the permissions to sign off on this note because this note was credit for somebody yes yeah that's fine okay so i'm just going to change it to your name and now you have an option to sign off so since we haven't sent out electronic prescription so once you click on sign is gonna give you that that's what i see i see so this is now i understand so all you need to do in this cases you will just go back to your prescription okay and you will simply just click on erx it will send out your prescription or let's say you don't want to send out the prescription you just added this prescription in error so you can remove it by right clicking on it remove the association and then since now no no prescription is associated with this note so once you sign it off is it will it will give you an option to sign off okay okay another question in the templates um it's like you guys implemented um some scales but what if i wanna use more than one skill is that possible definitely there is so by default we have associated p h u nine and gap seven in your provider note and even if you're not gonna use it and when you sign it off they will automatically disappear now let's say that other than p h u nine and gap seven you want to use any other then on the left hand side you have this option um just give me one moment just give me one moment let me update your permission real quick thank you take you time sorry about that take your time no no no worries okay now i just updated your permissions um just gonna take the controls no problem take take the controls i was just you can yup okay let's save this page alright so now let's say uh whatever you need additional forms or additional additional scales you will simply put the cursor there okay and right next to it you have an option that says custom form okay so once you click on add it's gonna bring up the list of all scales uh that we have in the system for you so we have 24 training tools whichever one you want to use you can simply select it it's gonna open up on your note and as you will fill it out let's say you selected a couple of options and once you hit the accept button it will be attached to your provider note there you go excellent and it's not limited to it i mean if you are unable to find any scales in the custom form section and you you need a new one in your application so you can always let us know you can share a sample with us that this is what you need and we will add it into your system can i do that without you know going back to you guys or or i cant um that way you will be able to do it but uh uh it's it's a long process uh and you would require a detailed training on it so we do have a design team uh in house who actually work on these requests every day so they're pretty good and you know they're fast so they'll be able to provide uh provide you the solution in no time excellent excellent now the other question uh and i haven't really looked into it but i noticed one of my assistants i think he raised that that question regarding the psych evaluation uh so part of the psych evaluation not the follow up not but the psych evaluation um we need like a previous like history okay and i think in the past you are doing a presentation and you guys had a previous like history but in a different section and i think he made a comment that it will be better to be added in the past psychiatric evaluation or do you recall anything like that i know you do a lot of presentations um just give me one moment is is this something uh that you're talking about doctor uh part of it yes part of it yes but you know previous part of it yes alright just give me one moment i think we have a couple more no that's not the one so are you going to custom as well and looking with or how do you uh yes so there are a couple of farms in the custom form section as well um however specifically i'm not sure uh which one because simon in a complete psychiatric evaluation you have to have a section under past psych history and then the the past psych history the previous psychiatric hospitalization previous suicide attempt previous medication trials and i i don't know if i have even past psychiatric history is in the initial evaluation or no um okay but i could be wrong but you were explaining i think part of it and you said i think jessica given you in the past packages that you're gonna um add to the template so it can be added to that initial psychiatric evaluation um okay i will actually have to uh go through jessica's emails if i'm able to find uh you know if the template was shared if not i mean if you have any uh hold on just give me one moment i think i found another one this is also one of the form that we have intake assessment form okay no that's not the one i'm talking about honestly but you guys done really a lot of work honestly like even when i show how you guys have good stuff great um good stuff perfect that's really good to know so doctor if you can uh provide me the template uh that you want to be added in the system then uh you can just email it to me and i will have that added thank you simon last question i'm sure that that i think was raised to you guys or actually two more questions so it was raised to you guys about sending post dated medicaid so we were using waiting room solution sometimes you can just add several prescriptions control medication he wants to and then you can just send them all at once yes doctor so during i actually i actually had a detailed discussion with jessica on this and i am currently working with our development team we have confirmed uh with with doctor first as well that they do accept that and we are gonna start working on the development of that feature uh pretty soon and hopefully in the next couple of weeks i will be able to get back to you with an update amazing amazing i'll be patient if i have a patient and i just want to refill the medication do i have a bond what i just push the button and it will have like refill the option instead of putting the information again um one moment let me show it to you uh just give me one moment let me check one thing real quick okay so in order to do the refills so you can just simply open any patient's chart i mean to whomever you want to do the medication refill okay this is a test patient so you will go to so you are not going to create a separate provider note uh whenever there's a medication refill required right usually we do like a note and very brief note like in cold and asking for refills okay i think that makes sense because we like to document any conversation with patients i think we do have a provider note template for that i spoke with jessica about this okay yes so uh what you will do in that case is um excellent medication okay okay so this is the phone encounter template that we have so you will simply select the reason um it's gonna be phone encounter okay and then you will simply go and create the note just like any other and on this template all you have is the prescription you have the patient information so i can simply just open the prescription flag and let's say if you want to prescribe the previous medications that you prescribed to this one so you can simply select those medication under the current medication section so let's say if you have prescribed tylanol to this patient in the past so once you click it it's gonna bring that information over here otherwise you can always look up for the medication in the library uh let's say if i select this abilify and this is how it's gonna bring that information you can enter the number of days it will auto calculate the tablets and you can simply just uh do the e r x yeah okay e x okay okay so so for this one the workflow is slightly different let me walk you through it again so since there are not going to be any scheduled appointment so you will not follow the check in process all you need to do is you will just go to the patient's module you will look up for your patient so let's say i looked up this patient and you will go under provider note from the left hand side click on provider note and you will add a phone encounter in that case excellent okay your note template medication will be pre selected you will select the visit reason that is a phone encounter and the rest of the work lowest same so you can simply just open it up and you can prescribe the medication okay okay it's a pretty easy from there yep and what i'm sorry how did you look up the patient go to find the patient yes so in order to look up one uh you will have to go to this module this patient module this module now i see it okay and this is her yep okay and you can switch to the advanced tab this is where you have multiple options to search for the patient you can enter last name first name their social security number any one of the information not all of them are required and whichever information uh you wanna look up for so you will excellent i appreciate that simon no problem at all the last issue one last issue and then you can go and forgive me i'm making this really you're very sweet thank you the video call you know i think we're having a lot of issues with the video um are you guys working on the yes doctor yes so hopefully by tomorrow the fix will be deployed for all your practice providers uh there was actually a duplication in the email addresses of the practice users so since all your practice staff they were using uh mutual email so that's and when we associated those users to your profile so that was actually causing a conflict so our development team is going to deploy the fix hopefully by tomorrow and uh it will be smooth from the day after and i am i am not handy like your computer savvy is it easy to use the video call exactly yes thats easy alright perfect simon you have done amazing job thank you so much no problem at all doctor thank you so much for your time thank you for being patient with us in this process thank you no problem sir take care take care simon have a good one you too bye bye bye bye

uh which is under the am better and you're getting the rejection uh that uh subscriber already not found and uh you even call the insurance and the patient is eligible yes that is correct what is the patient's name uh the patient i can give you the patient account number okay the patient account number is 19794 get here gonzalez 197 941919794 okay let me check here okay yes so the thing is that previously when you submitted the claim the policy number was not correct but someone from your practice change the policy number and now the patient is eligible and you can also resubmit the claims okay let me see let me see what i have uh when i called am better i gave them the policy number that we had here on the system the u and uh the u 9276770701 because that's the only number that we have uh the thing is that on on 28th of may jeanie guerrera someone from your practice change the policy number previously it was u 927577 and then uh jeanie changes to you 927677 which is correct okay so but i i asked him i asked her i asked am better do we have the uh correct number you know this so this u9276770701 is that the correct one yes because when you call them you ask them about this number but when you submitted the claim that was submitted with a different policy number okay like uh what i'm saying is previously it was submitted with the wrong policy number but someone from your practice first corrected yeah but let me see what's the old what's can you give me the old one u927577 7577 0701 this is the old one u u9275770701 that's the old and the new one and you said that one was was was posted on 5 28 um yes like uh jeanie changed it on 5 28 so you might have called the insurance uh and asking them about the new policy number but when the claim was submitted it was submitted with the old policy number okay so i'm okay so this one when i called in i gave him the new one and that one let me see okay i bet we're gonna trade up okay so this is what i have it was on when the claim was submitted on 520 electronic and they still didn't show claims they still didn't show the claim so i guess let me call him again no no can we do a screen share session yes uh huh

enable audio controls please enter your audio pin followed by the pound or hash sign if you do not have a pin just press pound or hash hi abigail it's heather and doctor greco hi this is abigail hey doctor dot com hi heather just give me a minute okay no problem this diagnosis part doesn't matter without doing the billing something the right thing to do would be to have it on show me how to do that it's like 36 or something it was like and i was like oh very soon in here and then yeah for every 0.9 31-30 1.9 mhm so if we start saved in my favorites and every time i do that i'll have already pre populated here recently you come up and since we're using the same thing do that next time and then you'll have everything that you put in before and it'll be a little bit faster that way too um but yeah i think that we do that with the billing i don't think that that's necessarily hard you just have to literally look it would be like okay vital hi thank you for staying on hold i think we had an audio problem okay we're good now yes we are so um let's discuss templates i'll open your database okay so how's your experience so far and um what are the things we are going to change in the templates let's start with that so we're pretty happy with the initial and pre templates but the one change we want to make is the flag that's there for complaints take that out and we want to know if we can add a custom category hpi just have it and then just type underneath it if you need to modify something free type under that title so it should be hpi flag custom flag and what would it look like does the free text once you open it yeah so you can just put above that and then have like a area where you can type so there's somebody of a different complaints or there's something else you wanna add to it i don't i don't really like the complaint drop down box and having to select and do everything i prefer is to be able to type it okay i can give you a free text box for that let me make note is there um is there a way i guess so we use an e 66 point oh one code as the b city code and that requires a code as a diagnosis next is there a way for the b m i from the vitals to flag that to a code for diagnosis is always have to be paid by us oh so um the diagnosis uh flag is not integrated with any of the vitals or any other components it's kind of a standalone components is there a way for the note to reflect the level billing that you're supposed to do based off of your note yeah so system can recommend a level code for example you can have if you are searching um if we enable auto population of code system is going to select a code for you but 80% of the time because right now we do not have to pay that go ahead please i'm sorry no no i was just gonna say and if it does auto selected can you change it if you want yes so that is um the disclaimer that 80% of the time because right now um new cms guidelines um are recently out and some of them are not complete in terms of what code system should select so right now the selection is based on the number of complaints system and physical exam 80% of the time you might have to change it manually so if you would like to go with what system recommends and you would like to change it as well that's an option so i think what i'm trying to say is that you might have to change it every time 80% of the time yeah i don't i don't think it's worth doing that i mean if we could see i know when i looked at it assigned e super bill that i am just detail i can see what the recommendation for the coding is i think that that's gonna be sufficient for us because i think we bill at a higher level than what would be i don't know that it would match up i think i picked the weird um are you able to share your screen with us um so we can yeah so we can click through with you and and kinda see where you're at sure i'll do that well it helped me learn uh not yet the the box is open but i don't see your actual screen yet click on your name hold on let me check why uh it shows in the preview maybe it's minimized or something if you it says that you're sharing but i just feel i can i can do that again let me stop it and share it again hopefully you're not on a mac because apple sometimes puts restrictions no it's dell so i am i've shared it again mm computer uh it says everyone talk um i think it's on our end i mean like what would be a meeting without some kind of issue but um yeah i can i can i can make you presenter and maybe you can share yours that would be good and then if you wanna walk me through i can change it myself sure so i have i think we ran into an issue with this last time to the hospital yes if sometimes there's a firewall or some kind of restrictions then yes it's understandable i have shared i've sent you a request so that you can share yours if you have a share button there then it's good to go but if the share button is grayed out then it means that you cannot share the screen either it's grayed out um that's strange usually i'm able to share mine yeah i've seen before i don't know why it's not allowed uh it says now you're the presenter so yeah tell me you're sharing that was my my we're gonna see if we can log into one of the other computers and i'll pull it up that way but right now we're kinda um i'm gonna log in under mine because i have the link sure alright i'm gonna go with me i i it doesn't seem to be working so i'm gonna if you could walk me through or i'll i'll click through as we go through it alright so um i'm not sure where we were now so are you were you able to add that hpi box or was that what we are looking to do now i can hold on let me do it i can try to do it on the go okay because i know how to get into templates too if you wanna walk me through it i can do that as well no problem let me let me let me create a hpi customs form real quick and then all of them so as you can do you don't make a new one so all of them with a free tax oh it's just a free floating thing uh medical surgical medications allergies is good because it always has no heartburn and usually we're trying to do reflux rate and enjoy paying because we need them for you because we don't take them off yeah i yeah i have to go in and create what we want to note and then create it yeah i can't get into what i have to do is into a note that you actually like the way it looks like so can you open your uh no template bariatric follow up for four months and then you can uh you can see that i've added an hpi flag so i'm going in the four month one uh what happened okay yeah i see it there so then what does that look like it's just it opens up and then underneath that fold category will be the free text whatever we text in yes you can so free taxes kind of fully uh free tax it's not it's not gonna give you an option to search anything so there's not gonna be search option you can simply start to type yeah we don't need that okay so click on it it's so what i wanna go into like a note then i'll be able to see it so the question is can you pull in more obesity into that like the the template we can create a couple more could be one that goes in there we can is it possible so um the hpi right now you have it so we can just type in underneath it is it possible to do click boxes in there because there's certain things that are common you know that put in that area so if we can put more obesity um what else did you want hi hernia like can i email you a list list is better emailing is better all the things all the h commonly used h p i you need i can i can have a check box there for that okay so we're gonna create um boxes to choose from for hpi and then we can just subject yep so and and we can have both doctors and subjective tax if we need to i'll need the hpi to go into all of them okay before we said okay so we'll discuss that and i'll send you a separate email so that we can get that added and then um one of the other things that i know we went through it the last time sending the note to the primary care physician so last night i went in i added a patient's primary and their demographics um their phone number and their fax number and then when we were in the note where how do we send it from there so if we're in a note on the top it says send try to send it so the location that we're referring to is uh last name is derosa d e r o s a patricia yeah so when you click the send button um it gets gives you an option that if you would like to fax it out and then you have an option to simply uh so select the name there's one more option though that system automatically sends out the provider note as soon as it is signed okay so if we have the providers fax number in once it's signed it automatically send yes we we decided we didn't want to do that because there's certain appointments that we do send for another one so i'm in the note now i do the drop down for send and where do i go from here what do you see on the screen um i see the note that was created and then on the top i can do send and then i've got the options from send do you see the from and the two buttons the word too is clickable click on it i'm sorry say that again the word too it's a blue hyperlink if you click on it it will open another city exactly mm let me see where are you right now i think so i'm in the note yeah so are you talking about in the drop down i should see in the yes in the send drop down let's click fax and then it will show you the preview of the note hold on but i'm not seeing that so what i have is is titled h and p note preview uh hold on hold on let me go back i want to be on the same page with you when i click back uh thai yeah so from here click okay there's an okay button oh okay and then i do too and then i put the yeah you can check the name and him and then i excel or search excuse me okay so i and then i do from it automatically is from okay so it's gonna be either number or it can give you the name of the user who's sending it okay um my form drop down select and it's pre populated with my name which is fine um i think i'd rather say from the practice is that a template thing or sure so from from you would like to what would you like to add in the front name of the practice i'd like yeah i'd like to be from and they will lost okay and then have our number phone number right do you do you have for that it's not on our right so it's not on our notes so we need to have um maybe on our note we need a letter that would be the answer cover she doesn't matter the note that should have we can if you can give me a sample of cover sheet it can it automatically attached as i can also do that okay yeah i'll do that i'm gonna email you the dropbox i'm gonna email you a cover sheet for our fax um okay so now i see how to do it the fault instead of a select yeah we can deposit and then uh okay and then how do we know if they received it sure so you can go to the home page or the dashboard and on the left menu there is an option that says administration if you expand it the fax status fax status log yeah and then from here you can see the status as sent or there are two drop 2 tabs incoming and outgoing like that okay and then that kind of brings me to my next question i know we were set up with um i don't know what that number is and if we do have incoming faxes where does that go and how do i file it from there so all the incoming faxes are going to drop into document manager if you go to the fourth module from the left it's document manager right and in document manager yeah the second tab is fax inbox so all of the faxes will will drop here and if you will click on name of the patient you will see some folders there and you can drag and drop your faxes into the relevant folder off the patient i understand all that you're the ones you're seeing there the notes that we uploaded patients um documents so is there medical gonna be i keep getting a server error is that on my end or is that something with cure oh can you screenshot and send it to me i'll i'll take a look are you on a chrome or explorer uh i think i'm in chrome yeah we have we have to use chrome for everything got it so i mean chrome i think it's where do you click and get the other it is 404 i have to log back in i got that i was uh looking in the the back uh i was in the the document manager i had clicked on one of the uh the pdf i guess something that had been uploaded from there and i keep getting an error like a document manager documents and then i click one of the things that are below the cursi 5.5 yeah i don't even have to click it and just being in the document manager is giving me a server error okay just clicking the document manager can you please send me the screenshot i will see yeah i'll show you how to do that it says 404 file or directory okay strange it's very well could be this computer this isn't the one that i normally work off office um so yeah every time i go in it seems to be popping up so it might be on this end but i'm gonna email that to you oh before i forget so when we wanna put medications into the system for the patient is there a way to do that without a dose so whenever we pick up medication where like in order to move forward we have to select the dough for the patient and sometimes it's not we don't have that information or sometimes it's not accurate so is there a way to drop that requirement so we can just put the type of medication that they're on because we're not managing i mean i'd like to still have the option but i don't want it to be necessary to move forward because then we're kind of putting incorrect information uh in that case what we can do is i can add medication in the system um but that is going to be a custom medication so for that i'll be i'll be needing the list so that i can add it if you'll search from the library it will come with the dosage but we don't wanna do the dosage i know what you're saying i can add it as um okay so instead of just a list there like maybe not like a medication templates almost like a free text i guess but the problem is that i won't default into the next and is there also was doing that so if you put someone vitals in like their height that's not gonna change um and the weight changes right so instead of having to put height and weight every time you get to just save yeah pretty populate for every note going forward um yeah so we get that a lot that the height should be should auto populate and we should not because uh it's highly unlikely that the height will changes let me check if there is a way yeah this is this is this is the fake note i think what she's saying is when i put it in there's literally no way to do that well if i searched the library then i'm happy to picking a but if i i'm just trying to take my point there's no way to do with those so instead of providing you because our patients are on all different kinds of medications that wouldn't be feasible to give you a list of medications to add is it possible to add a custom like in medication the only way to search the medication is to pick from the library if i had an option to add my own would that be our solution to bypass the thing so the the medication library is the only way to add medication let me test it for like when i do a surgical history you don't have all the surgical history i can i can add one and save it as a medic as a surgery but not have to put any details like just put back surgery but uh see a tubal you know like i can add it to your medications can make sense uh how do we do that yeah you can you can you can simply click on it and then um it it links with the pharmacy yeah it contacts the surescript server and gets the information and how do you do a patient consent for that because that might be kind of the solution for the issue that we're having just give me a minute let me get and do all the pharmacy surescript it should because that's how like they standardized everything so they know who's prescribing what medications okay that would be amazing man because they missed that i gotta look you know and then it automatically update just get on and take we always review that as we go it's easy enough to something that they're on so what we need to build into our four month follow up or potentially have to figure out with the guys medications to help build a different level you know i guess it doesn't matter i think this is pretty solid now what we need to care about so we have a council on hp i don't mean the council for they come in for something different maybe more of a generic conversation we have the hp dropbox really the only thing that changes just uh and then it should be generic for everything this medication thing is i'm trying to test so i did i added a word medication so that you can select the word medication from the library and then at the but then that's gonna be not helpful because then you have to write the name of the medicine in patient instructions i think that's not gonna help yeah if we can if we can do that yeah if we can do that our history um that's definitely something i'd be interested in pulling straight from the pharmacy rather than adding all the individual meds rx history is um is is is that if you go to medications are you able to see our existed in the top right corner yeah give me a a work that patient hasn't consented for it so how do i how do i get consent to that to allow that to happen so uh it's just a notification it's not a hard stop the consent option but it's um if it says your request cannot be processed because of the following reasons it means that patient does not have um active coverage or patient does not have a record with your surescripts uh maybe he's using some of the vendor so technically red alert that came up no problem what is the name of the patient uh the patient i'm doing is that uh de rosa it's the only new one that i know that we did recently so um i'm kinda using it for for everything patricia de rosa okay um it only told her vaccine it didn't pull any for medication not helpful so that's not gonna help us because it's gonna be consistent we just have to figure out like when you start to see somebody's further out we're gonna put them in the computer system and then you can but then you're not gonna put their medications like i had somebody yesterday log 54 units but then when you click on the log there's like 12 options everyone you know 30 is 100 the right information that you accurate but like the options are always there it's too many steps to update the medications when we get a patient 15 minutes it becomes an issue i don't mind doing it once the problem is like i said as i was trying to do it i couldn't figure out what to do i think there's like 30 different councils and then if you just pick one just pick one it's not true you're inconsistent mhm you're right they're all um yeah and i need the hpi on this one cause like i put liquid and see what i did down there and plan or something like that i mean you told me about the drop down free taxes it's nice having all that stuff to click down but i can't comment on any of that so patricia what was the last name again de rosa d e r o s a she had reported to us she's on metformin um but when we do the history only her vaccine comes up not the metformin that's been prescribed got it let me check what in what alert do i get okay so they're not always we go to medications where they go to our history yes so this means that only the the vaccine was um prescribed or administered and was available on shortscript portal metformin or whatever she was taking with either through paper prescription or some other vendor we only are connected with surescript i actually think i mean it's good to know that how to do that because what i'll do is i'll do that first and then i'll look at the list and anything that i can take some of it yeah no that that that was helpful to learn how to do any different surescript of one of the the largest vendors sorry what was your question you guys don't have it yep you don't have a contract with the other ones at the story yes um this this kind of contracts are difficult um because we are using surestrips as a vendor so that is why it's easier for us to create a path with other it kinda becomes very challenging because we're not taking the services for prescriptions um so everything else on my list but i think i'm gonna wind up um emailing to you it's more template creation stuff and we'll kind of put our heads together on what exactly we need and i'll i'll write it out for you um but one question i do have is scanning and scanning in cure um is there if we want to scan insurance card are there specific scanners that we should be looking to purchase um what would be the easiest way to scan in the copy of the insurance card okay so for the insurance card did our card scanners and we have a list of recommended devices or anything any device recent model that is incompatible when is a driver and if it is too incompatible it should be uh good to go with curemd but i can also send you the list that we have that we recommend yeah if you if you could do that that would be great because that is something that will do it all the offices and then we'll just work with our it i'm making sure that it connects alright cool and then we did we shoot you show me where the faxes go but what's the number or how do people fax into our here sure i can give you our fax number mm it's it's actually your practices fax number let me open it up i don't really know how that works either because you can because we're trying to get all the paperwork yep it shouldn't be something that they should be able to do you know mhm before and then there's the office if somebody just time and if he's moving too fast for kelly or you and he's waiting on patients i don't see how that's gonna work at all unless they can get it before they go home abigail while you're working on that i do have one other question and then i think we're good for today go ahead please how do we have it so that patients can fill out some of their information ahead of time is there like a link to send them is there because what we're doing is patients fill out paper paperwork and then they bring it in and we enter all the information before we sit with the patient and it's not really conducive to our workflow um is there a way for patients to enter some of this information themselves ahead of time or even the scan paperwork that we i think we have talked about that once before and i can't remember how it works okay so we have a patient portal app it's a patient engagement app and uh when you say paperwork what kind of is it like check boxes drop down or is it just simply something they can sign i'm gonna send it to you so you can take a look at it i don't know if it's able to be built in a way that it's dropped down but right now it's literal paperwork that they fill out um it feels that they enter information in too okay then what we can do is i can show you the patient portal workflows we can sit together and i'll i'll walk you through it's kind of a complete training session and then you can decide if that would be no workable for your patience yeah that would that would be great i mean any time the patient can enter their own information um would definitely save us in the office that would be helpful okay great uh you can send me the forms and we can build it for you um i'm not able to i think i have to kind of go to the previous old records and get your fax number give me uh give me some time and i'll email it to you you can just you wanted to yeah i was gonna say i'll do follow up emails on a couple of things that we talked about if you could just get back to me with that and the compatible card scanners um i think we're we're good for today and i really appreciate you going you know call by call with us but it's helping us piece it together okay no problem happy to help okay so if there's anything i can email you too

what's the name we have one going in here so this is the one that's pulling up when you're going ahead and selecting referral from the criteria and it's also pulling up from death referral source physician for the other two let me check again there is a referral in here so for that criteria it's only pulling up from what has been documented in there demographics as a referring provider for more okay alright so this is a big big difference that we need to start going by because the the referral source uh when you're talking about an actual referral that's only when we have an authorization so we're missing a ton of referrals if it's only counting the ones that have an authorization because that's how that's utilized for us so okay well i appreciate that and uh we'll start advising um everyone to not pull it that way right right and you said you had another question as well no um it was just a massive uh difference because i thought umm that it was going to be based off you pulling the referral source um because this is the kind of massive difference that i'm looking at uh this physician uh right here uh right here uh when when we go here off referral we get five i believe sorry no you're not reflecting the grouping oh group by references maybe this would give us oh i'm so sorry that's not the position it's supposed to be jeremy all right here okay so we're saying five but then when i went in to do it by demographics was 22 so just a massive 32 i'm sorry a massive amount of um patients being missed out on that report yeah it's basically the search criteria how you go ahead and describe that okay so we just need to be pulling everything from demographics instead of these referrals then okay well thank you very much can i go ahead and close the support ticket yes sir alright good day bye you too"}}, {"id": 44, "data": {"call_id": "1620326707.754982.txt", "text": "thank you so much for calling curemd support my name is ryan and how may i

about yourself ashley how are you doing today good thank you hold on let me uh let me close my door real quick hold on one moment okay okay thanks for holding okay that is okay uh so ashley i believe uh you guys have switched over to a different software uh which i believe is chiro specific um yes we just we have not you know because of covid and stuff we stopped using curemd and the billing um and we would just like to um cancel moving forward um and i would like to pay our balance as well um that we have with you guys um but i just wanna make sure that we are on the same page and are able to cancel and move forward okay another few things that we will be taking into consideration uh before we move on to that i believe uh can you please name me the software that you guys have switched over to like i believe you guys switched over in the past quite a while ago uh because it was chiro specific something um why is that relevant that is uh part of our information process uh it helps us keep a track that how many clients we lost if they switched over to a different software competitors market value and all of that stuff so it helps us go further i mean we we learn a lot from this process so the information that we gather is not something that is kind of like you know gonna hinder the process it is actually something that helps us internally to build ourselves more and more for the client and in places for example certain clients they tell us okay this is a competitor that we went over this is the uh price price was a factor or system uh you had system deficiency they had this and then we compare if there is something that we can provide them with we also help them and those for example if it is a price bracket to break we if it is uh possible for us to do that we even go ahead and do that if there is i would i would not like to share that um with you we are still in the process of deciding also part of the reason why we are switching with you guys had violated multiple hippa violations um that we have documented on our end um so that is another reason why we would like to cancel okay so anything specific like uh you mentioned that hipaa violations so what are are the kinds of hipaa Violations so we can work uh in terms of i can investigate with the team as well who was actually handling your account and see what went wrong okay let me see if i can pull up my documentation okay um off the top of my head i know that some statements were sent to different patients um you guys have contacted a patient that was not the correct patient that you were supposed to be contacting um just off the top of my head right now statements sent to wrong patient i should have that i mean we have called you guys when this stuff happens you guys should have that documented on your end as well i mean that is uh definitely i am gonna be looking into it as well because uh part of the process of this is uh not to just help improve curemd but also see if there are any ingredients is that the client had we can take a look into it what went wrong or what the actual causation was and if there is something that we can reconcile or solve or help um you know get things improved then definitely you know input from both sides is valuable for uh our team to make assessment and then take a step further so what do we need to do moving forward to to to cancel okay so if we just talk about cancellation uh you guys signed up a contract uh let me take a look at the contract an upgraded contract on i believe february 2018 and that one is going to expire around march 2023 you are 39 months into it and there are 21 month left to serve for the contract term so there are multiple ways to go about it one is for example if you need the records next to the data you can keep a single user license active so that will allow you to have the complete access as you currently have and uh single user license let me see mm mm mm and you said it was february 2024 march 2023 march 2023 because if we add 21 months from now so i think it goes up to march 2023 so single user would be around i mean i can confirm that from the sales team for your practice what exact amount would be but i can give you a rough ballpark figure something between uh 2 50 to 400 most probably could be less than that as well but that depends because i need to touch base with the sales who actually made the contract for your practice i can get you that figure amount the other is you can uh go for the data extraction that is get the entire thing ported over to your new system whosoever is the new system whatever format you wanted it it is kind of like 7 to 8 k depending upon the amount of data that you guys have so the entire uh data set for the concern provider will reported over to your new system 7000 to $8,000 yes and uh the other thing uh in order to close the account completely like for example if you say like uh if you do not want to complete the term you are like we wanna terminate um and uh cancel the contract right now then you can um pay the early termination penalty i think that would be accumulated 21-month payment and i believe that provided license fee i mean something roughly about that so that would be your early termination penalty and you can immediately close the account with curemd that way how much is that i mean i do not have the exact figures for it but i can fetch those figures uh from the legal team who actually deals with the contract it will be a remainder term uh can emulate you can pay for the remainder term and i believe there is any license charge that they put over it for the one provider to providers depending upon how many providers you have active with curemd at the moment okay so i can get that figured from the legal team and share that with you that would be great so uh three routes whichever one you believe like will be cost effective that could be done in the meantime um ashley i believe this is kind of like our first interaction uh i do not know maybe you might be or or a second interaction maybe we might have spoken in the past but i would really love to know more about for example which team dealt with you because there is something uh i mean you you spoke about hipaa violation and i really wanna see where uh it happened even if it happened or did not happen i wanna make sure that if that loophole definitely happened and i am just uh now i am a little more upset that its been uh probably over a year since anyone has even cared or reach out that you guys violated hipaa and now suddenly when we wanna cancel because you guys made a mistake now you guys are worried about it that is that is a little concerning to me no i mean we will reach out to you on cases for example definitely if if the client is planning to leave if the client has a concern if the client has uh for example anything that they have reported to curemd so far so for example if you have reported something in the past if you could share a thread with me where you can let me know oscar this is what it reported i have not heard back from anyone so um i can definitely dig reach out directly to you then you can definitely reach out to me directly in in case if you experience a lack of response from any department okay just in case for example if if you are like currently you said that you have recently stopped billing with curemd uh for the azure or something or you guys were actively doing billing from curemd we were actively doing billing through through you guys um and then we had a few again hipaa violations that i think i think that folders in another room so i do not have it handy right now um that is okay you can uh always get the billings mhm but i can send you um i can either give you a call back and leave you a voice mail with the details um or uh shoot you an email uh for you to give me a call and you have a moment but um i would like to go over these options with doctors barton before i make a decision and i would like to get you that hipaa violation information as well um before we do anything moving forward is that okay no that is perfectly fine i mean uh as i told you uh feel free to talk to me at any point of time you feel like you know uh be very free about it at any point of time even if the price factor is also like i just do not want you to talk about something that you only felt okay the price was not a big deal for us but still if you feel like you know there are other factors that you think curemd can help you out and you know improve their relationship at any point of time i would definitely want you to be vocal about it with me and feel comfortable while talking to me because at this point of time when when we you know listen to you only then um i mean i will be able to get to a certain point that okay this is uh what we can do for you this is what what what can be done and uh the first things first i am gonna get that uh three options information with the cost on it so i can sure that way you could give me the um the exact price for the early termination penalty and then also the first option that you gave me to have access um because you give me a you know single user license yep yep yep yep yep yep single user license access is just to let you know what it actually is because there is also an option of free only personally why i do not recommend a read only option is it gives you a very basic scratching the surface information so if you want to go dig deep into it what what you wrote in the provider note or you know the complete access you have right now you will not be able to it will give you the number to see the patients documents correct it will just give you a very short clinical summary sign off this type of thing so what about if a patient was asking if if we did go with a single user license um the patient was asking for their previous statement from like i do not know two years ago would i be able to obtain that with the single user license you only keep one provider active and with that you have like for example the provider have five users in the practice they can access it at any point in time even if 12 o clock midnight you know there is a patient who is a friend of yours and you guys are kind of like you know on a road or a trip and he kinda like or she kind of like asks you you know i need this information even at that point of time 12 o clock midnight you can access the system you can get the information at that point of time okay anything that you documented you can have that information by a single user license access because you are inside the system okay alright so let me get um let me touch base with doctor barton and then um i will wait to hear from you with those numbers and then i will look um i will get that file um for you as well thank you and appreciate anything else that i can help you out with ashley no i will talk to you soon all right thank you and have a wonderful day"}}, {"id": 55, "data": {"call_id": "1620759744.824435.txt", "text": "thanks for calling curemd this is brian how may i help you hi um my name is hannah and i'm here at the

you sound your accent sounds very familiar to our doctor i'm originally from pakistan oh okay that's why i just feel like you know okay okay okay doctor um is that okay if i can connect with your screen we need to discuss uh the things disappearing and changing yeah yeah please so do you have any desk application installed doctor yeah yeah i have it and then i have the number you want me to give you the number that your desk can be access to this address 558 709792 okay so i'm gonna accept this okay so same thing doctor i believe this is another computer that you're using or this is uh yeah today i'm using my laptop because i didn't go to work i really want to know what's going on before more patient because yeah right actually doctor i'm still not able to connect with your screen if you remember we discussed uh last time uh if you're using mac there are certain permissions that needs to be enabled um do you remember i am using mac pro macbook pro yeah right so do you remember how we changed those settings earlier last week when we discussed it we need to do the same settings on this computer there must be some uh accessibility options in there where uh you can uh add any desk to all the options yeah you know what my husband remember my husband came and he helped and do you think you can give me the directions let me do that just give me one minute doctor because i can i can take him on the call so you know like a conference call so he can maybe guide uh he was the one who downloaded the software but you yourself uh made those changes so now on any desk doctor do you see that option as somewhere where it says security and privacy or something related to accessibility uh configure configure permission in order to access your desk remotely need to grant to configure open system preference right any desk right uh any desk will not be able to record the contents of your screen until it is quit should i go ahead and quit no no doctor uh there should be uh on your left hand side you see certain options uh accessibility system recording and stuff like that okay so i have uh accessibility um and remember when when i hit the accessibility i cannot uh hit on the any desk because it should learn there there was a lock option down below uh i have screen recording not that one right then analytic and improvement no so uh wherever you see any desk first you unlock the option uh down below and then whenever you see any desk you simply need to check that uh any desk uh because on the top it says privacy should i say general it should be under privacy yes under privacy um and the privacy accessibility yeah accessibility when i hit accessibility it's just a bit blurred any desk and i can't uh mark it i don't know the same thing happened last time and then i think my husband came in uh no no no doctor uh so when when it's a greyed out there should be a lock option down below uh to click on it and to make changes there should be some option like oh yeah you told me last time yeah i got it now yeah yeah no system preferences is trying to unlock security and privacy preferences i need to enter your password allowed to do this use password um use password so my husband i used a password that day i'm i'm not sure uh is it asking you for a password yeah i tried to put on that okay usually so it worked right it worked yes it worked okay so any desk and then i clicked on any desk now what do you want me to do okay let me connect with your screen again and see if i'm able to connect with your screen okay so i will accept it okay it's loading now i can see you there right um i'm uh trying to access your screen okay i can see your screen so what we can we can move this any desk option on the right yeah so um for some reason i'm not able to take some clothes okay okay so doctor can you please open the application i can see your screen now yeah okay thanks so so okay so where do you want me to go like um you can just sign in yeah yeah i'm like which location do you want me to go in the one we discussed the last time doctor uh i'm sorry the one we discussed the last time do you remember the name of that patient yeah i have to because there were multiple patients have you discussed the one yeah i remember let me just quickly look at my because i'm like finding out more patients i'm just adding more and more so let me go and check okay just a second it saved in my photo album thing jefferson mm yeah judy heritage actually i have a lot of patients but we were discussing more just just give me one heritage okay what i'm doing is i'm going to open uh your practice on my end because i believe i opened the same patients account as well so let me see if i can find it just give me one can you see judy heritage i opened her okay i will you want me to let you do it okay yes just give me one minute okay so yes it was judy alright so let's open up this patient's account doctor SO our main concern was that when we go to was it diagnosis yeah we go to the diagnosis and then uh in the diagnosis there was one diagnosis that has been removed okay so let me tell you what exactly went wrong there doctor so we click on the diagnosis mhm and do you see where we can go to past yeah and that particular diagnosed was moved to past and the reason was inactive so let me tell you how exactly i got into into the i talked to the technical team but it's not even in the past you know it's not even in the past right then maybe it was uh completely removed it was not moved to the past because uh for in our office they told me that they cannot remove it if you if you make a diagnosis one time there's nobody else can remove it except cure md that's what they told me and we cannot i mean i tried to remove it too but i couldn't it only go in the past that's all we can do okay but i don't know if anybody in the office knows exactly you know just give me one minute let me confirm that as well and before like two months before there wasn't anything in the past when i used to go in the past i will retrieve my past notes because one of our um one of the person who works for my husband um she was pushing moving all my notes to the past i told her so many times and then my husband has to tell her you know you stopped doing that because this is how i see my patients you know because i'm doing telehealth and i need to have a whole picture of the patient so then um she even then i had to retrieve a lot of notes from the past to bring them to this present and then um and that hello so whenever hello can you hear me so so whenever i go to the past for the last two months i just see inactive and i don't see nothing no past notes from me okay uh so doctor um yes you cannot delete the diagnosis because those ones are um already associated with the provider note and connected with that particular patient so you're not able to delete them but you can always uh put them in the past just give me one minute i'm just trying to access one more thing okay so what i think and the technical team thinks doctor because uh you remember you showed me a certain screenshots in the documents section but that's yeah yeah right especially right so that particular document was um uh you know the picture was taken a few days ago when the patients had all those diagnosis and then they will move to pass so whenever the whenever you move the diagnosis into the past uh somebody did move them and you would not be able to um you know locate those uh diagnosis uh in the current provider note because they moved to past if you look at a particular past uh diagnosis so you can see that uh you can see all the logs here so doctor syed muhammad added them in the past and selected the reason as inactive so if we go to current i'll show you how it can be done but what happened to the note that was written like one of the diagnosis is sent in the past but what about the assessment and plan that was attached with that diagnosis where is that who deleted that and um the most important thing is muhammad syed that of course my husband is not doing doing it because he has given his password to three different people who work for him because of course he cannot sit down and do all those coding all the time so so it's it's just like a really it's a it's a matter of you know like um do you understand what i mean i understand your perspective you're saying that um the diagnosis that they put it in the past so then they will make it inactive right they are making it an active not cure md is that right right so uh the inactive means does not mean doctor that uh the diagnosis are not no longer uh in the system no no no they're there but they're inactive right i'll tell you what exactly i'm just going to give you an example so if you select any of these diagnosis you click on move to past so you will get reasons so these are the reasons that are already in the system resolved ruled out uh inactive other so what they do is they keep inactive and it gets moved to the past but uh doesn't that cure md application does not have those diagnosis okay you do not have the application so we do have those diagnosis in the system but they moved to past and the reason was selected inactive that is why you are seeing uh that those uh our office has choosed it not you right that's correct okay the other thing is that okay if they put this for example if you look at the first diagnosis acute vagio with if they put it in the past right and make it inactive so this all thing is gonna go away the the one you know all that is uh so when whenever you click on it uh you have certain uh you know uh things in the comment section like this one creamy greens everything so whenever and move it into the past this whole uh documentation goes with it so you would not be able to see the documentation as well that that's how the system works yeah no i understand but when i go to the past i can see the diagnosis as an inactive right like for example uh just take the first one rash right so if i put i add any note congestion okay so what if i wrote down any note if it becomes inactive my note is gonna be disappeared it's gonna disappear in the past you know i can see the diagnosis in the past as an inactive right but what about the note that i associated with that what happened to that what i go down there with mass directors and my dates and all that let me see that as well doctor so i do understand right so if the whole thing you put it in like our office put it in the past and make it inactive what do you say that when you move it to the past all these comments are no longer there right that's what i'm asking you is this gonna happen because that's what happened what is happening either they are physically just deleting it or it's just happening because they're making it inactive i believe doctor that if you make it inactive yes i totally get your point doctor now so uh the thing is when you make it uh inactive uh i believe the comments gets deleted but i can certainly find that out for you as well because uh i'm not quite sure but that as far as i know this is very important to know it's very important to know because you know uh we need to know because this is happening for a long time and we need to know exactly who's doing it because we have told them several time not to do it and um this is a legal document and somebody's telling you you know your your employer is telling you not to do it so we need to know right who's doing it just give me one second doctor let me just test it out on my end as well yeah i tried to call you on friday because you know it's just very stressful um because you know this is going on for a while and i really want to know and every time i raise this issue i get the answer cure md does it all the time and for the last 10 years they are doing it they keep on deleting they put the things in the past and there's no we do not remove we are not allowed to remove any so so that's so that's the wrong statement you know this is a very big statement and this is the wrong statement so i want to know exactly if it's happening from our side so i need to know who's doing it and why they're doing it yeah that's why i need your help because this is what i'm hearing you know uh and i really don't and i really don't agree with that even i don't know cure md very well because it doesn't make sense you know why cure md would do that make things difficult for people you know they're there to help doctors give me 1 second because let me just uh let's just test it on a test patient because i believe there was some uh because we do not want to uh mess anything up with the live patient so let me go to a test patient and show you once we uh lets see no okay so let me go to a test patient so this will make a lot of sense so lets look at this patient go to their uh provider notes so lets say we create a new provider note so lets say this is the diagnosis that is already added in the system we click on it we add certain text to it right yeah this is yeah lets do that david and then now okay now its there you can see all the description as well and lets move this uh diagnosis into the past and see what happens and then make it inactive too you know because this is whats happening this is the one we click on it so no so typically somebodys deleting it so what i can think of is that uh you can still see all the comments section in the past but somebody uh what theyre doing is theyre moving the diagnosis as you said that there are three users that uses the doctors account correct yeah yeah the other practitioner and then if doctors say it is not doing it uh uh and and just so you know doctor we do not have we only have logs for uh the account but if somebody else is using the doctors account we cannot tell which one is doing it so that is so yeah i do understand yeah that we have to rule out because we know which people have his um passcode you know right so we just tested it out doctor uh you can see that um okay lets just check one more thing doctor and and then also this is not it because you know this is very clear that somebody physically like can you go and remove the two tests from here just the two of those can you just delete it for me like the same on the chronic pain syndromes remember you type test test test test yes yeah can you just remove the two tests instead of the whole thing okay not the whole thing just can you just dont know how to delete it yeah thats it so that means youre doing it right and if youre doing it by name nobody would know right but but then you can you save it can you um can you save it or go back i just wanted to show you something im just checking one thing just give me a minute doctor okay so there is if if it is an inactive um there is no way to save it thats another thing can you go to this yellow window because thats what i wanted to um i think you might know this yellow thing log yeah so it shows that uh but for hannah has done that i can i can delete that too right if you move them in the past uh i can bring it to the present and delete it and then put it back in the past you know and make it inactive and click on make current mhm that way and that way you should be able to see them in the current section and then i can save it right you can click save and then this will be safe right the way you want it to be if you want to remove uh half of the note or you want to remove my date so anybody whos doing it they can do it right uh they can do it uh what uh what needs to be done is that in the past section they are not able to remove those comments but if they put it in the current tab they can simply open it up and then make the changes so now if i delete these two tests and then you and then you put it back in the past its so easy now you take this now you can simply move you can make it inactive right so now now um nobody would know like in the past if you go to that window you will see the changes but but but this section doctor these are the actions that were taken place what im doing is im opening up that same judys account and lets see if we can find those logs just give me one minute yeah thank you so all the um uh doctor uh diagnosis that you move in the past uh you uh youre sure that there are some certain comments added in there um im sorry about judy youre talking about im talking about all the patients doctor so you see uh you have all the patients and there are certain comments in their diagnosis as well so uh youre uh you add all with all the diagnosis you add comments not not in all the diagnosis add comments but most of the diagnosis i do add the comments because theres always im doing something and id like to and even if i'm not doing something i will all i will always add that theyre on these medications their kidney functions are the the this for next time when i see the patient review the lab i can add the recent one there to compare so its good its its you know you can provide a better care to the patient because you know the healthcare providers they just dont write nothing and then they would just go over and they miss a lot of things and its not good for the patients it has to be thats why i started doing it okay so let me tell you one thing so did you see doctor that that all the comments that you add we are able to see them in here right yeah and it says but for hannah has done it thats that's correct because were doing it from your account can we check the judy heritage yeah im just checking i was checking it on my screen i needed to show you as well but the thing that really surprised me and judy heritage we cannot even see that particular diagnosis even in the past as an inactive remember the one i showed you in the documents the bronchitis this is um um that can we go back to the document and see exactly what was the icd code for that one was because mhm let me just show you one more thing doctor so you uh you go to past so this particular uh diagnosis was uh marked uh inactive and it was mark lets say so this one was marked inactive uh because that was like somebody did diagnosis changes here say provider note changes right so somebody puts something and they made some changes either to remove it if you click on it uh you are not able to see any comments because i believe this particular diagnosed was uh diagnosed was attached with the patient with no comments and uh uh there was no logs of the comments as well can you see yeah yeah i dont see it okay then lets see the one that we can see the log how about this this is uncomplicated oh oh that was the present yeah we are we are we are taking care of the past right now yeah so now if we can open that same file again doctor lets go into that document you want me to go uh if you can please take me there doctor yeah yeah of course because i oh i dont know why its not happening what happens we have to log in log out no thats okay you can just click on it again yeah thats what im trying to because you know when this happens sometimes i have to go to another patient it happens sometimes not a problem too you see how the pages so im gonna go to another give me a second doctor oh i think we took very long so i have to log in again so let me do it again oh i think i have to go back again and then do it oh i have to just go there documents yeah and then um it was the next page i believe doctor mohanty and then the diagnosis uh first so basically yeah so i have to go down to the diagnosis trying to see the same note that we use that there this is a note from doctor mohanty mind out okay its right here do you see it uh bronchiectasis with acute bronchitis j 47 point zero primary diagnosis so thats the one we dont see even the diagnosis we cannot see anywhere and also whats written there you know the comments the plan g 47 acute bronchitis but you know the c the bronchiectasis that acute bronchitis j 47 point oh but sometimes if you will go back you will see i have multiple diagnosis with the same thing bronchiectasis but its not the same one with acute bronchitis okay just give me 1 second okay whats the date written in here dcotor okay thats the date of birth yeah why didnt any idea the the date of the note this is the time when we send the referral so thats not the date i have to look at the diagnosis because i i write down the date thats the reason i write down to i know when i all the patients so to go back here so um the date is right here february 19 2020 and then february 25 2020 did you see the date at the end of the note this right here yes i can update february 19 and while we are here im just telling you that you know i have seen where people have deleted the date a lot of places i will show you even i will give you the examples and then some of the places i have seen that half of the note of deleted and some places i would see that the whole note is deleted only as directors are there that means there was something by then being deleted and they forgot to remove the directors alright uh just give me one second doctor im just going to close this for now so lets go to the patients uh provider notes again okay lets open february 19 so this was when uh you uh these are the screen shots from that particular day yeah go down to the diagnosis yeah so we need to go up up okay oh itself okay okay so its theyre here do you see here bronchiectasis yeah alright so it it was there before what happened then later on because it goes from note to note right it doesnt like stop it does it carries the the yeah so who removed it thats the question is there a way to do it if theres a way to do it then somebody has done it so i already talked to you youre telling me that cure md doesnt do this thing okay so somebody has done it right looking at it uh let me see doctor just give me a minute and there are multiple notes this is not it its just constantly happening cleaning up wiping up my note so it was uh acute bronchitis g 47 so let me take you to another um page and well have all the logs there just give me one second ill tell you you can do you have any answers so far im curious ill tell you uh where is it im going to show you another logs now im hoping nobody is doing it because if somebody is doing it its just very disturbing ill show you what exactly going on okay so these are the provider notes tab correct doctor yes so you can see all the provider notes in here im going to show you another tab where you can see the diagnosis can you click on clinical clinical yes i did and can you click on diagnosis right here yeah you can see all the diagnosis current and past that were attached and all the provider notes so if current and past right so uh this is the j- 47 this was attached at some stage right this one okay so we if we click on logs in here so now you can see what exactly went wrong here okay so it was inserted by you correct then it was updated by you updated by you updated by you till march 3rd you it was you who updated them or march seventh i believe and then may six it was updated by the doctor syed okay yeah it was still uh in uh current situation then whoever updated did the work on provider note not the diagnosed you see that the provider note that means what i wrote down that that was correct so its all provider note right then uh doctors market uh inactive on the diagnosis by going in here then uh the doctor syed's account but thats from his account somebody else is doing it my husband those three um users that uses doctors it was marked past and an inactive from this particular section then it was updated and put it to current that would we was thats what we were discussing earlier that it was um the comments were deleted or something like that and then it was marked to current uh state then from the provider note uh somebody updated with doctors account uh in the provider notes then again diagnosis was marked uh into past and marked inactive yeah uh with your account something was updated on april 28th yeah okay and uh past and inactive so these are the logs and the last one that was updated was by dina carmen mhm she updated something yeah so she did it on the provider note right so im trying to understand that is this a dinner carmen removed it are the one that syed mohammad's then removed it thats what im trying to understand who did it okay so the only logs we can uh because as you can see its its uh says updated so um lets see so but somebody has done it right somebody has removed it right right thats what im trying to get that updated obviously my take multi businesses so this was when it was first marked inactive correct okay um then this was again in 2020 it was marked inactive and then we only have the options of updated so updated does not mean that it was it was already in the past uh uh section yeah but then who removed the plans from there from the provider note and we are also not able to see it in the past section right yeah just like that and the limited system glitch i dont believe that system glitch is not gonna remove half of the note and remove that remove the dates only or you know its just not so in here uh it says j 47 i was able to see it somewhere this is j 47 and it says current but that was 47.0 and were not able to see it in the current tab yeah that is strange okay so that is strange just give me 1 second we were able to see it in the primary diagnosis out there g 47 bronchiectasis yeah but where is the rest of the the provider note where is that um remember i wrote down all that where is that it was g 47.0 right yeah thats correct yeah where are the comments thats what im trying to understand so let me go back and uh of course you know hopefully my husband doesnt need to call you about this because you already told me you know you talk to them and then we will see what it is uh but if he has to call you then of course you will tell him the same what youre telling me right if you have to walk into then you want me to talk to doctor syed okay so lets let's look into that so the that particular uh uh this particular uh diagnosis uh i believe this is where something happened so when it was marked inactive and then in march so thats when they removed it so it was definitely something uh related to doctor somebody whos using doctor muhammads account and at that date right right right so what you show these logs to doctor syed so that he can better understand uh what exactly is going on and from future uh the best thing to do is uh doctor you can maybe assign those three uh users different uh account so that you can uh you know see the logs as well because right now the doctor you mean like doctor you mean doctor syed because hes given away his password and he theres no way they cant they have to use it but we know who is using it so we will know who those people are so we can talk to them about it but there are three people right so um in this case in this case dina carmen is not the one who made the changes thats what im trying to i want to rule out thats not dina carmen so theres theres other so theres by the name of my husband two people using it so one made it inactive and then bring it to the current and then delete it and then make it again passed inactive right thats what happened thats what happened so you see the problem let me take a picture of that please just a second i'll just highlight this is where it was marked inactive and as we discussed earlier as well doctor we tested it out on a test patient so when you mark it inactive um the comment stays there but when you mark them active again and then move those comments and then you mark them inactive thats when you can make those changes yes i do understand completely so so basically you know um as a as a third person you know youre not you you feel that this is what happened right right so uh just so you know doctor and maybe you can um roll out this uh to the practice users as well that we are not allowed to make any changes because the data is really critical for the patients so we that is why we have test patients so we are happening in our office i need to find out you know um and then there are a lot of other patients so im just gonna focus on judy heritage i dont think so i need to give them explanation of other patients because you know my access records my dates are gone it just makes sense i can go back and look look it up so uh i will show you one more patient do you have the time just after i already have a scheduled session at 10 but yes go ahead i'll yeah yeah no no no it's okay so so so i mean i can tell my husband about it but im like its the same thing going on with other things you know they can change the date they can change anything they want right right so doctor we have logs for every single click in the system okay so um i showed you how you can see those logs you can simply go to clinical and diagnosis see all the diagnosis ever attached with the station and then you can see those changes so yeah and the doctor syed has to talk to you you can please tell him like just exactly you told me yes i can i certainly can doctor so uh we will make an appointment with you i know youre busy uh you can just uh do you want it today after uh no i dont think so today um uh i dont think so i will ask him but we will we will call you and well ask you will leave a message for you okay so lets lets do one thing doctor what we can do is um uh you can write down my number uh or i can give you my email address you can send me an email um is there i can type in yeah you can tell me your email okay so its evan e v a n mhm dot use h u g h e s at dot com because sometimes im in a session or im on another line but if you send me an dont worry yes exactly i can give you a call straight away once i receive your email yes yes definitely and and then uh so so basically cure md has not done anything they have they dont you you dont do inactive you dont make the diagnosis to change it to inactive so what do you do basically for us uh we fix your problems so uh okay so basically i am getting the impression you are creating problems for the system which is so wrong because people are doing it in the office and theyre trying to hide it thats it so these are something this is something that uh somebody from your office theyre making some changes to it uh we test uh whenever we do any changes or if we need to see what exactly is going on we always do it on a test patient we never open up a live patient because we are not allowed uh you know and um theres definitely using doctor muhammads account theyre making those changes okay evan so im gonna go ahead and talk to them and then if you have to reach you back again so please keep in mind all those points okay i really really appreciate your time thank you so much for solving this problem no worries doctor we are always here to help you so what ill do is ill make a note of it ill uh you know save your number as well in case i need to get in touch with you again and uh for now i will close the ticket with all the comments that we just discussed doctor and uh dont worry about that just one more thing just one more thing please im sorry just one more thing is like uh if cure md is not doing it if i in our office um if nobody takes the action you know they dont fire the person whos doing it or whatever so can i uh is there a way i can bring the audit to the office where they can go over and you know say that this is this has been illegal illegal im not certain that we have the diagnosis report but lets see let me have a look but the audit can i call the audit like somebody can come and audit for us yeah i dont know from where from cure m d yeah i dont know from where from cure md from anywhere like audit like for example if i'm working for um x y z employer and this is happening with my notes right and and the system like like the cure m d tells me theyre not doing it and my employer is not taking any actions so what should i do if my employer is not doing it who should i tell that this is happening with the patient note how can i bring the audit um that is actually the doctor not my domain uh i believe there is uh no i do not uh maybe okay and one more thing doctor if you need to discuss this with the relevant team maybe you log the ticket that you need to talk to the audit team and the that particular ticket will be assigned to the relevant team and they would be able to help you out with that because i uh i can yes because as i can think of things um if you talk about audit even in the audit report uh the login details would be for doctor syed um i understand because the name will come up the same as we just discussed so the best doctor syed should use only his account and other staff members they can be assigned a new account so next time it happens uh we can see the logs and we can certainly find out who exactly made those changes okay i got you thank you so much for your time i'll just go ahead and close the ticket for now but uh you can uh keep me in the loop and if you want me to i can certainly do that i appreciate it evan thank you so much"}}, {"id": 74, "data": {"call_id": "1622569785.1211045.txt", "text": "hello hi martina this is evan from CureMD how are you good how are you i'm good thank you uh martina actually i'm

good good how are you i'm good as well i was calling in regarding the ticket you put in today yeah i was wondering if there's a way that you can give me a call tomorrow morning i'm finishing up the day now okay sure uh but uh i think there are only two questions you had right one for changing the provider's name second for just knowing what other people can see more than 10 in the hot list well the second question is pretty easy it's uh the hot list is under your preferences so you just have to go into the home page under your preferences and from there you can change the number on your hot list so every user has to do with themselves it's not something you know that can be changed settings so you just go into preferences and under preferences for general you get to you know just 10 50 100 how many you want okay perfect other than that the name that you mentioned for khudija badoosi um is it the user name or the provider profile that you're referring to i don't know so when patients are getting text messages they're getting the incorrect spelling so i don't know where the text message pulls the name from but that's where it's incorrect okay for the text message alright uh alright kel kel idea okay can pronounce that one but yeah the spelling you gave me um yeah that's the one here is that k uh that's k l e j d j a right yep and b e r d u f i what are the patients getting um i i i can't answer that i just know the patients that your names are wrong because it's all up to the provider it's all caps that's the only thing that i can think of other than that i can you know make it not all caps so you know it might be something that they're saying let me just update it and uh yeah you can let me know if there's you know still anything because as i'm seeing it quick uh yep that's the correct name alright i'll just update it to uh just basically make it uh you know lower case letters instead of all caps and hopefully that should fix the issue now if any patient you know complaints further please let me know if you could you know just get the patient to send over a screenshot of whatever he's getting that would be helpful in us you know being able to update it okay

patients are getting the text messages but not for not for those types like clinical alerts and follow up visits you got birthdays you got well somewhere failed but somewhere passing if you go here sent so okay so there are for labs you get for birthday you get for a bunch of stuff but just not for alerts like clinical alerts or follow up alerts those two i haven't seen any text maybe it's because i'm not using them right so how would i use it that a patient could get a notification maybe to tell them hey it's time to come back for your pap smear it's time to come back to have your annual physical exam like could i use it for that yes talk to just give me one minute okay so follow up is basically uh doctor when uh you uh schedule a follow up appointment for that patient only then they receive a follow up um alert and other than that the clinical reminders give me 1 second clinical reminders are not set yet as you can see let me show you so clinical reminders are not set yet uh doctor is that okay if i can give you a call shortly i just need to confirm about the follow up and clinical alerts i just need to do a certain um research on my end is that okay if i can get uh again let it go ahead you can call me back later okay perfect perfect i'll do that doctor thank you for your time thank you thank you"}}, {"id": 81, "data": {"call_id": "1621879590.1029696.txt",

anydesk session so i can uh view your screen sure sure give me a moment okay okay yeah me too let me um get back to anydesk let me know once you have the nine digit number right oh okay dokey now

get this call this out you still there i'm here okay now let me do this i need to get you to so you can get a good situation okay the lot can a has field if the balancing error that says k i l i can't do not have wait a minute since i have this are you in i am here okay because let's let's back up off the c o b because i have this screen here for the um for the second issue let's make this if it's okay with you let's make the second issue the first issue which is this okay let me go that's right here what does that mean because the reason why this is important is because what happened is i i've been calling because i'm new to the system and new to the doctor really working with them and there's a number of of clients she filed over various last year really that she didn't get paid for they didn't get they didn't fall into the rejection bucket she just did not get paid and i was going through them and i looked at this of common error okay and and and and then and and and this claim wasn't paid but this is just one of many that's exactly like the okay so two things um uh first of all the claims response is book it i wouldn't recommend uh you to actually work off of this bucket because um are clearing house what they do is they work in this bucket so all the rejections that are received by a clearing house they actually convert those in easy to read language and then they throw any claims that are rejected they throw them into the rejected bucket any claims that are processed are actually sent to the submitted bucket so i wouldn't recommend going to the claims responses because uh this is not a place where we recommend practice to work off of this is specifically for a clearing house so for this claim right here um this wasn't accepted claim however it it probably did not get paid in a form of an era or eob were you not able to get uh get ahold of an eob or era for this claim no right it didn't get and it's just like i said this one of money which is the reason why i ended up just going through and trying to figure out what was going on it didn't get paid process and was rejected and it didn't get paid right uh that happens sometimes that the claim gets stuck in between you're not getting a rejection it's accepted um and it's not being paid so give me one moment uh let me actually grab the claim identifier for this claim and i'll check if the claim was uh by any chance if there's an era in existence and i'll also check if you're receiving era from health partners so give me a moment okay okay okay so you are receiving era from health partners that you can see here um it says health partners so so let's see if there's an era by any chance for this claim well see ok ok so see what happened is there was an issue with health partners i don't know do you all of your uh tickets in terms of uh resolution but they there was a problem and she she said she had um talked to help and um that was corrected so i talked to someone and they said they were gonna good health partners backed out there is something i didn't quite understand what was happening and to go ahead and leave just go one by one at least submit the um the kind okay i'll wait till you get what you're doing go ahead i am listening but so but if you look at jackson for instance she's got a whole bunch of and they're not arrived but i mean it's it's quite a few health partner um uh she was says allowed zero and that would mean i would have to go to all the even though it's the the status is filed you can see it wasn't paid so in order to get that paid do i have to go back and we file all those and you can see quite a few like that you can mac see oh right there right there right there oh see that red and red that would be the original c o b error as um i was getting some of these claims with the balancing issue cob will be back balancing issue so we fell into the second issue just by looking through the first issue how do you balance it are you guys submitting claims uh multiple dates of services for one station under under one data service okay not normally what happens with because all i work with the remote um claims for remote services and and they take care of the billing for the clinical doing in the office normally i make sure that when i'm posting a uh when i'm putting in a claim that falls on the same day as a clinical claim i changed the uh the date because i have flexibility and as long as the remote posted they generally take it the company pay within a month that's the 30 days of pipeline so the date of service can be any days within that 30 days so normally know the answer to that would be no but there are some claims where you would have uh right on the remote the data services arrange it like could be arranged from 0714 and the 0314 the 0328 beginning and end date of service because because you can only um get paid for the (994 587 58 4598458 if if there's a 99457 on the record so okay that that's not a problem you can actually submit claims uh for multiple days on the same uh charge so that's not an issue uh but uh the problem with era is that you cannot post it because it's out of balance but the claim did not get paid and actually got denied let me also show you as well the reason for the denial uh okay this right here uh this is a claim did not get paid it was for $95 and they actually denied the claim on the basis of c 0 216 and um they're giving this reason if this reason does not make further sense to get a more elaborate response from the insurance you may need to call health partners directly to uh get a response that's why they did not pay the claim okay wait how did you get this is so you went to okay so you went to remember okay you just put the claim number in correct i actually looked up um let me show you if you go to advance search okay here it will tell you like from which insurances like any insurance that will send you an era their name will appear here so so far uh in your application you have actually received era from erp aetna cigna so on and so forth so by looking at health partners we at least know that you're receiving eras in the application but then comes the next point right if you're being paid for them so if you click on health partners it's already highlighted click on it right question though i know there was a problem that i find this before and it was corrected and the the the point being is the but the crime is still out there even though it wasn't paid so do i have to resubmit all those claims because i talked to someone somewhere in curemd and they said they were gonna correct whatever was happening okay okay okay give me a second okay i don't even know if it was a ticket i don't even i don't know if i put a ticket up for that wait a minute and i might have an email or a message just see what's happening here paula is this the ticket i believe this may be it yeah what did i say right that's just it okay so basically initiated era enrollment so uh era enrollment is just the fact of receiving receipts for payments so if you're getting uh explanation of benefits on paper um enrolling yourself for health partners will make sure that you're receiving eras in the application that's a separate story but if you're not getting paid it depends on on which end the claim is on right now like let's suppose that the claim is rejected the example that that you just showed me at the start of the call that was an accepted claim but there's no record for the era reason that we initiated the enrollment not too long ago because health partner takes around uh 25 to 30 business days for the enrollment to be completed i believe it is completed because we're receiving the errors in the application but we do not have past records eras because they were coming under paper eobs so the claim that you uh showed me at the start of the call it was accepted but there may be a paper eob somewhere explaining that whether this claim that paid or not if you do not have access to that eob then you will have to contact health partners directly i would not recommend resubmitting that claim because it's an accepted claim you do not know what happened to that claim and until you do you cannot resubmit that claim because if you resubmit the claim as it is it can be denied again as a duplicate it could be denied again due to another reason so that's why i would recommend calling the health department uh health partners on that claim only uh at least uh for starters okay but okay so the question is i have that there are a lot of there are a lot of claims health partner claims that will fall into this category so i do have contact with the gentleman and health partners and he wants so what i'll do is i will get together a list of the name of people that that that where this is a problem because i was told uh i'm sorry go ahead i was told just to resubmit the claim and the doctor called me today and she was trying to resubmit some claims and it wouldn't leave a blank screen back so because if everybody's with health partners that generated a report i'm gonna have to just send them a name i'll send them all his name so you say that has been corrected in the system um let me have a look eras are coming in so you should be receiving received for health partners okay going forward uh but the claims are being submitted correctly give me a moment okay okay okay so your claims were actually going under the doctors npi as you can see but i believe claims under the billing group npi so there it is okay okay so there's two ways um you won't have to do that much effort in going over every single claim uh just pick up one claim that was impacted by this error message like it was submitted under the doctors npi but it was supposed to go under the uh billing group npi npi now there's two things here if the claims excuse me can you repeat that it was submitted under the doctors under the doctors uh correcting this problem uh if it affected several claims simply uh take one claim as an example and you need to check how what happened to that claim the first claim went under the doctors npi and then you resubmitted the claim under the individual under the doctor's group npi which is their practice npi okay normally resubmitting the claim fixes the problem and you receive a payment for that uh let me also answer that for you as well to see if there's an era for this claim that we resubmitted i'm pretty sure we won't because we did not have the era enrollment in place that's why we may not have the ra uh in the system right now so give me a moment okay so there's no record uh in the application okay so i would recommend this uh because uh because there was no enrollment for health partners so we were not uh being informed at least inform of an e r a what is happening with the claim so you should have received payment but i have a feeling that the claims that were submitted under the doctor's name they might have been denied because if the claim was originally denied you would have to resubmit the claim with the replacement number and the replacement number can only be obtained from the era right so okay now let me ask you this why would it be resubmitted the first submitted the first time with the group with the doctors npi and the second time under the group npi what happened in the system that changed this could it be that she could it be could it be that she has a post office but she has a post office box whatever it is and then her name oh as the provider and then there was some confusion in the um in the system as to which 1 to pick um let me check when the first claim went out for health partners because that always help and it's been okay because maybe we can get rid of that she was talking to me the other day about trying to eliminate the post office cool i guess that's the location that's what you all have because the system would have picked up is the number one so what's in the system that allows it the first go around to pick up the doctors npi and then the second um time pick up the group and npi well every single insurance has uh a billing group set up behind it so if that billing group set up is not in the application if you i'll also show that to you as well if you go to the practice settings and you go to provider and you can see that you guys have multiple health partners uh profiles added uh keep in mind you can add health partners even 10 times in the application but the pair id will remain the same for all 10 so it is preferable to have only a single insurance of course we can or delete insurances once they are added and they're attached to uh patient profiles uh because there's a reference in place uh but just for future reference try not to add uh an insurance more than once uh so if we come under billing provider this is where all the set up starting place and if there's no billing up here then the claim is not being submitted under the right npi so i think this is the reason did you guys by any chance change the way you guys bill i knew i'm i'm sure they did because i've only been working on it a couple of months couple three months maybe because i was working on something else and i had that because of what i had to learn i'm learning the system but i'm sure they changed it because it looks like it's too many health partners so i had to call her and ask him what health partners that are you using you know and and i have a feeling you probably go out there and do do an audit or something probably two or three claims and claims under several different health partners because the people that she had in the office you you know when you're working with the system is not just not knowing it is knowing the right questions to ask in order to resolve your issue and most of them don't didn't have any kind of uh and it makes a computer experience or anything so they need they called you they wouldn't even know what to ask but anyway you have to answer your question is yeah they did they changed okay can you check with them from what i can what i can see quite a few times so the issue is why did they pick up the first the npi for the doctor the first time and then put up the group npi and is there a group npi on here i don't know that that would be her and she asked me about getting rid of the post office 9959 the other day oh the location okay so there's no good npi here not i'm sorry that's the doctors npi right the group npi field was blank try to post office and see if there's something in that field because she had the same times with health partners i mean what's the name vip keystone vip no i don't think it's a problem with the npi npis seems to be okay uh all the claims are going under the doctor's name so what i would recommend is uh because there is no era enrollment in place and we recently got the era enrollment completed so any claims you submit for health partners you will receive the era uh the explanation of the payment or the denial in the application but anything that was submitted in the past that eras were not coming in so even if your claims were being accepted uh where the papers eobs are going uh i'm not sure if they're coming at the right location maybe that might be the problem uh but you need to you can use this claim as an example maybe because actually this was paid i'm not sure if this was paid by keystone or who this was paid by keystone this is health partners see you got health partners pa and then you have health partners but you say it's keeping the same code so wouldn't make any difference with the name was right um that depends i'll check the profiles to see if the pair ids are the same this is paid by uh health partners okay it's got the same payer id regardless of the name right know the payer id for health partners and the health part is p a is the same same number right is the same number so that's okay if it's doing a search by i pay id instead of the name okay okay so um i believe so i'm sorry go ahead where we're at the point where you're saying that anything that they anything that was built the health partners prior to be being updated in the system it's just out there right right no no what i meant was any claims that went out prior to the enrollment being completed uh there will be no record of the eras in the system because the enrollment was not present so there may be a possibility that just like the example that we saw at the start of the call uh that the claim is accepted but there's no correspondence because most of the time uh to resubmit a claim we need a claim reference number because it goes as a replacement so we need that replacement number is either as an icm number or a pcn number so that cannot be obtained without having an era on file so if there's a claim that has no payment information uh you may be able to get that from the insurance um if it if it never came to curemd maybe they might have an online portal if that's a possibility to obtain uh previous checks well yeah because what's happening is you you you told me don't look at the outstanding what was where was i at the beginning you said that don't look at that that's kinda confusing claims response you said i'll look at the claim response but i do not look at the claim response uh you can actually check under um submitted or maybe go to the patient's profile because if you use that claim identifier and go to the payment section of the claim um you will get the same information because claims response if you submit a claim five times the most accurate response would be in the fifth submission it will not be in the third submission so when you look at claims response is you might uh claim responses you might be looking at the second or the third you may not be looking at the most recent response to try not to use this area you can actually look for a claim even in here as well on the right hand side if you paste the claim identifier you'll be able to tell because any claims that are rejected would be in your rejected bucket okay and then i picked that up is that these claims and they're quite a few of them across several patients all the health patients rejected bucket for a moment i wanna see if there's any health partners claims in there go to process on the last uh go to the process section on the left hand side okay process process yeah right above problem list on the left hand side uh declined process i'm sorry okay yeah see what i'm saying yeah mm mm mm mm okay so can you click on that error on the top right corner the double arrow facing right next to group by on the right hand side now that things i can't below that there's an arrow double double arrow on the right hand side yeah that's what you know i called one time asked how come we can't i can't drink this out the rejection i mean yeah that's that's one of the problems that like you can extract a report but the reasons are not in the report yeah it is because i i because i yeah come but if you'll notice most of those claims on there we don't see um health partners and i have a bunch of help i have a bunch of help i'm sorry what i'll do is i'm going to go to advanced search actually you guys have several different health partners but they'll be difficult to narrow them all down so yeah but the same but they they should have the same uh id number i'll tell you what prevailed to jackson and then you can find cause velda jackson is who we were working on with the with the with the uh not being paid the problem is they're not falling into the rejected a field bucket a file a table um but they aren't being paid so she was under the impression that she had all these uh claims filed and she was wondering what was happening with the money but they were filed but according to um question is why what they're being paid that's the only thing we're trying to figure out okay so the timely filing for health partners is only 90 days uh but since the claim has been submitted now some of the claims are coming in the rejected bucket there being rejected for a reference number just like i mentioned uh because you guys did not receive the eras in the application you guys did not know what was happening with the claim you guys are not getting payment that's for sure some claims that get paid but not all of them so the claims that are not being paid their most likely denied every denial hasn't have either an eob or era in place so without the eob or era you won't have the icm number or the pcm number which is needed to resubmit the claim as a replacement because if you resubmit the claim as it is is going to reject again so the claim that we saw right at the beginning that was accepted uh you will have to check with the insurance what happened to that you need to also ask the insurance if they can provide you the eob copies for all the claims that have been submitted prior to a certain date all the eobs prior to a certain date right uh preferably prior to um i would say um april 2020 and prior so the month of april and all prior to that okay most probably health partners may have a portal online uh you may be able to get the eobs and uh do you know how to pull up a report for health partners all the claims for health partners that may be outstanding uh all the clients and all the patients patients no show me okay one year at a time um you may have to play with excel a little bit so just go after one year i will start off with um a year of um 20 2021 okay so if you go into miscellaneous there's a report billing summary okay i've never used that one which one do you normally use no i don't normally use that one under miscellaneous i generally do the charges payment details yeah that that's probably the most details but the problem with this report is that um it won't like it does give you the details the payment side of the report will not show you any charges that that have no payment attached and the charges are they're not show you any uh information of claims that uh have a payment attached so it's kind of incomplete uh billing summary would actually show you anything that is outstanding and it will also show you when it was last submitted and the outstanding balance so there's not there's not a lot of details that you have to shuffle through so if we run billing summary you just have to filter out the plans and let me show you uh real quickly okay i get it i'm going to run a date of service from six till 5th of 2020 keep in mind that the timely filing for the claims is 90 days right that's what i need to get this cleared up before i continue because it's quite they're quite and before we talk to our partners because there's quite a few claims out there cross the quite number of patients okay alright so once this report is pulled up uh just download an excel i yeah and and okay go ahead because that's exactly what i would do okay and then this order for health partners because i see signals and then okay are you allowed to eliminate that oh here i got it i got it i got it let me do this because they're also multiple for health partners so you'll have to select all the health partners uh there should be a line at the bottom of of the report can you delete that as well that's causing the cells to be uh too horizontal although at the end of the report there's a line that you need to delete oh okay at the very bottom of the report ohhh page down now what is this report have it the difference in the the one i've been using normally it has the the i notice uh one i've been using money what you're saying it doesn't show the chuck this one right here you hear that yeah okay and just reorganize the road just uh may i have control for a moment pardon uh give me a moment okay well you wanna sort it yeah give me a moment okay is keystone also under the same pair id no it should be okay i don't know i have to look i don't know what i have to look the keystone was a whole another issue it wasn't paying but i understand that because the address was line when when it was processed where the heads i am just moving it into a different uh this is showing you this is actually showing you um information by cpt okay and um this is showing you that no payments have been posted in the application so far these are the outstanding balances for all of these cpt codes you can see the dollar amount is around 24,000 that's only for a year and this is a charge amount now i'm not sure how much you guys get paid on a specific cpt code uh but this will also show you when the last submission date was some claims you can see that were submitted in 2020 um actually the majority of the claims are submitted in 2020 um data service you can see as well but this will tell you when the claim was last submitted so it's a claim um was submitted in 2020 and it was also uh it's also a date of service from 2020 and there's no payment then you have a problem let me ask you this question okay what what can you do a sub total about can you break it up but can i do something right quick and we can uh let me do this um i wanna do by patient doing patience yeah patient and then i want to count and then i'll just do this uh-huh that's not working but it is i'm control the i have an idea okay yeah it was working first so sorted um there's an easier way if we um create a pivot just throw the patient's name here you have all the patients and uh if you throw the uh plan balance under value this is all the dollar amount per patient okay the reason why i use the control the sort is because of the as a control for me by patients so so i can see what's happening but this is cool i can use the payroll for this too okay if you um if you add the data service as well it will further break it down by data service by patient but this actually education has the highest balance so i would recommend just um i think if there is a problem with getting these claims paid uh the root causes that problem will be maybe one or two so you just need to follow up with only two claims and you'll you'll be able to figure it out because i think majority of your claims were denied or some of the claims or half of the claims are denied but no one resubmitted the claims in the right way because you need to resubmit the claim as a replacement if you go to the charge pay there's a replacement uh replacement category i know how to do ok okay what happened with that okay what what happened with that is when i first started um i had a question about that but i found about the medicare does not accept rejects replacement clients so all this cause this is a remote this remote thing that i'm dealing with it's um strictly medicare okay medicare is one of the points and they and they reject replacement claims it has to be original so i because i didn't submit i did follow instructions when i called about and i put the finally replacement the reference code and everything and change it to be projected and then i started figured out why it's because medicare is gonna fall through health partners of vip whatever and and medicare's gonna pay and they do not like um replacement claim so there has to be original the last person i talked to said well make sure all your all your claims are submitted as original and they've been going through it's just like this is what we're talking about is uh just a particular thing with health partners okay um so with those claims the ones where there is no era or eob i would recommend trying to get a a copy of eob from the insurance that will ask you uh the right way of what happened to that claim i got you because basically when she's going through trying to um because she she does a clinical building and she and she was told too just to rebuild for health partners and she called me yesterday and said well it's not it's not doing anything it's not allowing me to file a claim it's just not doing anything so i said i figured we have to figure out what's going on and then too cause she shouldn't be what you're saying she shouldn't be going through and just be building all those file claims that weren't paid it's just gonna bounce right back anything before what did you say before april 20 is gonna bounce back and she we filed it right okay is that what you said so she shouldn't be going into yeah so she shouldn't be going and trying to rebuild basically nah that's taken care of now what about our cob issues balancing issues uh let me just have a look when the uh this one thing okay before we get to the cob i'm sorry go ahead i just try to pull up the name okay go ahead just give me one moment you're okay what time is it um can you look for health partners i'm having some uh typing problems you wanna be typing health partners with you me too what's going on okay perfect gets hung up like this mm put partners in there i'm just gonna say how much they paid by the health partners yeah i'm just trying to see when the era starting coming in okay see that's gotta be lunch okay that's keystone yeah that's all keystone we're trying to look at keystone health keeps coming in so it was once they made uh 19th of april and prior you will need to look for you will be okay yeah i see i see it it's only one here right uh i wanna see if keystone i don't think keystone share the same pair id when we send claims when era is coming they coming through the same route okay uh can we can you type keystone same problem with the keyboard okay which one which sheet they are under vip they are under keystone vip okay that's at the bottom okay okay so that's the so many that's okay okay come through the same route but health partners eras started coming in because enrollment got approved so anything uh prior to the 19th april you'll need to get records of eobs because only then you'll be able to tell what happened to some claims that were not paid because the explanation of benefits will be able to give you a better explanation uh try to get an online portal because even though we got um the enrollment completed we don't have the prior records so if they have an online portal you may be able to access any paper eobs that are not in curemd okay got you okay regards to what's happening today though if she's not she should be able to put in okay she should be able to you know she should be able to file from now on right by getting eob for health partners to the system okay correct okay next issue would be but you know what would be the cob error but that came up when we were looking at at health partners and what you're basically saying that error probably crops up because somebody's trying could be li cause she told me to do it to refile the um those outstanding claims that were not paid so we got one person here let me see i have it written down the error is out of balance okay take me to that patient yeah i'm looking at it now i'm trying to find the name i wrote it down let me let me bob to this uh excel spreadsheet quick okay here it is jeanette harris okay that would be one because that would be one patient with the cob at here in that hand hello i'm here do you want me to put yeah if you can all you got it account number 3133 right account number is 3133 what what account number jeanette harris this is the account in the in the ticket oh in the ticket i don't know i have to look at it the trick to come and see the house part and she's another another one that's right into what we've been working on if you look there you see the file file file file if you want the none of them went through nothing will pay okay and that's a health partners none of these claims to pay all the way back to october and they did not fall into the rejected bucket they just want to pay so when i get online with health partners i'll just have to figure out what happened there okay so i'll explain why that uh that error message comes up i think it may happen with this claim because uh medicare is a secondary insurance healthcare primary so we have the responsible plan set to um medicare right so there's no payment posted partners at the moment so i think we will come across an error message okay so what happens is you're not able to submit the claim due to two reasons if you have not posted your payment correctly let's suppose i received a payment from the primary insurance i did not transfer the amount to the secondary uh properly the line without a balance uh that is one reason when the claim will give you this message the second is where you're trying to submit the claim to the secondary or maybe even tertiary insurance but you have not met the prerequisite of sending that claim so in this appointment cases that there's a missing payment for health partners it won't let you submit a claim to medicare until or unless you post the payment for health partners you can even post a dummy payment and transfer the entire amount to medicare and submit the claim but the system will not let you submit the claim until the payment is posted uh the system will also not let you if you have not settled all the lines so if there's five cpt codes health partners paid you for for uh paid you for four of them the fifth one was denied you cannot submit the claim to medicare until or unless you resubmit the claim for health partners for that cpt code uh you write it off transfer the balance only then you can resubmit okay well how you gonna resubmit if um if it won't let you resubmit that's the thing in this case we cannot resubmit to medicare because it's still pending at health partners so it is incorrect to send a claim to medicare so i have to change the second the responsible insurance back to partner correct make sure make sure because because there's i have quite a few of these to make sure that the responsible claim and health partners on the right off situation what i do is just go in and change the uh but i don't like nothing let me ask you about about the posting when when when on the posting okay well that's what the problem is this this this claim like some health partners they weren't paid so she went through and posted them even though they felt into the pending posting and she went through and posted and then what happened they werent paid uh that's the thing uh claims were submitted no payments came in like uh when i said no payments came in i mean no eras came into the system so no one posted those payments so we were trying to submit the claim to the secondary insurance which cannot be done because payments are not posted payments are not posted because we don't have records for the eobs because enrollment just got completed for health partners uh just a few weeks ago so the question being a question is that she went through that screen and thought she was posting them she was allowed to post what was happening um that can't comment on i'm not sure i think she might just responsible plan is technically the the insurance or the party to whom you are trying to send the claim to and also responsible plan is also that plan under whom the responsibility currently lies under so if we haven't been paid fully by health partners and if there's something pending and health partners we cannot change the responsible plan to the next one you can only do that if you post the payment by transferring the balance to the next person in line whether that's the insurance for the patient you can write it off or you can post the payment there's only three things that you can do okay so what you wanna do is right off the full amount for decline uh no that's not what i'm saying uh let me show you the um payment side of this uh of this uh appointment you will see that there's no payment there's no payment for for mm but the responsible plans with medicare if we change the responsible plan back to health partners you'll be able to send the claim file out but the claim file will be going out to health partners and that'll be fine okay so the thing so within this particular claim then just go in and change it on the post payments change the payment when you change it here or back in the client on your claim the charge page if you go to charges uh response bottom right hand you will have to change that but that doesn't happen all the time i don't know how how okay okay well i got the general just what you're saying is to make sure the payment plan is is the is the primary plan in this case in this case of these the responsible because and this and these are remote billings everything should be the primary um insurance company because they're all gonna be medicare because medicare is the only one doing the paying on the company doing this remote situation can we go back and pick a nine can you go back to the previous page and pick a non medicare primary uh because the same thing was happening her in her clinical and her clinical payments when she when she paid what she generates claims to the primary so we put velda jackson in she would be a good yeah she would be a good um and look at yeah look at the charges okay she's only health partners oh she is alright these are these are the problems these are the health problems with help finding problems yeah okay see right okay so this one is 421 for 19 i think that was paid that yeah that's that's what i thought that was pretty it's it's just because what happened with that that i you know some of them they took out they deducted the uh yeah well see she's that you see all these file 3 10 when they weren't paid but that's because health partners just got situated in the system right because see our those 115 and 125 i can look at those those are clinical a claim that she found the doctor file because okay right here for some reason your system doesn't take 299458 was that paid 299458 99458 right here at this now where they it wasn't paid that was not paid and see legally she can build a 992 for 299458 in the same period and the same 30 day period but for some reason the system kicks it out but let's not deal with that right now that's not major i wanted to make sure instead wouldn't that solve the problem pardon uh why not build this out as uh okay they're building they're two different dates okay uh the data services are different and the reason for that is because this whole remote thing it's for a 30 day period and when some of the insurance companies are bill i mean some of the remote providers are just billing at the billing at the end of the month they're billing everything like on 4 30 they're gonna bill all the five sevens and all the 58 and 54 at the end of the month i know they're having problems with other um billing packages because it's not it wasn't it wasn't accepting it because of the date you see here the date is 304324 that's because in one month area and i hope area you can bill for 5 7 and 258 and that's it cause cause uh cause this is one session and this these are each 20 minutes so you can get 60 minute total all three the 6o minutes total and a 30 month period at 30 day period i think that was that paid no uh no it wasn't paid so uh to resubmit the claim because this was denied uh you'll have to get this ipn number if you would like to resubmit this is the ipn number you can also get the era as well so you can check with the insurance why they're denying the claim because it shouldn't be this should be paid yeah i know so i'm going to go uh i will contact them tomorrow i'm gonna contact the doctor told her to sign up for him i'm gonna get a link be uh if we put this uh cpt code like it's 12 and 24 what put it maybe we can put it as a range uh down below as well and put it as two units maybe that would work but then that wouldn't make sense because that would mean uh 10 days actually 12 days so that would make sense never mind so insurance would actually tell you how can this claim be paid uh so let's see so anyways um the uh the balancing issue just keep in mind that whoever you're sending the claim out to or whoever the responsibility is currently under should be the responsible plan so if i'm not done with health partners yet like in this case if i change the responsible plan to the next insurance i will start receiving uh balancing issues you will start seeing this claim and the clean bucket where it will be in pink because we're not done with this claim that has been denied so just keep in mind that anything that is out of balance is due to three reasons you're trying to send a claim to uh the next responsible plan then it should not be like you're missing payments for the primary insurance you have posted the payment uh incorrectly or there's a denial involved so these three reasons but the root causes the same it's all payments related you cannot move on until you have settled uh something under the current plan if that makes sense i hope i'm not too confusing i think about it go through it tomorrow i'm not clear on it but then i was before i went out knowledge base and pulled up out of there was a cob error and it said something about writing right off the amount and uh you're not supposed to write it off uh my point was that like let's suppose we can use this as an example health partners if we had a medicare insurance does the patient as a secondary term can you check i think they only had health partners so hypothetically if the patient had medicare and if i changed the responsible plan to medicare you will not be able to submit the claim you will get an error message because the claim is denied so to move forward uh in order to submit the claim to the secondary insurance you would either have to post the payment which would involve resubmitting the claim to have health partners or if you feel that health partners will not pay you you can transfer the balance to the next next insurance in line or you can write it off if you feel that no insurances will pay so what you're saying is when she went out because she has her own billing for clinical and when she went out and um just posted a whole bunch of uh out the outside what she did was we went to outstanding balance and when you go to outstanding balance you know it's listed a bunch of out there and she just went through so let me post this let me post this let me post it but if it was it was back then before april you don't know what happens when she closed the health partners what happens to the system it probably just goes out and we um and you can resubmit the climbing it's blocked right back because it's not being but the problem i was is not being bounced back is rejected it's just not being paid that's the question so now i understand what to do with the health partners and find out why they didn't pay like this it's a claim claim if you ask me right the claim was submitted correctly so i'm not sure why they're denying it so i will have to find out well i hope i didn't have a whole job too much i don't think i'll be calling much anymore because they will finally think i have been able to get around call and you can put a support ticket at any time do not do not discourage yourself i'm calling uh have a question any time let us know go here to help okay okay but you can see why i was confused by this boy i'm telling you okay so i'm fine now i'll go through with tomorrow the resolution is with health partners is to get into the system and find out what happened in april because she has a lot of so does that sound right to you okay just trying to i'm sure it will take you to the right direction because right now you don't even know if some of the claims are being paid or denied okay yeah because not getting before april because it's not updating it basically what you're saying is with regards to health partners and maybe some of the other ones that i have that i go through um because she has a problem ethna with this um where they were sending the paper checks prior to april 15 for health partners okay and uh uh i'll i'll i'll be marking this ticket as resolved if you have any additional issues just put in the ticket at any time in representative will give you a call or if you're not available i know you work after 1 o clock i called uh before as well wasn't able to get a hold of you so if we cannot get a hold of you do give us a call back at any time okay yeah no problem okay have a nice evening thank you very helpful yeah you were very helpful thank you bye bye mhm"}}, {"id": 83, "data": {"call_id": "1621867417.1023364.txt", "text": "pediatrics how can i help

it possible for you to have a quick screen session with me so we can be on the same page yes okay is it still there anything any desk mhm okay the number on here is 408 721 459 i'm sorry uh can we can you please repeat the number i think your voice is breaking up a little bit i'm sorry 408 721459 okay right i can see the screen great so we're trying to change the clinical letter template okay yeah so we want to change one of these um another strange thing that happens with these letters is we it's in 10 point right now but then we sign it and then we come back to it and it actually changes and now date so when i sign it and print it it comes out tiny so oh i don't know why i don't know why but we have let's see i have another which is ah have sort of an example of a letter that i we had wanted it to have this image in it and changing sorry here with our okay so um the name of this letter template is no i think this is your sign one okay uh alright so no problem actually first of all we can go to the settings module okay and then we can expand the report from the left menu and here we can go into the letter templates so this is the place where we create our customized he letter templates oh right so okay and i need to ask you a question like uh we do need to keep this original later or and uh we can create a new copy of that and make any of the changes which we need or like uh any modifications and give it another name okay oh great still i suppose just let me next okay push it to the template library okay and now we can change the name okay now i can go to the template library so if i because i i think my plan is to try to make a couple of these new letters if i come back to try to create more i'm trying to write down and follow what you're doing here did i need to do those extra steps yes um like uh let's suppose if you need to like uh make copies of a particular template and make some changes like let's suppose if i say one letter is for naven the other one is for cassidy the other one is for any like other provider with their relevant information right so we can just uh push the one which uh we need to replicate to the tempted library right then we go to the template library like this like uh by clicking on your name over here and clicking on template library right then okay when the tempted library opens we can choose the letter templates from from this left tree menu search for that particular letter template which we have pushed to the template library going to that letter template rename it to anything which we like make any changes or just rename it over here so if i choose search i'll just quickly pull it again from the template library into your database so it would be a new copy see work later and work later naven so then we can make any of the changes in this new copy which we need right and we can even rename this well ok new or anything okay so and uh can you tell me the name of the letter template which contains that particular image can you search it over here that particular that has the imaging in it i i i just i copy and pasted that into only that patient no problem uh do you have that uh g pill g with you yeah okay right so what we can do we can simply go into that letter template and here enter okay over here it's not allowing me to left alligne it strange okay no problem just let me try and move the image so okay such it from mhm and now we have an option to select this and for this needs to go what's happened yeah uh huh okay alright so we got the image and we can take out the extra space okay so now we can make any modifications which we need in this letter another funny thing and we can even confirm that what is the font size at the back end anywhere over here i selected select 10 are okay if made it 12 i believe that uh the information contained in this letter is like uh very like precise so what about like uh take the um font size to 12 okay mhm well okay yeah we were okay with 10 upon printing is giving an issue right so any change in the verbaige or any change in the flags which auto populate the information is there a way to put um put the patient date of birth yes mhm no problem that can be auto populated okay how do we do that okay uh so i suppose this is the place uh right where do you have uh your cursor right now okay yeah okay so patients first name last name uh do you need uh we need to add any like a sentence before the deal or like just to directly the first name last name and then the date of birth okay scroll up okay and then from these field like uh we have this type of different types over here which have the flags so from patients field we can choose the patients dob over here and then hit on this plus icon right beside that nope what's happening oh sorry no problem oh okay i just quickly tried at my end okay if you can just uh quickly save the little here just to save the image and then i can open it up my end quickly okay okay got it here and now we can go forward i don't know what's happening at your end that's funny okay okay my next question is there a way to put the the provider credential at all provide the credentials mean like uh the npi or stuff like that um at or like m d p a usually like we would put what we're having to do is add potential okay so this is the uh suffix i mean right yes alright just let me check i believe that we have an option or the flag for the provider suffix as well i know uh yeah for uh like uh to pull this information actually um this uh can only be like switched by if a patient comes in or you have scheduled a patient through schedule module and then this letter has been associated with that particular appointment by like uh associated with the provided note of that particular us that is the date of service so then uh this um flat can be like uh will be uh pulling up the information which is for appointment provider title but just check any other field if uh we have just the title over here far if uh it is like uh um the information is same for every patient or the providers same so we can even hardcore that information over here it's not the same for every providers no i i i feel like mhm i don't know why is this not correct providers something okay so list of those if uh we place this um supposed to be playing this flag over here yeah this might be right okay and then change the font i have to do that at my end as well ok so lest suppose if we pull up a test patient now okay and just in just to check that uh whether that information is hold up okay oh well it didn't work because um now i believe that this destination has not been scheduled right so there's no appointment at the back end for this dissipation if there is appointment and provider has been like associated with this patient for that particular to us then this information will be pulled up in this letter template through a provider note oh so it's only oh so that's the crazy thing that you guys don't have there's gotta be a way to add that i thought no we should have a file or i can look into it yeah i mean oh shoot am i in the wrong place i am yeah i mean this is like a very crucial part of a letter for a patient so i've oh there we are maybe yeah hm yeah this is the one so we can change this just i can't do that at my end so it doesn't give uh the problem for the phone or the next line oh i can't delete this part yeah you can do that mhm we'll see if that work and all i have to do is save yep mhm no i'm not there i also wonder just uh we can check your user profile as well that uh whether do you have that information over there or not so we can go to the settings again okay drop that practice provider over here okay mhm mhm okay yea okay so we have the title okay uh can you add yourself over here i'm sorry i'm gonna check it okay okay this is the perfect now i go back to the just provider okay let's go they don't pay for the time being oh oh no electronic cleans the zip code for billing provider okay no so change is thought to okay so actually i believe that we have put in uh like um the flag for the provider suffix but now uh it's like uh in the profile we don't only have like either we can choose the title or either we can choose the suffix well maybe if we can okay so let's see if we have this mp over here as a title and we go back to that  data template okay and i'll do that at my end quickly current note becoming okay alright so now we can try it quickly on the test patient something like this mm and um i actually need to go and see a patient um i wonder if you could look into it because this is something we we every time we make the letter we have to write it in there it's like a crucial component so it's got to exist okay no problem i can look into it and uh then uh uh you can suggest me a good time so i can give you a call and make uh further modifications or any copies of letter templates yeah i think if we maybe today maybe at like 11 45 okay got it central time that's my 11 45 central time and um that is central time okay 11 45 central yeah okay got this i'll give you a call okay alright thank you so much i appreciate you're welcome bye bye ok bye"}}, {"id": 87, "data": {"call_id": "1622827485.1307473.txt", "text": "please enter your access code followed by hi elaine hi how are you good thank you hello hi gillian how are you doing good how are you we're good thank you uh we're waiting for the rest of our side to get on the call while should be joining shortly and uh we'll get started are you waiting for some of your team or are they gonna watch through you uh no we're waiting for anna and she's restarting your computer so yeah okay hi there and i'm sorry i couldn't hear good we're all good thank you very much i'm just hunting down to get the call started uh give me 1 second please okay wasif should be hopping on in just a second thank you for your patience hi wasif are you there right here how's everybody doing great well good it looks like we have gillian on the call and um anna anna are you the front office yes great nice to have you on the call um wasif all yours awesome so um and going uh before we begin we just wanted to set the um um set the agenda uh upfront and and specifically on today's session we wanted to go over the um front office workflow specifically patient portal the checking how you get patients into the system and then may be followed by registration and scheduling workflows um is that still the plan or you wanted to do with this a little differently no i think that's great yeah and anna is our office manager and she's pretty much involved in all of those aspects that you mentioned awesome alright let's uh we will start off with uh making michaela the presenters she will walk us through the um the initial patient related workflows which is um the patient portal um and uh follow that by we'll show you the the check in process and now those forms are are done and taken care of over there and and all the process how that flows into the entire process on scheduling and then i can take over an answer uh uh for other workflows michaela go go right ahead please awesome thank you so much wasif um so uh nice to meet you uh my name is michaela i work uh with chris and wasif on the implementation side so working with the products and getting uh the getting in front of clients and getting them on boarding so we did talk about you guys a little bit um all good things and one of the things that wasif and chris mentioned was that you guys are looking for a more streamlined way of getting your patients registered getting all that information in and then being able to have that inputted by the patients in a really meaningful way that doesn't bog you down with tons of paper um is that kind of where it is that you guys are envisioning curemd be helping your practice out yes exactly yeah and i do wanna see alright great yeah it's just gonna be the same thing yeah yeah those are usually pretty we straddled two different mr to try and get the appropriate work paperwork because because of oncology there's a lot of um paperwork involved in the you can easily drown the paperwork so one of the things that will highlight is going to be kind of how we can leverage different tools within curemd to maximize our paper list workflows queer way to go about that but that's exactly what we're gonna look for leverage so when we're going in there's gonna be too many pieces to the equation the first is going to be our patient portal uh which is how patients are going to be able to register themselves and then in the future be able to access information regarding any procedures done any blood work they might have had messages back and forth between the providers and patients and so forth so for the patient portal the first thing to do is gonna be to register the patient so there is a really nice easy workflow so right here is our schedule this is where you know you're gonna be able to schedule existing patient schedule new patients this is where our registration workflow is going to start so as far as the workflow for doing that it's as easy as single left click your book appointment slot is gonna come up i'm able to hit quick add and then here i'd enter my demographic information on the patient as i'm sure you've heard before is highly customizable so you're able to toggle on and off different required field so let's say you don't have a lot of patients that are still using a home and you wanna make a mobile number required you can do that um you can add in even custom demographic field uh first this screen so if you want certain data points captured that you don't see here you're able to have that added in so it's just easy as entering information on your patient everything with these orange districts are gonna be required again some really customizable and then if you look at the bottom it says send email invite for registration so right from here my scheduler is able to get that demographic information on the patients get the registration and initial start done and when they hit schedule it's going to send my patient a automated email letting them know that they have been scheduled for an appointment and take them to a link to your personal patient portal to start that registration process the registration invite is going to look like this one moment to pull it up it'll have a individual custom link to the patient where they're able to click it and go directly to your site um this entire message can be customized as well so if there's something that you want to advise them let's say they have to you know bring their ticket stub in for you know reimbursement on parking or they are uh you know you want them to bring paperwork from their primary as well from any other team members with them you want them to bring their pathology report for their first visit you're able to uh include that in your message as well so my patient is able to click on the link i just want to take them to your customized portal so we're able to uh get this everything from your logo to your address to content about your practice you can even change the color scheme on here so we really are able to play around with this a lot and you know really have it reflect your practice and you know what it is that you guys wanna do as far as registration so if you look up to here i have my patients general demographic information and then additional pieces so we did take a look at that intake form that you guys had shared and noted that there were a lot of different uh components to it outside of just consent forms um there were also gathering history about your patient getting details on allergies med family history social history medical history surgical history this all can be incorporated through the workflow of the patient portal you're able to uh enter all that the patient to enter that information at their own leisure so you know you're not sitting filling out forms in the waiting room taking up space and uh you know having to worry about how many people are in there especially now with covid and everything you're able to people out of big waiting rooms with lots of paperwork you're not needing to print anything off it's completely electronic so your patient is able to enter all this information on them mhm oh no i was just gonna say we don't we started we actually don't even typically schedule a patient until they started this process because doctor does all of her research and preparation for each case before the patient comes so we never have anybody paperwork until i mean you know what i mean it needs to be in sort of what is it within like 48 hours and i think ideally but um at least 20 hours that time to cash practice so we don't necessarily insurance you guys before and that makes perfect sense and and for that i mean you showed me a very nicely designed website that you already have so what what happens is that the patient portal uh can live under a patient registration or patient portal link on on your website so folks going to your website can click on that and start this registration process from over there the process doesn't have to start from the scheduler and come back here people can start from your website register and and start this process from over there um that you know what michaela was trying to show is you know sometimes patients our patients find it difficult to to start this on their own so this is one way that you can assist them get them a link that that get the process started for them okay it is um sorry just just send that patients can register for different types of patients we see and that changes that i guess one form that they get we have an oncology questionnaires for patients who have can't say that's what i'm trying to figure out is would we be able to modify things to the point where some people don't have to fill that out or they just yeah absolutely so this can okay yeah so we can either have them skip it or the alternative to is josh will be demonstrating the kiosk workflow and we can customize what everything from what consent to what forms so that you said that oncology questionnaire so what questionnaire stations they're filling out based on their appointment okay you know so let's say you want that to be filled out you know for only certain types of patients you can customize that and uh change that through the kia that's one of those nice pieces and touch on that feature a little bit more when he gets there so once that goes to the registration until this alright um i have one more question but would we be able to modify the forms ourselves or is it like coding so we need to you can modify yourself okay yeah i think that's very coding based a lot of like a higher decrease mhm yeah so you're able to completely uh manage the customizations on your end with that being said we do have a dedicated team that'll help you with it you know if you find that you know what it's driving me up the wall i don't know why this period going over here or why can't get this amount as nicely as i want to um we do have a team that they really are very excellent at being in take your vision and put it into you know an electronic format uh so we are able to do that we do have a dedicated team that does handle all of those but you can do it yourself if you want to okay beautiful thank you absolutely any other questions before i kind of show you how that information for me back at and then uh josh takes over to go through the kiosk no i have no more questions okay and one thing that i just wanted to add was um that that that when you're looking at the um patient portal uh like you said yourself they're starting off a new registration at that time we don't know the type of the appointment so it's mostly like a like a linear workflow um um uh they'll they'll move on and there there will be forms that they can skip once an appointment is scheduled we know exactly what type of patient that is and the consent forms and the type of information that you want to capture uh post that part is customized depending on the type of the appointment thank you exactly so once our patient enters the information whether that's through the quick edit workflow where their details are being entered or it is on your website and they're registering themselves you're able to go to the personal module here and under your patients request you'll see any registration requests or updates and if i expand this out i'll be able to review and see all of the information my patient put in so you're pretty pretty on the spot able to tell if this is appropriate patient if it's not if you're going to accept the registration request or if you reject it you'll see all of their history social history family history all is entered in a structured format surgical history medical history it's as easy as clicking and accepting and then all of that information will then be added into my patient's chart and it'll be present there for the provider when they go forward and um go to create a note or document anything else in that patient chart let me see what it looks like in the actual try to salt absolutely so i'm gonna go to my patient module i'm gonna pull my patient off a hot list there's a couple of different places and then your either most recently and or frequently just depending on how you have it configured i'm gonna expand out my clinical menu when i click on history i'm able to see my family history for my patient the details and then that it was added via the portal and what date it was done on unable to see that i'm able to click into my patient added any allergies if they put any medication details in there um so this is one of those really nice time savers it you know helps with your critical flow and that you don't have some you know for a person that stuff trying to read some of these handwriting off a sheet of paper um instead you have all these details entered structured format and by that i mean they're gonna pull forward into components if you were to extract any reports for plenty patient files they would come up uh it's all kind of fit together really nicely and put that back in a patient responsibility of them putting those details in patient has their demographic information their history any other pieces that they had entered and that's all done through that patient portal registration workflow not a single piece of paper no trees were harmed in the making of this exactly any questions before we kind of show you the second piece of this excellent so i showed you how patients are gonna be able to enter that information leveraging that patient portal leveraging that registration workflow how we can get demographic and clinical information here the next step of this is gonna be how the patients once they arrive at your office how they'll be able to complete consent to fill out appointment specific questionnaire um and to check themselves in without any front desk uh interference and for that we're going to work with the kiosk application so i will turn it over to josh for that and while we're doing that um you know just so that you know that the kiosk is essentially um an ipod right so you're you have a large screen sitting in the front desk that is set up to function as a kiosk so you know like a fancy word there but essentially it's an ipad app that lives on on there and it's um you could put it on a stand there upfront and uh um ipad cameras you'll see in the demo is going to be used for uh taking the pictures and all that kind of stuff of the insurance card or the patient's picture and you can complete the work flow over there that's awesome however most of our patients that come out of state um okay would we still be able to utilize this platform to obtain we want to obtain every form from them before they are scheduled or come into the office so we would have to have their consent forms everything prior to them coming in but above sitting here and checking in so would that still work if you guys provide an outside the system specifically um also a lot of our patients from out of state so whenever they have consultation way before they even come in all through the phone so how does that work with the system okay you want to take that up yep yep can you hear me okay great so uh one way that we can do is you can leverage consent through the patient portal um part of you know part of the the benefit of doing it through kiosk is that uh you'll see that you have a nice signature that comes up and communicate directly into the application so it's looked up through a uh api directly add itself to the patient chart with that being said there are some forms that you could have signed on the portal that would allow for you to do that prior to the patient um if you guys and so when you're saying that you're doing a phone is the full thing done via phone yeah so like i would say about 94% of our patients from out of state so a lot of them don't have the ability to primarily something yeah so we do have a um of the product line called nobel health so what that is is a version of its a fully integrated telemedicine platform and what that'll do is it'll work with the application and it allows for the signing of consent to the collection of copay the um you know patient to be able to for that to be done completely remotely um all the consent forms will flow from novel health into the curemd application the provider will be able to launch you know whether it's a visit that includes the video or just audio to be able to launch that directly from the curemd application as well so uh that can be done that can be accommodated using you know a couple of different alternatives i'm so sorry uh background didn't charge what the name of that program was yeah so it's called novel health it is and we can um a little bit more with you as well but it is a fully integrated telemedicine platform that is built into curemd um sorry i just said i have two questions here i don't i mean i think that for for initial you know for initial patients you know like a lot of them are um their initial interaction is virtual so but i was curious you're the novel and the kiosk are these things that are included and just the the monthly cost of the program i can answer that question so so um so everything that you've seen uh uh so far apart from that uh telemedicine app uh telemedicine platform is included uh telemedicine per provider is uh uh $49 uh per month per provider on top of it okay and then the kiosk aspect um does it is there a way for so it's only if you're in the physical office and you're gonna you know use the ipad is that correct it sounds like a really dumb question but my brains trying to figure out so um but yeah i am i'm not exactly sure that we would use this because come into our office our physical office they like we said we they they have all their paperwork already done before they even step into the office um so and of course we don't have insurance so it's cash um so of course that ends up being on the back end in terms of check out um primarily so um i i certainly see the aspect of and this might be something that's more patient portal oriented we're we're giving patients reminders on their phones if they are interested in that and we're able to do some of this initial paperwork that we're talking about in a mobile from a mobile platform that i can see but i'm not exactly sure um that will be able to use the kiosk i mean doctor is so oriented towards interacting with her patients and i'm not i'm not sure that we're not just not just not that busy to necessitate an ipad for patients to interact with upon arrival yeah i mean i'm not saying that we would now i think maybe the i think that's a good point i don't think we will utilize the kiosk like in this at all because we need to have the consent forms way before they even come in because there's a lot of work we do for our patients so we don't wanna have them not consent to have the stuff we do before we do it i'm sorry after we do it sure so so in that case it makes perfect sense i guess what we could do is um show you the kiosk anyway i mean it's it's there if you want to use it if you don't want to use it that's fine um in my and but when i'm um for for this purpose i just wanted to state that um apart from everything that they've filled out on the uh on the portal if there are elements that you want them to like physically sign sign and i'll show you how that looks like um the the kiosk um will function uh better in those cases and and um and and then if you want to collect payments um like even cash up front uh the kiosk can function in that case as well um let's go through this quickly and it you know it doesn't have to be used for consent forms um for it could simply uh maybe inform the front desk to the the or or allow them to self check in um after they've uh they've done it so it's not like you have to do the uh the entire thing you could you could pick and choose what works for you or not at all right i mean if it doesn't work for you you know this is not a mandatory thing um but um just take a look and see if anything of that works for you otherwise we'll we'll skip it moved on to the next step cool okay alright go for it josh okay but didn't want to uh uh make josh feel bad because i invited into the demo alright hey everyone how are you doing i'm pretty well thank you very much so um alright starting off uh first thing uh what it looks like is you wanna be checking in the patient so we're just gonna click check in it has the option to scan in the driver's license or entering personal details so we're gonna go with entering personal details and after that uh it'll print your boarding passes and you can take your flight okay so as you can see uh a list of patients note that they have an appointment and it basically takes them through uh some of their basic demographic information if they want to update that if obviously that's not something uh that is necessary they can skip all of that uh going on to insurance is if you were to add an an insurance you can select the plan put in the policy and after putting that in what we can do is take a picture of the front and back of an insurance card which is not what you're going to do but we wanted to show you that anyway because it looks cool yep we do ask for the insurance is since we try to run less than alright after that's done as you can see this is one option of one of the customer forms that are in uh as customizable so whatever information is put in is directly put into the patient's chart and yeah these can be added for more or less any appointment reasons you choose so uh say a patient does come in for a certain type of visit and you want them to fill out you know certain forms those will be available for them for that particular appointment only and i'm hoping you're you're able to recognize the form there because that's one of the forms so after that uh yeah after that has been put in as you can see uh this is one of the consent forms that was put in practice and uh as you can see this is also a part of it that's customizable as well uhm after uh the agreed to the consent as you can see this scenario where they can sign uh using the ipad so they can simply put in their signature and hit done the signature will auto populate and all their consent forms and they are checked in this is so great the functionality this is lovely and actually makes that initial intake paperwork seem really easy and i just wonder if there is a way for this to exist either on on mobile through the patient portal or uh desktop and i don't know it would it be similar to what we just observed or will it be i mean obviously they're not going to take the photographs of their insurance can i don't know i'm just wondering what translates to patient portal from what we just saw well this is mostly used for check in so so the patient portal as you uh well sorry go ahead my bad okay uh so yeah this is a monthly available so all right you can go ahead i'm just gonna be here sorry uh i was just gonna say that uh uh the kiosk exists exactly the way you saw it it's not um currently designed to live on on the uh phones for patients it is designed so that it it's it's done on an ipad there we are working on a patient facing version of it so that the process can be done um on their phones but it's still not in production is yet but uh you know when it comes out you'll expect you can expect something similar over there so right now it's a combination of the patient portal uh the browser based patient portal and uh this check in kiosk to get the process job done whatever works for either practice mhm okay alrighty then um so uh next up i'd like to show you more in terms of registration and scheduling capabilities and and take it from there any questions before we go ahead and do that no i'm ready alrighty then um i'm going to share my screen and thank you josh in the on the chat there i i sent you a link for novel health um novel health dot ai that's it's like a separate um u r l for this as well because part of it is um um a provider marketplace patients to i mean you might have heard of zock dock so it's kind of uh uh it starts off with a replacement for that people can locate the providers in a particular locality um you know search for their open appointment slots and and book that um but you know it is also our telemedicine uh platform"}}, {"id":

can call you back with you i just wanted to let you know one thing uh regarding the emails uh that was mandatory it's just because uh it's required by the patient portal so uh that's the only reason emails are actually mandatory if you're no longer using the portal that's different i can turn it off otherwise it would be difficult we are using email but what i'm saying is whenever i am setting up a new patient down on the bottom right hand corner there should be there's a little box that says doesn't wanna register whatever you say that's because they don't that's because they don't have an email so uh yeah that and the demographics page i can't have it say that they have to have an email or i'm just gonna plug in a fake whatever on the demographics pages not actually mandatory but it is when you're quick adding patients okay so when yeah leave it on there then because when you're quick adding you shouldn't be quick adding because you need to go through the other way and you need to put in the address okay because yeah on the home address and stuff because you have the normal way for reading patients it's no longer mandatory but uh yeah for a quick adding it's mandatory unless

are you i'm good as well its regarding your ticket like uh doctor prizarro is not able to sign a super bill like uh what's the problem um it's actually doctor wife who send the super bill we just had a patient who um she left and just when we try to go and send off her prescriptions it won't let us fax them because the super bill isn't signed but when you go to the super bill it says something else can we do anydesk by any chance yes yes sure do you need the code yes i need the code alright 907513 1700 and if you see traffic okay just give me a moment so the prescription you need the the prescription flag added over here let me just pull up real quick yeah this prescription so actually this prescription needs to be erxed first so the doctor needs erx prescription then the system will allow you to sign the uh provider note okay um how would she do that exactly okay like she just need to uh like these medications if the duties are correct she just need to select the provider like the provider is selected joey wiseman man needs to select the uh the pharmacy sorry which pharmacy this needs to be directed to if yeah if it has been in e faxed so you need to remove the association from the prescription uh from this provider in order this prescription because our system is taking it as a normal prescription or you can just click on prescribed from over there just this is just a paper prescription so let me ask you how come she can't sign off on her notes without putting it like if she's basically saying that i need to sign off on the prescription but the problem is is that we have to fax over the prescription so and she can't close out on her notes until she signs off on the prescription okay now can you please try if she's able to sign no but she's not even here but now she's not gonna be in here till tomorrow okay okay okay don't you worry i've just paper prescribed this prescription and hopefully let me just see yes now you'll be able to sign that okay okay okay okay so once she signs it then we can go ahead and fax it over to wherever we need to yeah she's now able to sign the note without any trouble because the prescription which he added needs to be prescribed so if she's faxing the prescription she needs to just hit on prescribe which means that it's a paper prescription oh and then all the information okay so for example the pharmacy requested all this information that we need to incorporate into the facts we would just put all that information there yes you need to put all the information like what you're faxing you need to fax pharmacy the i believe the prescription only or you are sending the whole note to the pharmacy i'm so sorry what was that again sir are you sending the whole note to the pharmacy or just the prescription prescription only because but but the company is asking for obviously the patient's information and then the prescription and the instructions on the prescription as well as a d e a number what is d e a number it's it's it's a license number actually that's been issued to the provider that usually do controls of substances is not it npi that we provide no the np is different in d e a is different so what where can we find you know where we can find the dea number you need to ask the the provider must have the dea number got it okay and that's outside of the tax number right now there's so many bloody numbers okay so tomorrow we'll explain it to her how to do it and then she can go ahead and fax it over okay also quick question we just have another patient are you are we doing a remote session and so i'm gonna take charge for 1 second this patient we have so she has already been seen twice and we looked at the charges and there was a $30 outstanding but we applied it there was like a $30 here outstanding but we applied it but because she's been seen in may how come i haven't seen her like the credit card that we would run is she paying by credit mhm so the credit card that we've been using how come i don't see payments on the reconciliation uh actually this is basically the billing part so uh for that you can log a support ticket for that so that we can decide it to the billing team and they will get in get in touch with you and explain you the problem okay i'll i'll i'll open up a ticket for that okay because it just it's not making sense why she's not showing up there when we okay okay yeah okay thank you you're welcome take care have a good day bye bye bye bye"}}, {"id": 93, "data": {"call_id": "1620388690.763374.txt", "text": "thank you for calling curemd

i p s okay um i think that's possible because i have actually worked on one concern as such uh not exactly outlook configuration but then a sharepoint access restriction so definitely based on ip base we can create a few access policies i'm just going to your subscriptions and checking if we have the required uh i know how to respect uh it is uh it is very easily for to configure to sharepoint we can define access uh access control on the sharepoint sites we can restrict but uh the problem is hello yeah i'm listening to you okay okay so the problem is uh this is exchange so we have to uh user another method so there is no option in the exchange portal as well yeah definitely the option is not an exchange portal it is something that's an access policy in azure that we can modify as for a requirement however i will first have to test it on my end once i ensure that it's working as expected i can actually give you an action plan okay uh let me tell you one more thing i have tested uh you know uh microsoft exchange online is dependent on many other services like uh microsoft teams or you can say one drive or other they are totally integrated so if i block uh one service from azure conditional access policy so other service uh will be blocked uh if i restrict exchange online so people will not be able to access microsoft teams on other i p s so there is a problem uh with the conditional access policy so okay uh i'm sure i'm definitely 100% sure condition conditional access will not work so i have worked with conditional access policies uh to other uh uh scenarios so this will not work for me so one more thing i can tell you i have restricted uh over which is outlook dot office dot com login access using exchange client client access policy which is a a power shell commands so but i didn't find any uh command for mappi so i can strict people to only uh access their email box on using over from my office premises i p s only so i i i'm managing this without any problems so the second option is coming uh from the security team to restrict this as well so take your time no problem you can find a solution or uh you can consult with your other team members so definitely you can have the solution for it sure definitely i want to understand one thing so um you did mention they are configuring their mailboxes on outlook so definitely there configuring using the exchange of like the normal id password and we just want to restrict this restriction outside the i p s of our organization right within the organization they should be allowed should i sit on the local desktop okay um allow me sometimes let me discuss this with my colleagues and let me uh sure sure sure no problem there is no so i'm not in a hurry you can take your time and you can suggest me uh a appropriate solution so how can i prevent people to configure their mailboxes outside the organization mhm sure certainly i'll get back to you on this i have your email address i'll just drop you an email right away just establish an email communication in case if you have any additional points to mention please do reply to my email with those additional points while i get back to you okay okay sure sure thank you thank you very much thank you thank you so much for your time thank you take care bye"}}, {"id": 94, "data": {"call_id": "1620334667.758576.txt", "text": "thank you for calling CureMD this is bryce how can i help you hey bryce this is annet my choice health calls how are you i'm good how are you i'm well i am calling because i just had a question and i think something is not working correctly so i'm i'm in a test provider note i don't know if you want to do a screen share if you have availability right now to do it but sure i can i can do that i have anydesk code whenever you're ready okay i'm ready 144050761 okay there you are all right i'm on screen too if you need something okay alright so i'm in the test patient's chart and we're trying to develop a different system for how things are followed up so typically our providers will go over here and they would say follow up and blah blah blah weeks and then they would put their instructions here but we want to use the task option here and so i'm trying to put a task here and then i want to specify to a group of users why why isn't like the role group showing up you know typically there's like lab provider in navigator mm you mean there are groups here instead of the users yeah typically it would show up as like i'll address the first problem first problem is this like when i go in here and i select names so i want to sign it to these people right here okay there's no save option there's no nothing so i'm like okay i'm gonna exit out and it doesn't do anything like it completely closes out of the whole thing okay could you do that one more time did you click on follow up right and uh i'll let you do it okay go to recall recall okay and then select in blah blah blah weeks at the top i'm sorry right here right here in we typically they would put instructions here but we wanna utilize this so they're gonna put instructions down here and then i wanna sign it how do i sign it okay um after that we will go to next i believe and then select the users or maybe we can do it later uh the user thing okay so after that specify to select a couple it's fine okay and then what oh so you have to close out of it first yes i believe so we need to close out of it and then save and accept can we do that like fresh one again just to make sure can i delete this yeah go ahead and delete it how do i delete it i don't even know how to delete it do i need to create a new note uh yes just let's go ahead and create a new one alright so add a provider note donna catherine um alright great alright and you go down to the bottom and you hit follow up recall okay they put the date in and then i should be able to it gives me the option i should be able to sign it but it won't i have to hit next uh hold on just give me one second okay uh that's fine add user mm that's a couple all i did was just close it and where to go no i'm in chrome yeah there but it didn't show up okay call yeah it closes out of that other box it might be like a glitch or something it could be uh yes after closing it i think it's closing the whole thing okay alright uh let me go ahead and see if can we minimize this i wanted to see all the settings are good did you try it on a different computer and same results i did not try it on a different computer no okay uh we tried it on ipad uh huh and still the same still the same okay do you have change the provider name what did you do i'll show you just give me one moment probably technically assign it to specific prescription people or scheduling what are you saying i see what you're doing so basically it's not showing up right now like whom its assigned to correct no it's not should it uh i believe it should follow up okay what i did was i actually saved it first okay without adding the users i just put a next button and i did created a record follow up then i added the you know specify and then add users okay yep then i closed it and save and access okay i will try that out then thank you no problem is there anything else i can help you with no thank you i appreciate it you're welcome no problem have a nice day bye bye"}}, {"id": 95, "data":

let me just check for sure hang on let me just log in it doesn't do it it's new though since you guys like upgraded your and you're using google chrome right yeah i believe i am hang on i'm still but that's usually what i use on this computer okay sorry my computer's slow wow google chrome yeah okay and also uh the loading tune uh can you confirm that uh what is your landing page is it the patient page or is it the personal page where you have the dashboards i don't know if you could if you could you know just log in and tell me you know which page oh it's my there's that noise um it's my personal personal page okay let me just get i need a session of this little need to record it because otherwise there's no way for me because actually i'm not actually getting this on my end which is actually a bit concerning really yeah and this just just like started maybe a week ago two weeks ago it's just so annoying yeah i can definitely understand that because every day you know the first time it happened i was like what yeah if it happened just you know like maybe once at the start of you logging in you know for the first time maybe that would make sense other than that yeah too much okay let's see because we don't have anything in particular uh one thing that we can do is uh we do have sound alerts for patient notes can you just check if those are active for you if you go into uh the personal page at the bottom on the left hand side from my preferences you have the patient section from from there just uh enable sound alerts for patient notes is checked just to check that it's safe and then try logging in again so it's my preference outpatients so click on that and it doesn't do anything uh patient oh there we go okay i got it i got it okay uh okay enable drag wait at the top there should be enabled sound alert for patient notes i don't have that i have enabled drag oh enables for patient okay so unclear checked so i okay and then hit safe oh as long as i'm in here and the other issue i had i wasn't gonna make a deal of it but if i have you on the phone can i um when i'm doing the free text in the the beginning of the clinical note in the hpi it used to do automatic spell check and correct everything and now it's not doing that anymore again i haven't changed anything yeah they used to be like a thing for internet explorer specifically because it had that built in so whenever you were free typing it would give you auto correct for chrome you will uh you can get an extension for uh if you download an extension for spell check it can just configure into cure md as well so just go on to the chrome store from there just type in spell checker uh get one of those and you know whichever one feels better you can activate that okay alright alright let me click out of here mhm and let's do the sign in again doesn't work nope give me give me one min okay okay thank you i think i'm on um internet explorer ha ha okay okay um okay so i apologize um i was on internet explorer oh internet explorer okay yeah so i switched it i there was that little icon on that um first page with i did it with chrome and i didn't have that annoying that noise because yeah i was concerned about that let's let me actually check with your practice on internet explorer if i can actually get on my side then i can actually investigate why that's happening oh okay and other than that uh one more thing uh what is your 1 second yes alright uh yeah sorry about that so that's okay let's see i'd also like to just do a screen share with you in order to see what exactly it is on your end if you don't mind okay so i went back to the internet explorer because i was able to oh and then like i said it didn't make that noise so i'm on the log in page on internet explorer so do you want me to log in or what do you want me to do i know what you want to share before you can log in if you could just download any desk on your screen uh tell me again how to do that uh just go to any desk dot com that's a n y d e s k dot com hm okay i'm getting it too now you're getting it all we have two okay so i think it is kind of practice specific because open a bunch of others than getting anything i eat but for yours yeah i think there might be something that's actually making that noise any any desk download do you want me to download or any death free download okay so tonight since my connection is not private let me try also i guess you must have a bunch of tasks right on cure on uh yeah just mean you guys utilize the task section right to assign yourself tasks no i don't okay it won't let me download sure i've got two okay i also wanted to just confirm what your role is kind of like in the practice i mean um how many modules do you need access to uh that kind of thing um i'm a nurse practitioner and i just do i just document um my visits so i do the clinical aspect i don't do anything with pass or prescriptions but i have access to the uh the palette of care side yes and also uh what about uh doing documents or just uh uploading them or scanning them into the document manager do you have any for that no alright because you see for a chrome uh in the same level of access except for uh downloading a certain client utility that we have uh so the first time you're using it i can just help you get into the client utility because you would wanna view documents from time to time that are available in the patient's chart right yeah so for that if you could just log in with google chrome and go into the document manager module okay so and then alright i just logged in and see you don't hear that annoying thing now what do you want me to the document manager section that comes right after the scheduler if you go in there you probably uh see a kind of grey area in rich there'll be an option to download something you mean okay i'm sorry um you mean document name yeah there's uh uh document um the the if you enter into the module itself i mean like uh you see the modules on the top uh right i guess so there's home there's uh assigned for patient the scheduler and then the document manager scheduler document i apologize okay okay yeah so once you're there uh do you see an option in grey you know there's writing to download something if you could click on that link oh the dots that are going up and down oh okay got it got it got it and once you click on download just install that file and once it's fully installed let me know okay please wait i'm not seeing anything in that bar oh here we go do you have it on my end i'm not sure uh you have to actually install it on your computer went to see the you know windows pop up to go to my home my whole computer went like grey i mean i still have my login page but i have none of my icons or anything on your entire pc you mean yes oh here we go uh do you want to allow this to make changes to i am not admin oh okay so if you could get the uh admin privileges what that could do is as long as you get this installed and hit launch that will launch the document manager for you as well because we just need this client utility to actually run the explorer for google chrome other than that everything else works the same so you can just use google chrome instead of internet explorer so you don't get that noise yep that's i think what i'll do it was found that other than that i will report it to our team and i will let you know if we find something for it because currently uh actually we're not aware of anything that could you know that noise at the moment but i will ask them and i will let you know if they find anything okay alright yeah that's good i'm glad you got it on your computer it isn't just something uniquely to mine yeah but then you can see why it's annoying yeah yeah of course uh but uh yeah for now just use chrome and just get the admin to you know download that utility on your end once that's good the documents will be available for you as well and really there's um no other need to actually use i e other than that so yeah you can continue with chrome yep i will such an easy fix who would have thought alright anything else i can do with no huh i appreciate all your help alright then you have a good day"}}, {"id": 104, "data": {"call_id": "1620402969.77067.txt", "text": "thank you for calling CureMD this is robert how may i help you uh hello

supposed to be nice weather so we're good to go it's supposed to be really good weather oh okay nice nice very good so what what do you have planned for that i'm just going to the lake like a picnic thing no like boating oh that is good good plan that is a good plan alright awesome now that you have motivated me to do something as well i might just paint some of the walls in the house to do at least make use of good weather no that's not fun that's not fun we did that earlier in the year oh you did that's not what we did in the process i know we'll just hang in there it'll be worth it yes definitely definitely so i uh i'm calling in particular about that uh accidental deletion of a provided note yes so i don't know 100% if i deleted it even if you delete it is still there you can still respect that is what i thought can you walk me through that process do i have that capability as a super user okay so if you go to that same patience note where you deleted it okay hold on just a moment let me get back to that screen i'm there do you see a deleted tab i have a deleted note deleted note tab click on that please okay i did and do you see it do you see the note okay just uh there should be a button there to restore this one and you can still view it if you don't want to restore you can still view it within this tab but if you want to restore you can still restore it just click on the note where's the button oh you don't see the restore button give me one second oh yes i do i do i've got it right here okay i'm getting a pop up window that says the provider note will be restored plain text with no data entered in clinical components that is correct proceed so basically what happens is initially when before you deleted the note all of the data was basically was showing within each component what i mean by that is um so prescription it'll be a flag for the prescription white will be shown under the prescription while section but now it'll be just a plain text note because if you want to restore everything is just gonna be a plain text you're not gonna see any flags like you normally do within a normal provider note before deletion if that makes sense so go ahead and just try it it's not gonna look any weird is you're just not gonna be able to you know uh uh what do you call it um edit something uh within a component you can add information from a new component if that makes sense so everything that was saved will be copied and restored completely okay yes that's what i want i thought what had happened yesterday i think i highlighted an extra note but i did not think that i could delete a note if it was signed uh that's the problem it's not signed it's in draft form you can still delete a note in the draft form once it's signed you then you can delete it right but if it's signed it has to be unsigned correct that is correct that is correct where it can be so that's why i was able to accidentally delete that okay yeah that's what happened okay there is nothing on this note i see why would that be would it maybe be because it's in draft form uh let me go to the same patient as well to make sure that uh i see it too so you've restored it already i did and it's um a medication refill provider note from 511 okay give me 1 second i did not know that that was an option i've never even had to go up to that tab and look at that i know it's it's just one of those things that you you know we all don't pay attention to until it's brought up so 5 11 yeah medication refill i see that yes so i need you to see if there's anything that it's a blank it's a blank note so basically when you deleted the note there was nothing in it so it's a blank note okay so i will check with that provider to see if there's any reason that there's a blank on that patient i mean if you look at the logs of this patient actually it just says that it was restored but it was when it was created there was nothing attached within the note so if you want you can still see the logs of this patient if you want to i mean the provider note do you want do you want me to walk you through that as well so if you get i don't know that i know that's fine so if you just click on if you just go back to the page where all the provider notes are listed okay and uh you see the 511 one look on the right side of the screen you see a log button yes click on the log button please i did see that showing as it shows it was so click on the restore it's like a hyperlink okay mhm so when you click on the hyperlink created it was only created if there was more logs i mean if there was something added to the note like any clinical information it would have been shown here because there was nothing added so there's nothing else to be shown here okay so it would have stated like even if there was clinical information it would have shown right exactly so it was just the opening of the note and that was it that was it nothing else was added to the note perfect thank you all so i is the security administrator um i hope that this never happens again but should it happen that's all i would need to do that is correct and i wouldn't have to submit a ticket to notify anyone of that no you will not have to and that was previously everything that was previously stored would be restored and then you would just depend a note that is correct okay okay dear now do you have the capability to unsigned that restored note unsigned this it is already unsigned no i'm just saying um oh yes but you can't delete the note until it's unsigned right that is correct okay so that that eliminates that concern if i were to do this again thank you so much oh no problem no problem have a wonderful day you too dear bye bye bye"}}, {"id": 111, "data": {"call_id":

that uh whenever you're submitting the claims to the railroad medicare they are sending the rejection that uh you guys are not approved for the electronic submissions yeah well the thing is that previously back in 2018 i guess uh when your practice was implemented the railroad medicare was not enrolled and uh the reason why it was not enrolled because your address is not correct the addresses which you gave us you gave us like three addresses and those three are not in the insurances record that's why they were rejecting the edi and era enrollment for railroad okay got you yeah i called them and they i guess they had our old 53 south french broad address which is where we were when we first started CureMD and they told me we need to update it to our new 40 cox avenue location so i've got that submitted and into them waiting on it to get approved okay hopefully i just didn't know if once it got address got changed to 40 cox if that was um so that's something we do uh the thing is that once the records are updated you can log a new ticket and then we will initiate the era and edi enrollment okay that sounds good and and the enrollment uh completion time is usually like seven business days so within seven business days your enrollment will be approved or if they reject it they usually update us within three business days that it is not acceptable and uh uh we will keep you posted so you can log a new ticket once you are approved with the railroad medicare and then we will initiate all the enrollments okay that sounds good no problem i appreciate it no problem thank you

figure out how to process this payment for a patient okay sure we can do that do you have the number okay perfect give me one second okay okay it's 907 513 170 17 okay um before we go ahead i just wanted to know have you already logged the ticket for this issue or you're just calling it right away no it's it's not an issue it's just i'm i'm just i need um just a quick little tutorial i was just asking if there is already so i could have you know closed that one okay so i can see your screen so yeah the super bill is already written i just don't know how to process the unapplied payment if you could just show me how okay now in order to see which of the bill we have we'll go to the provider note so which data service are we talking about this one the first one yes the sixth okay we'll go to the visit go added super bill i just wanted to see if the charge has been created or not okay so the thing is this is a charge okay oh sorry this is a super bill for when when the super bill is created there is no responsibility its just the super bill is not something substantial it doesn't open up any balance in there in order to create a balance under patient profile or under the plan profile as well we need to create a charge so you see this button on top when you click on it it says create charge now what it does what it's gonna do it's gonna open up a balance of $199 against the specific patient oh the connection is disconnected i can't see your screen i'm reconnecting can you accept it oh thank you okay so sorry so we were here yes i was telling you that now when we're going to save this charge it's gonna create this responsibility of $199 against patient so we'll save it now the first part is done we have created the responsibility on top you see previously was only showing up 199 as unapplied now it is showing up a balance of 199 against patient now what you have to do you just have to go to the payment section and you have to allocate this from this box you see this box allocate from unapplied just enter 199 here tap it out it will automatically enter each and every information that was selected at the time of payment you don't have to manually enter the other information like the credit card information or the payment date you just save it and the payment is allocated oh okay so you just go under the provider notes and you can get the so what's the word the charge number for it or the the procedure number yes add it and then you go to add now if the charges already there so you will see this option add a charge okay now in that case things would be much sorry much easier that means since the charge has already been created if the charges not created just save it and then go to this payment section okay and the the procedure number should automatically go in because it's from their notes yes it's it's gonna pre populate in fact most of the information like the location provider information diagnosis procedure amount data service everything is going to be pre populating from the super bill you just have to simply save the charge and once the charges created you come on this page and you enter the amount here now since we have already taken the advance so that's why we're using this allocate option if this is a new payment or this is the payment uh that the patient is paying right away or maybe for an outstanding old balance then you simply put an amount in this box like $100 if the patient is paying so that's how you go about it but if it's an advance that has already been taken you put the amount in this box that is allocated under unapplied okay got it thank you so much that was really helpful no worries thank you so much anything else i can help you with um no you've been great that's it have a good day you too bye bye"}}, {"id": 127, "data": {"call_id": "1622563571.1207395.txt", "text": "doctor hannah speaking how may i help you hi hannah this is harry from CureMD can i speak with marin brooks

curemd application if you're planning on to purchase a windows computer regardless if it's from microsoft or it's from any other company called surface laptop and this microsoft ok yeah uh it should be compatible because it's running windows operating system on it so um yes i think you should be able to uh use the curemd application on it just ask for a windows 10 if the surface laptop has windows 10 okay so that would be fine yes that would be fine is there any minimum requirement for the um well with windows 10 um just make sure you get eight gigabytes of ram that is um a necessary um things you have minimum eight gigabytes yes anything more than that is good enough but you should have at least eight gigabytes because if you don't have that in that much of memory it's gonna make your computer run slow whenever you use curemd or any other websites so it sometimes gets slow yeah intel core i five 10th generation processor that that's perfect yes that cpu is perfect okay then

designation on uh this practice i am a medical assistant okay then you should have those yeah deena the practice administrator usually gives me whatever i ask for because you know i've been doing this for 30 years just not that long in this system so she knows i'm not going to mess anything up on purpose so let me take you to that uh permission i'll give you the required permission so if you go to patient in here jane okay um uh there is this report called search so this is a vast sort of report if you need to search any of the patients in the system so if you click on new oh okay so now if you go all the way down do you see the zip option here so what was the it was 33418 alright so now if you put in the zip code now if you go up top and hit on search so these are the patients i believe these are two pages these are the patients with that zip code and you can see their addresses as well yeah it looks like there's three left with it 8039 can i print this yes you can you can simply click content or you can export it on excel as well so you need to select all the patients yes all the patients that way i can check them one at a time i'm old school alright alright so uh let me show

be happening okay so you do not have just give me a minute jane has it been printed out yes okay we can access that yeah so this was the patient that you changed earlier yes okay so let me see on my end if i can figure it out who exactly uh and why exactly uh the address got changed or maybe somebody practice those changes well i technically didn't change him back deena did the practice administrator i let her know that the addresses were incorrect and she fixed them no but i'm harvey will pop up okay so we do have uh for the users uh but im not sure about the patients just give a minute okay so uh jane i'm unable to find at the moment that why uh the the address for these patients got changed uh in the first place uh but uh you have those patients names now and you can

reach tamara jones but she's not asking the call can i ask you if she's available in the office yes she she she is here uh she might be on the phone do you want to leave a message or do you i tried like twice or thrice to actually reach her so i'm actually pretty sure maybe she's not on her seat sir can you do me a favor if you can check that for me it's really urgent okay hold on please thank you this is tamara hi tamara this is pete i'm calling from cure md how are you doing today yes sorry i've been out of my office working on time sheets and i understand that um actually it's regarding your email for sampson county and it's for the uh you have actually requested us for hr account set up so you can actually go for the service of their ambulance department correct right right yes uh tamara um we need to actually clear one thing out at this moment because we can see uh then the covid 18 insured plan is already there in the system but i'm actually trying to uh if you could actually elaborate this um to me like what you actually needing at this point so you can start bidding okay we we have about 15 okay long story short the county of sampson has one tax id number for all departments okay and we are set up as the main one for billing with hrsa for covid testing and covid activities so our ambulance department has about 15 covid patient claims that are uninsured that they need to build through hrsa and and we can't do it directly it has to go through a clearing house so it has to go through us because we're already set up with hrsa so under that tax id and they can't set themselves up so bill did a work order for us to get their medical to get their medical director so we could set him up because they can't go out as a health department claim it's got to go out as an ambulance claim right so you mean like you just want the provider to be added in your profiles right in your practice database so they can actually use that provider while they're submitting the claims to the insurance i'm sorry for covering 19 uninsured plan so um you just want the provider to be shown in the vending and uh billing provider correct on the charges right but when i talked with christina about you know what we needed to get it set up she said something about traditional and you bay billings and so i don't know something about the ambulance was a different billing type than what we were using right that may need to be set up and i don't know anything about that okay uh tamara this is why i'm actually calling you because when you actually talk about like since you have a one tax id for all the departments and i can see you you are actually sending the claims to that specific um insurance for covid 19 insured plan and then you actually talk about a single provider which needs to be there as a rendering and billing provider so you could actually some mitchell ambulance claims that makes sense to me in this case what i think you all only what is what you actually needing at this point is the provider so it'd be it should actually pops up on your charges when you send in the claim to the insurance correct i think so but i wasn't sure what christina was talking about with traditional and ub traditional n u v u b um u b as in boy okay ub be so uh can i ask you as the provider name please let me see if i can find it trip because i i asked bill um the we need to fill out that provider form and he said he would let me know so i'm gonna have to have the ambulance fill that out because i don't know their medical director name hang on just a second um because they sent me discovery documentation that she filled out mm billing discovery document it's actually different we are actually talking about the submissions right now and if if it's just the provider that you need on the charge we can get that for you we can actually she sent me his okay his name is christopher chino close to free o cc h i n o okay and then i have his npi number is 1033 163993 i'm sorry 1033 and 163993 got you give me one moment bear with me okay thank you so much for staying on the line tamara tamara i'm just checking your practice database and currently this provider is not being added into the system now my question is at this point in case if it's added like once we add the specific provider in your practice database so would that be actually going to the insurance when you send the claims under the same name like which is samson county health department under the group n p i 1619036399 with a tax i d 566 triple 0338 the tax id yes but the mpi for the ambulance is different perfect no problem we'll get that for you and we'll actually make the group accordingly so you can submit the claim under the right npi and the tax id okay and i don't know what the ambulance mpi is don't worry just give me one moment i can do a look up probably on the npi let me see uh one more question at this point uh can i ask you if this provider will be actually billing just one insurance which is covid 19 uninsured plan for the ambulance that's all that's all we'll be billing for just for uh uninsured plans right the covid-19 yes okay give me one moment let me right um i have a question for you to for example for this specific provider when you will be creating um ambulatory charge so which place of service will be used okay there's um well they don't have a it's a okay i found their npi number and their taxonomy is actually ambulance land transport can i have the npi it's 122 5076813 got you and uh just give me one second i'm just going to be double checking that they have they have an address of 107 underwood street clinton correct that's their primary address but it's ambulance pickups that's right now in this case we're gonna be we'll be actually we'll be actually going to do at this time we will actually make sure like this provider is being added in the practice database and it is active to send the claims to submit the claims and after that we will make a group under this specific np npi with the same tax id you have with the other groups which is five double six uh triple 0338 and after that we will be actually adding the address and making sure that it has the right speciality in it so you can submit the claim now whenever you will be you will be actually sending the claims for covid 19 ambulatory um charges for the service so you will be actually selecting that provider as soon as you will select the provider you will have the right details pops up on the front end so you can enjoy it okay okay so do you have any other information to actually you want us to share do you need that taxonomy number that i'm seeing we have that it's 3416 l 0300 x thats ambulance land transport yes great yes thank you so much tamara for sharing this information we will actually look into it and um we'll add the provider we ll set up the group and once everything is ready once you uh then you will be able to submit the claims right now so uh for now i'll be um i'll be actually looking into this further and we'll give you an update on monday alright okay sounds good thank you thank you tamara have a great day take care"}}, {"id": 161, "data": {"call_id": "1622815988.129762.txt", "text": "please enter your access code the access code you entered is invalid you entered 22 hello hey chris how are you doing good who's this this is josh hi josh sorry i didn't know your voice yep uh okay uh so let's see also be online in a minute okay what's gonna try to get out around 10 temporary okay so let's see okay i'm just gonna attempt to log in from my side um could you make the ipad the presenter uh let me see yep alright oh okay uh this happens sometimes probably to join again but uh should i just wait uh we're gonna move from michaela and asif well i'm sure we'll start with gossip and okay we'll get out when she can okay let's just make sure alright i'm just gonna wait until asif gets here then uh then started that that'd be fine uh also chris i wanted to ask uh andy he took care of the forms right yes we looked at those so i can pull up the demo module and look at the forms too chris i created a user on the test database but i don't seem to have the settings module um could you provide me that access let me take a look hold on yeah hello okay is this is this josh josh and chris hello we're here josh i gave you permission let's see if that works chris josh thing like literally in front of uh uh my seat right now so if he speaks a little louder i can probably hear two voices one from outside and uh so josh you need settings or ehr settings on here uh the normal settings as long as i have those i should be good yep i think i have them uh 1 second and oh i have ehr i think right now yeah is that what you want or not i know i needed the other ones so i could see the duration because uh you guys set up the forms like you wanted right because you can set them up uh based on appointment reasons you can set them up based on uh like the frequency can be adjusted you know all of that right so right now what we're trying to do and we'll tell them on the demo what we're trying to do is to give them an over so right now all the forms need to be visible so that we can we can show them that this is possible and maybe go through the demo like this when and and again this is a prospect so we want to show them what's possible with the system so maybe when you're showing this describe those elements uh on there or or maybe the combination of you and michaela you can describe that there that you can look at the forms based on the appointment types or whatever you need to do right mhm yeah i just wanted to actually make sure uh they're properly in the frequency is uh just that i think yes uh and he's already taken care of it it should be good but i couldn't actually verify so i just wanted to be sure before we started presenting sure uh first can you give them the i gave him settings are you good or not josh am i missing something i'm just gonna have everything i'm just gonna reopen 1 second okay um given the other user i mean whatever he needs to find yeah you got it okay okay awesome students and kills joining in around eight minutes or whatever okay couple minutes yep that's what she said i'm making you presenter again uh one second i'll have to join again i think the ipad disconnected one minute okay mhm okay there you go um you can make it presenter now okay i guess everyone can see the ipad now yes alright yes let's go in then uh here we are so uh this is what's gonna look like you had start then you go into check an appointment the new registration is available if they are looking to get patients in but yeah they usually just have to follow the workflow for check in since they have patients with appointments after that uh you have the option to scan driver's license or enter personal details scans driver's license will only work if their social security number is entered in curemd then we come up with date of birth i already booked an appointment in the system uh with the user so i'm just gonna use those details and as you can see if you get blocked up you have an appointment the next point comes up with this information if it's already in it'll just show it if not they have the option to fill out uh the ethnicity race and if they have the social security i mean on the demo josh josh on the demo when you're doing this you know for for this kind of stuff to you know they they can see what it is right i mean you don't have to go through the entire motion of uh you know ethnicity race and all that kind of so just just tell him this is what it is and you know what yeah that makes sense okay um generally speaking have you received any support calls later related to the kiosk or have you know of any issues issues related to this they usually work flows are the only things people get confused with workflows sometimes uh they do just call in regarding a few glitches they can't log in that's usually when you know deployments happens so yeah that's usually linked to that i just reported they usually get it fixed uh within the hour sometimes awesome okay and uh here we go to add an insurance as long as they put in the relevant policy number you have the option to take a photo off the front and back of the insurance card i know you're saying my screen so first photo um second photo we should give you a card what you want my insurance card no i don't uh i need like a a sample card from the internet that yet you know chris can uh josh can use to demonstrate right i mean we can print it out and yeah i'm checking okay so this is what the first custom form looks like obviously you can type in the checks are already there and yeah once you're done typing in their info just hit submit which falls off the consent form hm okay place your type your name the sign below is this the area where they can manually type in their name you think please type your name to sign below because the the signature so uh it's because the signature will auto populate over the that's fine because i'm not sure if you know these fields are needed um if you might need to remove them these are basically text field so um if you want to enter in the name you can but not that i mean yeah not really yeah because i wouldn't apply for the name there as well so what about signature physically signed yeah yeah yeah for you i agree and that's where this pops up so you can put in your name as an example now this will get into the system automatically for all consent forms whoever the flag is so we can go into the system to see what it looks like for this patient let me go in and uh let me see if i can make myself to present her now if you josh this was perfect so if you can remove that additional text field uh that was popping up in there let me do so if you know how yeah you can um we can put in the game there if you want that we can put in the flag for the patient's name if you want that they're otherwise we can just leave it blank uh yeah we can just leave it you know what it's fine it's not a big deal that's fine and chris you could uh sure the curemd make them to presenter i just want to show you what the signature looks like looks like it's changed a bit from the last time it's not populating on the flag area it's just appearing at the bottom of the form i'm sending you an email with the to an image of the front the back of the card okay yeah the signature for some reason isn't coming up on the flag area is coming up at the bottom of the screen of the farm which is fine okay as long as long as it is i'll just i'll just remove the uh i can remove the signature and the box there i guess and just leave signature at the bottom so you know at the bottom of the page signatures coming anyway it doesn't make sense okay yeah just tested out so at least something pops up in there we can cover during the demo and maybe get it fixed later mhm yeah works okay yep so yeah i guess that's pretty much it alright uh christmas when we have on the call we need to decide on what to do on the portal versus this right i mean what to show on the portal a new registration versus this uh and customer is being filled out over their consent we're doing this over here i mean this is actually much better uh the the uh the ipad version of it than what we do on the uh patient portal you know on the patient portal absolutely sucks so obviously it kind of is hard to sell it is available yeah uh so uh it's it's a tricky business yeah so yeah the only part if i if i might uh if i could just say something regarding the patient portal the only of limitation is that you can actually use chaos on the go like the patient portal the only plus side the patient portal has is the patient can fill out all the information you know sitting at home rather than coming to the office so that might be also something you might want to take into consideration no of course i mean they're looking i mean just the the comment that the customer gave us was that you know this is the 21st century we we don't want people to um hand fill forms and bring that to the practice we want them to be able to do this usually not having to print and sign into that kind of stuff unfortunately on the patient portal uh the functionalities kind of messed up when you're initially signing uh so we kind of have to deal with it i mean present our best face forward but uh and and then promised to fix some of these things later but other than that there's there isn't much that we can do about those uh right now um anyway so josh i i believe we're good um of course we need michaela to kind of coordinate the demo um where where we what what yeah i think she said she's trying to get off the other call okay do you guys still needed she's not available we can all join in later josh we are good this is this is this was good alright then um i'm gonna be exiting that and uh you guys need me later at 1.30 right that's correct alright i'll join you guys then alright thank you no problem okay

try to override this with the provider details but it seems like it's not updating so let me actually report this to my development team because i think if this was some you know which at the time of recording that transaction from the back end this can be actually fixed from the back end because from the front and it's not allowing me to override this provider field with uh mr uh i think it was kaffee yeah fernando kaffee yep so when i try to because normally what happens is if anything did not got saved in the first place you just go back to the same charge and you resave that appointment once you resave the appointment a new log is generated against that appointment and the new provider or whatever changes you have made does reflects on the charge however i think there's only the problem is is is only with this particular appointment everything else seems fine so this is something that can be fixed from the backend and i'm really i really appreciate you calling me back because otherwise we couldn't have you know um located this particular discrepancy for me it was like i resave the charge i went into the report but maybe i forgot something to run maybe that which is why it did not appear at that time however let me report it to the development team and i will get this fixed for you and once we i'll give you a call back it should have doctor cathy's name on it okay okay great i'll get back to you do you have that i'm sorry i was just gonna ask if you had an eta only because the practice manager coastal is um wanting to close the minds and we can't close until it's done i mean i cannot say anything i mean normally the eta for these cases not more than 24 hours like if i reported today it should be probably done by tomorrow if not then it will be delayed until monday maximum not more than that but i mean i i do have a work around i'm not sure if that's gonna work for you but there is something you can certainly do to you know uh get this done however you won't be able to reflect that on the report what what what we can do is we can export into excel and we can have a doctor cathy's name there like we can modify it on excel but that's not gonna give you the pdf format that you print from curemd application so that's just a work around yeah i can i can let her know that it belongs to doctor cathy um and see if she wants to proceed with her month end reports and go ahead and close soft close the mind and then when we go to fix it we can reopen it fix it and then re close it yes that this is something that we can do certainly you can inform it that you are you are aware of where that appointment belongs to and uh once it's done you can just simply soft close that period and wait for us to fix it from the back end once it's fixed you can reopen that period fix that payment and then hard close it okay okay that's one thing i just wanna do i just want this appointment to be it's an original form before i report to the development team so i think my screen is a bit frozen it's not allowing me to do anything it's the anydesk it it becomes problematic at times so uh which page are you on currently can you see the the appointment page the charge page no i'm on the i'm on the charge yes okay so since i'm gonna have to re correct so to save the time you can do this for me you can simply um can you do can you see where it says insurance and there's a double error on the left hand side right under james fuller written and pink color okay just click on that and on the right bottom you'll find resource can you please select it as ultrasound and resave the charge for me yes okay let me know when you're done because this is how originally the appointment was saved so that the backend people could know this is where the problem begins okay done i redid it yep perfect alright okay dana thank you so much for your time i'll report to the development team and get back to you with it with an update by tomorrow okay alright sounds good thank you so much thank you take care bye bye"}}, {"id": 166, "data": {"call_id": "1622653669.1250203.txt", "text": "hello this is tabitha hi tabitha this is blake from curemd how

second alright thank you also let me check the utility it's running it is not do you have a new update for the no there is no update i am just i'm assuming that probably for some reason utility was not running that could be a problem let's see it's working okay well apparently the utility was not running for some reason maybe thinking better has not been restarted in a couple of days or something i see which is where is the utilities of the service ah see it's it's not been restarted in 14 days there must be some you know files stuck in the system anyhow so the utility it's it's right there on the computer over here so it just needs to just in case if it's not running so just just double click on it and it just starts running that is it and it goes over here hold on a second let me see oops this is this is your utility yes that's that's the utility yes okay so let me do it on another machine and see if that's the same issue utility this uh icon must be on all the computers this one so tell them to uh the best thing would be a that they should restart the computers and the message here the message i have here on another machine this is uh okay so uh where is where is the icon there is a program for this utility alright so what happens is what happens is that let's say if the utility is not running over here the system if as soon as you click on the manager icon the system first downloads the utility it must be downloaded over here uh you see this this one over here so actually the system keeps on downloading the utility and the users did not know how to run it and all so they just keep on downloading and downloading the utility so because the utility is already installed and uh good in the computer is only that it was not running that's the reason it was just keeping up doing this so i understand that this this this computer uh i see the utility running on a trade okay now i have another computer that i don't see any utility icon on its rate how can i how can i install that double click on this do you have any icon of utility on the computer uh double click on what uh on the on the home page uh no no no on the desktop let me take you there this this icon this one this one right here is fine okay hold on one second let me see where that is let's see if that's installed on another one so this is uh CureMD clients republic okay hold on one second let me pull up the computer so okay i double click on that and i have running okay now it's running alright but most of the times it is uh it gets stuck or it's not running because the computer has not been restarted in so many days and you see this computer has not been restarted in 14 days now you can imagine how much of data is there in the memory so c 4.2 is his like so just

ask edward um okay i just uh confirm from edward we also do not have data from carry o and we are also waiting for c c d a files from practice fusion okay i'll follow up with both i thought they will send it to you today okay okay then we can wait for today um and then you can follow up so that we uh can um define the timeline without the data availability we cannot uh define the project timelines because it all depends on when the data is going to be in the system so did did they start building anything i think i shared with them whatever i can last time yes um edward said that he tried to export the files from practice fusion but he was unable to so we are now our only option is to get the data from them export which file practice fusion he said that he tried to export files from practice fusion for the the c c d a files sometimes if uh we also access the system and try to export it um but we were not able to he has i think written in the email that he sent to you okay yeah he sent you an email on 19th that he was not able to export the data on the name you're talking about the right client i'm talking about practice fusion this conference will now be recorded i can share my screen with you you can read the emails on my screen yeah hold on 1 second yeah this is uh this is what he told me to send them but they didn't send anything yeah no they haven't yeah he didn't have any difficulty this is what he told me to send please send this email that he didn't have any difficulty i didn't even try now this email says that as we were we are having difficulty and exporting so we need your assistance on this so which means that we are waiting for data from both vendors alright so now um i'm gonna go back to give me a minute please let me get the database ready okay so um the purpose of this call is to talk about all the workflows that you perform in your database so that we integrate or configure if anything uh that is not there in the in the application by default uh because by default there are all the standard workflow that available to give you an example for example not every client hold on one sec sure just go ahead okay so um yeah so this is uh to help us understand that what are the things that we are going to cover in the training session what do we configure and what is it that's not needed by the practice for example we have some calendar views and some practices they needed other practices that don't so we configure the database accordingly we will also discuss a little bit about the chemo staff that uh what is their movement who does what in the practice so let's start with the staff members first um there are 3455 staff members added in the database it's um angelina fisher sharon catherine yourself and andrea go ahead please there is an additional take out andria and uh there is a different nurse okay can i happen okay you send it and she's kim owners or the the regular ness no human okay okay and sharon is a receptionist she's um taking care of all the front desk correct okay so would you do you have an insight on what does sharon do from start to end as you scan print um electronic filing e faxing um referral what what what are her major responsibilities who uh sharon she handles everything except um medical except like uh medical systems medical so she does everything except all the clinical and the medical stuff she has been the only employee for a while she did everything got it and does she send referrals to the insurances and receive them and update them and who does prior auth she does okay and she also does prior for for all the chemo patients too correct thank you and catherine and angelina and the third one these are chemo nurses no angelina is um uh physician assistant and um catherine is a medical assistance and can you help me understand what does angelina angelina do physician assistance okay so she is taking respect sometimes um in in uh practices is the the the tasks are kind of different for everybody i understand that uh all the physician assistants they take care of the patients uh vitals and take review of systems sometimes nurses do that too so i was going to understand trying to understand so that i can design the training session for them accordingly so being p a does she also receive the patient after the patient is done with the front desk i'm sorry what was the question so once the patient is done with the front desk staff the patient comes in and sharon takes care of the patient for the uh consents and referrals and everything then patient moves to so then okay catherine takes care of uh the patients sometimes the reason i know uh maybe it gets confusing but the reason is sometimes in some practices amazing they they kinda exchange their duties and whoever's available can perform um so can perform the duties of m a and m making perform tasks of uh maybe front desk sometimes so every staff is designed differently and that is what i'm trying to understand so if it is like this is sharon does strictly front desk and ma does strictly nursing and uh then pa does strictly p a and then then i think it's more of a straightforward thing and then we'll design the training session for them accordingly so i talked to sharon does everything and uh catherine is supposed to do uh m a and uh she needs to be trained on both m a and the front desk okay okay i will also be part of all the front desk training sessions so that's taken sometimes checking patient or take care of all the things in absence of sharon yes got it and the third nurse with the chemo nurse um she will be um so chemo is something that you will you and the chemo nurse or you will be documenting it in the system uh maybe you'll take turns or maybe you'll divide the tasks so how is the order creation gonna work are you going to write the orders on the paper and give it to her and she's gonna enter them in the system or you will enter the orders in the system directly i think the plan is to put it indirectly okay so you will be part of uh all the training sessions or just for a mas and the chemo's for me yeah why do i need to be part of the m a in case uh you would like to add the patient record and if in case she's not available or if you would like to look at the records is that typical for physicians sometimes they sometimes do that yes but it's really really it's really up to your uh design your staff design it's i'm sure it's different so that is what i'm trying to understand if you do not do them a um taps or m a then if what training sessions would would you like to join for the provider note that is strictly for providers and the chemo order sessions these two sessions are strictly for providers other than these any other session you would like to join i don't know really what the you know the to make it easy just um send me a proposed um on an excel sheet or whatever spreadsheets proposed um plan for the training and i can sign off whether if anything needs to be changed just send me a standard um let's put into other practices okay i have an excel sheet with all the with all the agenda of the training sessions and if you feel like you would like to be part of any of the session um you can mention your name because we do not want to miss out any of the staff that is why i am having this call beforehand so that i designed the plan accordingly otherwise we'll end up dispensing one training session maybe for three staff members differently or maybe when you when we send you live somebody tells us okay i was not trained on this and i was supposed to so that is what we are avoiding so now i'm gonna ask few chemo related questions that do you build for you do you build solutions that you use for drug mixing and port flushes yeah you know i'm yes um the the just to do the standard you know i got it if that's what because we just do the standard for all the other practices okay and what is the average number of chemo administrations that you perform per day i am currently not doing any anything like this i haven't started yet so you will you will discover this as you go so administration will be performed only by by one nurse who's the chemo nurse and you will send me the name for that and how many chemo chairs do you have 4 thank you okay so one important question is about drug protocols so would you search all the drug um or the regimen from the library or do you have a custom library or custom regimen that you have and you would like to add them in your favorite list i only use n c c n regimens okay so you will search from the library or do you have a list of certain regimen that you frequently use the library is nccn right yes it is yeah so just the library in some positions um they have this custom list but if you would like to use and search from the library sure it's it's it's available at all times and do you document hospital administration hospital what so do you have the scenario where the patients will be administered in the hospital the drugs will be administered in the hospital and you will um documented in the system some of the documents some of the administrations will happen outside of your clinic alright i'm sorry i didn't get that i probably will need to do that okay so these are all the chemo questions i have few but um as you said that you would like to have that standard format and then you will change if needed or maybe you will discover it on the go and make the changes and i have the training plan for um the sharon and lien catherine and the chemo nurse now what i'll do is i'll send you a training discovery sheet right after the call that discovery sheet contains the list of all the training sessions we're going to conduct plus the agenda and if you would like to set any of the training sessions or if you would like to group your staff members then you can mention their name so it will be one sheet will be divided into a few you can click on let's say for example if it's front desk you can go to the front desk sheet and it will show you the agenda for that alright and then um and for your follow up item is that if you can follow up with your um legacy mr to share the data as soon as we have it we'll kick start the training sessions okay okay so thank you doctor for being part of the call and i'll keep you posted on the project progress okay sounds good thank you take care bye bye"}}, {"id": 183, "data": {"call_id": "1622656293.1251507.txt", "text": "hey uh uh linda yes yeah linda this is ryan again from curemd support uh

for a test patient per say or uh yeah just another way you know just to give just to see if it does come out the way it should be okay probably i think a test patient won't go through since if if they don't have a number associated with that but uh uh yeah that might be it but if let's see if you can schedule one per say if you have another user or maybe one of anyone in the practice maybe who has a user if you can just do one for like we won't even like schedule it it's just like more of just having that pop up appear mhm mhm i am trying okay there we go we got it yeah there we go we're

okay okay now the check amount is 34 212.76 right but um it's supposed to be uh with everything $340,525.22 so it's it's over 53 2 46 can you please repeat that i'm sorry um hold on let me make sure that i'm saying that right yes the whole uh the whole check total um is supposed to be okay so you are uh you're actually concerned about that uh the actual check amount out is 345 to $5.200 but why you have received the remittance for $34212.76 correct right okay is is it the same check number yes okay well that is very strange let me check a few things because because um always are sent by the insurance and um uh we don't have any you know uh we cannot change anything uh with that but let me check on the back end that how we actually received the check in our system okay um because if if uh we have received with the lesser amount what i'll do is i'll forward your concern to the relevant team and as i get any updates from them they will actually give a call to the insurance and i will update you okay but let me check um while you're doing that we did find a payment that was for the actual amount but there wasn't anything wrong with the the with the payment like there wasn't anything wrong with how that one was posted but we did find a payment that was $4-$312.46 what is over um we didn't see that there was an issue with that posting and we tried to take it all back out and re posted and it's still giving us the same so you're saying that you found out the explanation of uh the check and you have posted the payment manually but uh you're still concerned about that why you haven't received the correct era right um if you go to the next page i think it's on the next page yeah right there that's 30 12 yes and we and that's what exactly what it's off by and we tried to unpost it and repost it the thing is uh the thing is that the era which you have received is of this much amount do you see the amount which i've highlighted yeah so in actual we haven't received the era for the rest of the amount okay so you're still missing yes the same amount which you were able to found for another patient we are actually missing the explanation for that uh it's a it's a coincidence that uh both patients uh may have the same payments but uh we actually haven't received the era let me just calculate one thing yes we actually haven't received the remittance so for that uh 300 and uh $12.46 so what i'll do is i'll forward it to the relevant team let me uh check a few details so just give me a moment i want to check a few details is this the check date yes okay i'm just uh writing down all the relevant details which my relevant team will be needing in order to investigate this okay so the check is the check for all of these locations or for one particular location do you have any idea about it um it should be all for the same for the same um one everything so that's all the same tax id number uh well actually that's just for the mpi ending in 2657 the ones that ending in 2657 okay that's the only thing that's on um here for this for this check that check number it says mpi 1245 so that check is issued against this npr right yes and i think you can just use the one that says okay okay uh no problem uh the thing is that uh i'll forward your request to the relevant team as we get any update i will give you a call back okay but as of now that same amount just has not been posted yet right yes because you haven't received anything for that much amount and no explanation as of now okay can you um send that update in the um in the ticket yea sure team okay uh what i'll write down is i'll write down in the ticket that uh you haven't received you have received a remittance which is incomplete okay and uh we are also informed that we have forwarded to the relevant team they will contact the insurance and they will uh datas and i'll give you a call okay and i know we're supposed to be getting another one we normally get em on wednesday so we'll be getting another one tomorrow but that shouldn't interfere with this one correct no it won't interfere it will just because you have already posted like uh all of the check so it will again appear with just one explanation one patient and the the check okay so alright no problem thank you so much for your time and i will update you thank you have a good day bye bye bye bye

the start time and the end time it's uh nine o'clock to six o'clock 9 to 6 alright tuesday thursday yes uh so we have days as well yeah so tuesday wednesday and thursday tuesdays and thursdays only perfect when wednesday too wednesday too alright yeah so what did you guys build the calendar for us well uh for starters we will help you set up everything and while we set up our training session you know after this call we'll walk you through on how you can utilize your vaccine management system within md and how it is working on the novel health platform and after that you will be i'm pretty sure that you will be able to you know set your calendars by yourself and you know you will be able to manage everything but if you come across again uh if you come across any concern or any question um i am here to help you out and here to help you out so that's not a problem but how to create calendars and how to manage things we will take care of these things in our training session which we will you know conduct as per your availability um marcus too we would like to have our appointment folks and folks cancer in archival vaccine line just that our scheduling appointments to schedule them directly into curemd so i don't think at this time we don't we won't be using the online does that make sense so hi this is blake now uh jamie could you explain that a little bit to me to for me to understand sure so um the process where you like submit a link to us and the person can go and register themselves that and register everyone ourselves and okay for calling you a regular appointment in our clinic okay so basically you don't want to enable the link for the patients to schedule their own appointments not at this time that's fine that's that's an easy thing okay yeah alright alright awesome yeah thank you blake all right so um do we have you know uh different locations for this as well where you will be administering the vaccines like uh or if it's just the county it's just gonna be here in our health department yes alright awesome perfect and um for the vaccine codes we have those okay and for the fee schedule do we have the updated fee schedule or are there you know that needs to be updated yeah i went in yesterday and put those admin codes in our fee schedule the 2021 fiscal year awesome so they are updated already yes and those kinds of also been added to our immunization program awesome awesome alright and for this purpose since you know we will be using this as an automated process so um for the vaccine no template do you have one already created or you want us to create one for you because you know uh for the automation process we have limited the no template to you know uh very certain things we cannot fill in you know the whole details in it so we do have one template that can be used for this but if you have already you know in your no template library you can let us know the name of it and i can review it and let you know what can be you know changing that so um we have not been entering a note in cure you're um so far the only thing we have currently is our regular immunization no template for like vaccinations and things like that we don't have one specifically for covid all right not a problem i will then create one for you guys and that will be you know used in the automation process it will have the immunization details in it the diagnosis you know uh and the procedure so these three things will be added in that uh note that i will create for you and then do we have any consents that you would like uh from the patients while you know getting vaccinated because the note template or anything include the pre examination questionnaire um can i can i interviene in here for a second because i don't think they will be using any consent uh because the consent was basically designed for the patients when they're registering online if they are registering the patients um you know themselves so if the reason why he's asking for the consent is because if you before you administrating vaccine do you want to the the patient to sign any consent um we're not doing it right now uh we're not currently well you can skip this part then alright and uh another thing here i wish actually i'm not aware of is katapa currently using inventory model uh we do use that but not for immunization alright so we can skip that but would you would you like to use it for the immunization or no how hard is it to get it set up and to use it like then well it's like climbing the first ladder um is this gonna take a little bit getting used to i i must say that so if you're not comfortable to you know add the vaccine and the inventory module then you're gonna have to print a bar code it's it's not that much of a big deal but it may delay your goal life it depends because you're gonna have to add all the vaccine large number and things like that in there let's get that part okay alright but it is still will the information that gets um crossed over to c v m s where are in where we're getting our inventory reports that will still be happening in occurring as we just back out of cure that is correct okay so as long as they're vaccine report and see cvms is correct yes because there are other agencies who are not using the inventory module but they're still you know getting the data reported to cvms so you know uh that should not be a problem okay and that that that is still like since it happens every night it should be current um it depends on you basically we can do it every day we can do it i'll give an example of an agency so they have clinics on tuesday and friday so they want the tuesday's data to be submitted before friday i mean thursday and then the fridays that it should be submitted before the close of day and on monday but there are other agencies who want to submit it on a daily basis as well so you define and give us the time uh sorry schedule when you want us to upload the data to cvms could be today it could be a day later you just tell us when because we have to feed that information to the bot yeah i would think for us it would need to be by the end of the clinic day yeah it could be daily yeah so how would that work let me just ask this question for billing wise how would that were for example we had 100 people today and i wanted to hold a claim or two because i didn't their insurance information in there do that um so basically if you are administering 100 vaccines a day and all of the documentation is that correct then all of that information will be sent to cvms on a daily basis because the agencies what's the meeting on a daily basis there documentation is that accurate right for example um we're our check in staff we're not gonna really have them enter the insurance information our billing staff are gonna get that and we're gonna periodically pick it up through the day and enter it but say it's like five o'clock and we're our clinic goes to six so those folks coming in from 5 to 6 their insurance information won't be entered until the next morning how do i keep 30 patients from going out oh um i think we could define some rules because all of these rules are you know added before your go live and the reservation to cvms we can definitely add something we can come to an agreement on seven rules and then obviously we'll define all of those rules so you can have things c v m s daily but not insurance um i will have to discuss that in a later call first we have to write this down uh that for example if they want to filter out certain patients to be submitted to see cvms on a daily basis do we have the capability in our robot to do that okay so we'll get back to you on this fantastic thank you marcus and marcus you can send that to josh he will be able to get you the answer perfect alright so i did notice that and i will send it out to josh to confirm on this and moving further here i have a few more questions uh tanya and jamie do we have any rough number of you know appointments that you are going to be seeing per day i mean are we uh like 506 100 no no i think we're probably looking at um less than 200 right now we're doing about 200 appointments a day appointments per day alright that should be good enough to manage yeah alright and we are having madrona pfizer and johnson available um just madonna and well all three perfect mhm so that's something do we need to have a schedule built for friday for all right and um marcus let me say this too we were just talking so like on fridays what we typically do with our agents in vaccines since we don't have a lot of folks who want that we take calls throughout the week and once we get 10 people together with them and schedule them all to come in on a friday and we're talking about schedule earlier so we may need to have a schedule friday just for those that are coming to the health department to get chance sure that would not be a problem here because you know the best part about this is that you can manage your schedule uh you know as per your needs so that would not be a problem for the days for the times or for even you know for a single vaccine that would not be a problem so once we go into the training part where i will walk you through on how you can you know create your schedules and how you can manage them and you will see that you know what i was actually talking about it will be pretty easy stuff for you okay awesome so uh moving forward uh i just have a few more things that i need to confirm on my end and then if i have missed something but they can take over from there so uh the first part is your system require any updates to your billing group repairs that you currently have set up like uh your group and npi which you guys are using do you need any changes in that do you need any adaptation no no perfect alright and for the while we will be setting up your uh you know vms here we will be having an option to you know default defaulting the ordering slash administering provider so do you have any provider in your mind that you want to you know default for this particular you know doctor prices who we typically bill under um for immunizations all right perfect and alright there's just one thing that uh would you like us to assist with all the billing all covid encounters based on cpt once the automation process is activated i mean what does that mean exactly well this will mean that you know for all the encounters other than the vms as well where you will have the cpt codes which are for encounters they will also be part of the automation and we will be submitting those uh you know we will be submitting claims for those in congress as well or you want us to simply go with the uh only the only the ones which actually are being taken care in the vms uh let me explain that to you jammie yeah so basically the automation that we have put in place it it works on the cpt code so we're gonna feed that cpt code that whenever uh cpt code for example for 591300 and then you have uh you know the admin codes like 0001 a and then 0002a whenever these codes are used in a patient chart i mean for the vaccine administration it will trigger the automation so when you start using when we use the word vms basically what we will do is we will create a dummy provider excuse me we will create a dummy provider and with that provider we will attach a billing provider to it so when the calendar is created that calendar you're currently using the resource base calendar is that correct yeah okay so that's the uh vms works in management system these calendars will be created under provider profile and that will be covered in uh you know the training the process is exactly the same apart from a very minor thing so instead of attaching the reason group you just have to choose the number of slots for a number of appointments per slot that you want to book that is why one of the questions that we asked earlier that how many appointments are covid vaccine that you'll be administering in a day will give us an idea when we will prepare your dummy calendar you know for the training purposes and then we will walk you through that you know how to create and the the best thing about this is you can create when you are selecting the you know the number of uh bookings per slot you can create the uh calendar according to the number of slots that you want to really have for example if you don't want to cross the threshold of 200 appointments you can do that there's a way to manage that we will show you within our training what he's trying to say is that apart from the the provider that we will set up within the application would you be an administering vaccines you know with your regular resource based calendar as well or you're just gonna shift everything over through our automation so yes we will also have immunization clinic currently playing with our vaccine clinic okay great now the other part of this is um please help me understand that you guys currently administering uh how many types of vaccines um i would say at least 40 45 no no no what i mean is that types in uh like pfizer moderna jensen are you doing all three of them yes we are okay so in order for you because you earlier mentioned that you when you get like 10 people lined up then you will put them you know on a particular day on the calendar so on friday right and and i believe that is for jensen only yes uh huh alright so help us understand and we will find a way best possible for you guys how would you like to how are you currently meeting all three immunizations on the calendar what is the uh you know unique identify that tells you that this patient is for pfizer this patient is for this one is for jensen how do you differentiate between the time between say a google sheet well she column that has the patient's name and then column beside it with the drop down and it says moderna um first of second does pfizer 1st 2nd does whether or not the patients and checked out that okay alright i'm glad you said that now keeping this in mind we do have a flexible system right now what i mean by that is we can either we can do it two ways first thing is that we can create three uh w providers with the name jensen or advisor or madonna that's one way to do it or we can create three separate locations where the same provider will be uh added and that way you can manage through that so you decide which option is best for you guys either you want to do you want to add multiple locations you know to manage those appointments or do you want to add multiple providers to manage those location providers is an easy option by the way to manage because then you can create the calendars of separately madonna separately and the uh jensen separately as well so you don't have to maintain the google sheet so we can't do on the same calendar on the same day you can do i mean that's not a problem that is not a problem you certainly can do that but i'm just trying to give you an option that would you like to have them separated no because right now we do like pfizer 1st and 2nd dose is on the same days okay so yeah we can just put them on the same calendar but would you like to have jensen separate from the rest of the crowd uh so the the jansen would be separated because it would only be administered on fridays so there should be like a special resource for that one while there go so instead of special resource it will be a special provider provider yeah thank you yeah yeah so yeah we can certainly you know do that uh we will add a um you know uh dummy provider and then we go from there okay all right marcus sorry i sorry go ahead please i had a question too so we'll be going live kind of in the middle of the month like on june 26th those clients that we already have on our legal sheet that are scheduled would we how do we get there demographic data into cure i think i can run a report from cvms that shows everybody that's already came in 21 days ago or 21 8 28 days ago fair enough so we'll be coming back to us for their second dose and we could put those into cure what we we do have an option to yeah we will migrate all the existing well not the past appointment but the future appointments past you go live to the newly created calendar so you can manage all of that through the automation as well because if they came in in the past for their first dose information the same we would just enter and cure that it was their second dose and they're demographic is correct okay being on the different scheduler will not affect their clinical data it will actually help you to uh administer them in a you know effective uh manner uh and faster as well right so really like if a person's checking in if we send that file to you guys everybody that's already been in for a first dose is coming back their data should be in there on the date of june 22nd everybody that's coming in for a first dose we'd have to enter that demographic data yes that is correct so if you if you do want to have them over when you go live the demographic data should be there first thing second thing is you just let us know that they need to be on the calendar you know we can migrate patients from a resource one resource calendar to another you know we do have the option to do that so we can help you migrate the appointments as well so what what type of format would you need that report and no you don't you just need to let us know the date which dates uh you know which date uh schedule uh we need to migrate yeah for uh for this purpose i can share the format the details uh you know in which farmers you know you need to let us know that you want to migrate these appointments from this resource calendar on this particular date uh for you know so once we have those details with us i can certainly send this request to our technical team and they will be going ahead and you know migrating all those appointments so we will not be needing the patient level data we will just be needing an overview uh in that particular format once i will share it with you you will understand so you just need to let us know the few details and the rest of the things will be taken care by us okay so the data will be coming directly from c v m s because that's where we register and do all of our stuff now okay alright but those patients currently on your scheduler for the second dose they're on the google sheet just their name and all the registration information is in c v m s okay in that case you just need to you know get them added in cure and then just let us know that these you know give us a list of the patients and let us know that these patients need to be on the scheduler for this date and we'll get them added okay i think we're gonna be able to do that that way because but they don't have any unique identifiers in the google sheet no but we can get a report but that report isn't gonna match up with the google sheet there's there's no way to have like a patient's name with all their demographic information that comes from cbms connected to how our schedule set up well we can do all this appointment date like 21 days again so since they came in for their first step and have them automatically to june 22nd but they wouldn't come in at the time and like the times and everything would mess up and they may not have been yeah i think we just have some stuff internally to work out because we don't have any fires tied to that google sheet and so i'm just not sure that we would be able to migrate it over the way that the way that we're talking about so i think we'll have to think about that a little bit well and i don't even know that we need to have them on there what do we need to have them on there i don't do that number well but if they're already in cvms if it's their second dose want their information just come up but not caring are we using share because i thought they were i thought there was an interface between the two not until we start not until we start okay that's okay alright sorry we just have some logistical stuff to work through sure not a problem alright so i think that's pretty much it from my end i have pretty much everything that i need you uh need the details on to set up the vaccine management system on my end and blake if there is anything else that you want to confirm you can go ahead and do that um um yeah i think that's pretty much it okay so do you want to cover the ip addresses part uh i did share those i p some of the i p s in an email which i sent to jamie um actually did say that have been wireless and i think i've just sent you another sheet can you just send it over to jamie again and just get that white listed as well and uh and i think if i'm not wrong maybe give me one second maybe i need to add maybe maybe in addition to this we might just add one or two more ip addresses so but yeah if you just get these white listed then we will start the process on our end to check you know if the server is communicating with our server you know for everything so yeah okay that sounds great i can do that awesome so uh yeah i will be sending you an email which will which will contain all of the minutes of meeting that we just discussed and i will attach the ip list in that email as well okay and is there anything else i need to work on on my end that i haven't alrighty then um not that i think of um you just need to work on these it s that we are going to share with you and the other part will be the appointment migration process on how you want to you know take care of that these are the two things that are pending on your end that's that's about it that will work on the logistics of that alright awesome then i will be sure to send you the minutes of meeting email before the end and you can add anything that if i have missed anything in it so uh i guess that's pretty much it and once we are done setting up your process i will again communicate with you on to you know let us know your availability for the you know uh training part so that we can conduct your training and we can walk you through the workflow of our vaccine management system okay that sounds awesome so that's about it for today guys okay great thank you thank you no problem uh we wish you the same as well jimmy and tania have a nice weekend thank you bye bye bye bye bye"}}, {"id": 199, "data": {"call_id": "1622578040.122235.txt", "text": "good afternoon united oncology

hi this is peter from curemd support how may i help you today yes we got cut off somehow i don't know what happened i really apologize for that my anydesk number is seven 44 six 0 five 854 you're not driving are you uh no i'm not i think it's getting windy over here my my fan is on i'm sorry that's ok i i was worried about you if you were driving sorry i can see your screen over here okay now let me go back to my problem here you see this this is patient i just saw and um i had to try to change the medicine and i tried to get rid of these two adderalls okay so i wanna get rid of those so i push on that and look what happened they're not even there i i don't i've never seen this happen like this before but these are here uh in the past i believe and these are um checked over here if you can uncheck these they will disappear okay and click on accept at the top accept alright so current medicine is please what what was i doing there i mean uh some of the past medications were still checked uh as being uh continued but um if we uncheck those they will not be appearing onto the chart if you go into the past i want i want the box on to be in the past two see okay let's try that now mhm i wanna get rid of the box because he's she's on uh public eight so we don't use this one anymore but when i where is the move to the past i don't get over here click over here click on medication duplicate go into past it's checked over here as you can see if you can uncheck this it will disappear well what am i in now with this is this past um yes these are the past medications and we can see uh their status as discontinued over here and prozac was discontinued um yes these are all the past medications and their status is currently discontinued at the moment okay so if i go to why are these checked if they're in the past let me see why would they be checked was um well that thing i'm not sure about because um they are not checked unless someone check those um in the medication section of a patient so if you uncheck these they will not appear on the chart and hopefully they will be remain unchecked for the future uh charts as well well she's supposed to be on this she's got that so i'm gonna accept that can you also happen can you also make sure that you uh renew that medication do you see what happened do you see what happened it changed everything i do see it under the past medication over here if you wanna make this one the current medication for the patient you'll have to renew that if you just go in there i dont think you see the issue um this is all different now do you remember how long it was when we first looked at it and now its gone exactly exactly because there were many uh past medications that were showing up under the past medication over here right now you unchecked all of those except for this one over here so these are the current medications these four of them and um there's only one past medication that we can see over here do you just want to view the current medications then you can move this one to to renew that as well just click on it go under the past medication if you want to if you want this one to be renewed just show up i put them here i put a check if i want him to go current you you have to check these and then you click on the renewal over here okay alright exactly mhm she was still on difficult okay good yeah okay um she's still on self okay so i'm closing it and ibuprofen not um not on the adderal or federal excel and not on the potassium not very large or will she she's not on her okay so now i want to hit renew you'll have to like re prescribe all the details over here for all of the medications but i do not want to represcribe this document that she's on them um all of these medications are the past medications unless you re prescribe them um they have a lot appear as the current medication for the patient for sure i want them to cuz that is what is on uh huh can you re uh prescribe them i mean once you're renewing no once you're renewing the medications you just have to i i believe you have to add the refills and that will um just hit prescribe and that will be done i don't want to prescribe them she has them i've already spent look what i've already sent uh i'm just press no thats fine alright see what i already did was i prescribed pain with some of those things that beyond there and we go up here to the medicine uh i do see the prescribed ones are visible over here under the current medication okay yeah i do see the last three or 4 you prescribed these and these are under the current medication so if there are other medications that you would like for this patient to have um these are these are what if you accidentally i'm not saying i did this but what if i accidentally hit one and made it inactive and i want to reactivate it but i don't want to prescribe it isn't there a way to do that let me check um it's something that i'll have to ask my team to confirm okay alright you want to call me back uh well uh the best way for doing this is to um get you to the right person let me let me let me have uh someone called you on this number okay let me let

see the acknowledge lab results but uh yeah the only acknowledge ones will be able to push like they will be automatically sent to their portal but in order to be able to push any documents into the

let me just do that so like it's been uh the results that you have received are not interface with curemd these are from the outside lab correct no they are in curemd okay so if they're in curemd like you see it's for the acknowledge ones so like these are these the radiology results or the lab results it's it's a it's not lab it's a test it's a it's a procedure yes it would be it's a procedure so okay for that the procedure can you go to access right box right okay and then hit acknowledged the procedure and click on save and then right next to it you see sink right for all portal users and click on that too so that it will send these rights to all so now when all the acknowledge procedure results the patient will be able to see them on the portal okay so so he should be able to see those now when you click on how do we know if those are acknowledged those procedure results are acknowledged though yeah you have to acknowledge those results like mark as acknowledged so when they are marked as acknowledged then they will be pushed to the patient portal so i go into his account and then go into documents and i go into those two tests like the echo and the um that and then where

please speak to beth this is hi beth this is collin how are you very well and yourself i am good as well thank you so very much so beth i just wanted to update you the doctor underwood is successfully added as a provider in the practice okay alright they can start using uh right away uh it's just that since i mentioned in the previous call that the sbi that's the number which is assigned to them was on another emr so i have also escalated the request to shift it to curemd and it will be done within 2 to 3 business days and after that he would be able to electronically prescribe as well i will update you once it's done as well okay alright and just for the information uh with somebody at your end take care of his um user credentials for logging into the curemd application will someone take care of it is that what you said exactly or you want me to create the user credentials and share them with you um the only i don't know and he's not here for me to even ask him these questions right now i guess that you can do it and then share them with us and then he can change the password as needed exactly the only reason is that i am not aware of the exact user roles and the permissions that would be required so the office manager in your practice might have a better idea that what exact permissions are required for doctor underwood you know we don't have an office manager so that's impossible alright so probably doctor can confirm that exact permissions needs to be given to doctor underwood uh i don't know i am comfortable with that so whatever way you you say that i'll go ahead and do that exactly the way it is okay or if you want we can just wait for two or three days and months the spi is available and then i will give you a call back then you can you know let me know if you know what permissions needs to be given to him so that i can create it there and then and share that with you okay however you feel comfortable i'm not sure i don't know how to answer any of these questions so do just make up the password and i'll deal with the permissions things later because i have no idea what any of that means so just go ahead and do the password and and i'll ask them about the permissions thing because honestly i don't think either one of them is gonna know what that means so um to get back to you on that one just for my own information who takes care of these matters in your practice normally there there's always an office manager who takes care of all these routine tasks so you've mentioned that you don't have an office manager so who normally takes care of these requirements in the practice that would be either him or myself it depends on which which what it is you're dealing with i get that i get that no problem at all so i'm gonna go ahead and make the user credentials you can confirm the permissions and once we talk again in two or three days once the provider successfully moved to curemd for then uh we'll discuss about that alright okay alright that thank you so very much for the confirmation and have a wonderful day bye you too bye bye"}}, {"id": 207, "data": {"call_id": "1622656462.1251583.txt", "text": "hello hi this is abigail from CureMD hey

so um if were good with it so i can go ahead and close the ticket yes i mean you guys might receive a few phone calls here and there um but yes everything you can close the ticket alright michael so what i have a few updates for you i want to let you you know i want to inform you in advance so um the current client utility youre installing all the systems so were not about you know within a month or so we will be having a feature within the cure m d application so if there are new updates for the you know utility and improvements so they will have an option within the cure m d application to update the utility so you really dont have to uh you know uninstall the utility and reinstall it on the system so it will it will be done through the application will this be a um will this update be uh part of a different folder thereby requiring a administrative rights it will be for the same uh same folders like the deal file um there will be two changes will be of two sites one is within the program files x 86 um that is not the major part and you know that part is not touch that much um but the updates will be user specific within their own profiles the user profiles which we went through as well client configuration roaming uh c drive so that is the part where changes will be made and obviously they will require they will need to have the access for their own user specific account and i guess thats not a problem uh for i guess my question is is normally i mean there are two ways that a program can update one is where you do not require administrative rights and many programs have that and another kind of update is where you run an excusable on the system and that requires a administrative level access i understand so i got your point um so basically there are two types of updates for instance when our certificates which will be renewed for the um you know features were using within the utility that will be later on so we will be guarding the users through the application hey you have to download this or you know follow these workflows but usually the updates will be through the applications or you dont have to download anything so the application when run in the background and update the files alright that sounds wonderful i dont think that is there anything thats gonna require me to be on site it depends on how much uh you know um changes you have made or restrictions you have and within you know the practice that actually varies from practice to practice but i just want to find you to you know this in advance that this is something which will be coming up um this will be actually an ease for you um for instance there will be a time when even though you have to enter a password so you can for the time being you know open the um read and write access just for the cure m d client utility and then later on close it out and thatll be just for the client utility and they can update the utility without your credentials and once theyre all done you can just even close it for the cure md client as well i see um is that one of the one of the release date for this update um we are in the process and the development phase is complete its just a testing phase which is going on so uh probably a month or so so that is at least the time we actually take into account a lot of things scenarios and um it will be up you know uh it will only be um you know a point of discussion when there will be an update there can be chances there will they can be an update you know um one update within a year or two updates within a year so its not something which which will be on daily business these updates are something which may come along the way or may not uh the reason i ask is that um getting being on site and being there when yall release that update um is probably the only next major thing that i need to work with you guys on and so i would like to be there for the first nurse or first clinician who runs that update because id like to just see it ill go down and make sure that you know um when they reboot their computer that everythings gonna be just fine yes uh that thats absolutely correct uh so um the main thing will be that uh we are making sure on our end that you dont have to enter the user name and password until or unless you have absolutely restricted everything so that is something which is clients you know environment specific we cannot do anything about that but when it was related to things which may come along or access um things we came across a few things and we started those out so that there could be minimal things which may require you know admin access for but it was it will be very easy and simple for the for the users there will be a button on the home screen of the cure m d application update the utility they click on it it will run in the background and update the utility as simple as that awesome i really appreciate your phone call no worries youre welcome thank you michael um so is there anything else you want to discuss today except that youre excellent and i love cure m d thank you thank you michael we love you too and have a good day alright man bye"}},

how are you good good thank you so luke is is timing our appointments uh we're not doing by time we're doing by medical decision uh is this uh the screenshots that you sent it uh is this uh uh the 99213 or the other code was the selected by uh the system or you selected it i'm sorry you're breaking up that code what uh are you selected 99213 right uh huh so uh this is uh what you selected or this is what the system uh told you to do no this is what i selected the system doesn't tell me sometimes it tells me sometimes it doesn't tell me but then you know it writes 99213 but then says office established low 2 which i guess is a level 2 two and then it gets the amount of time which is 20 to 29 minutes right now uh there are 2 things uh one either we can build appointments based on the time or based on the medical decision right so we could sorry go ahead no no no no we don't want time we want medical decision okay so you want the descriptions to change yeah remember we talk about it that it's it was saying time based code and i said no we don't want that and then you said the development team just put it and we're gonna do it but now it's going from time based coder to now doing this change so it looks like it's being billed as time based and we cannot have that time based okay actually the code stays the same whatever the description is so if you are billing a  99213 the insurance knows that you are billing on the basis of mdm not on time but i just don't i just don't wanna see time based there you know because you know i don't want to see it so if that can be fixed because i've been waiting like for like a month now but you know i don't want to change to be worse than it was i was okay with time based you know as a concept but now that it's really timing it and saying you know your billing this level and this is what it is i don't want to see that so if please could be fixed this week i would really appreciate it because i'm not gonna send any any bills today i mean i'm not gonna send any bills until this gets fixed so it's gonna piled up we're not gonna be collecting michael is gonna be upset you guys you know i'm gonna buy yeah so i'm not

no no no so uh this is uh the ticket that you logged in a few days ago uh i uh i assisted you with the un identified users if you remember those yeah and then you told me to look into registration request patients receive the registration request that cannot be accessed by staff yeah so for that what i was able to do and i'm doing it right now for you is so with every single user you have i'm going ahead and updating their permissions so everything from patient portal uh managing request emails and register patients i'm just making sure everything's checked off so they'll be good to go and receiving them uh ends from here on out now when it comes to the telemedicine one the second one for virtual consultations that remarks cannot be added after virtual appointment has passed and it gives you an every time lapse changes cannot be made now i did some research and what i was able to find out is that once the appointment has started you cannot add any comments after that that is just the way it works now i did find a way in which you can actually put a comment in so it won't be as you know the way it is but it's there will be a way you can attach different notes with that so if you would like to see it i can kind of guide you where you need to go and uh kind of show you the process for that okay one second amazing yeah so uh if you wouldn't mind pulling up here any desk for me i am pulling it right now amazing okay perfect let me open up mine as well and awesome and i'll just wait for the nine digit code uh whenever you're ready it is 148 739604 604 604 perfect and uh if you wouldn't mind accepting my request uh just send that over right now okay thank you and uh you guys like to take the lead so if you wouldn't mind less going uh to a telemedicine appointment and try to add a comment as you were then when you were getting that error like for example this one actually this was sent already uh i think the doctor is working on this yeah uh so can you try adding a comment right now just to kinda show me that yeah at the check in and then you put that comment there and it doesn't let you save if i'm not mistaken right yeah okay perfect so put anything new and it doesn't let you say so uh yes so over here if you do it this way through the editing appointment it will not let you do it but what we can do if you just need to put a note or any comments what you can do is let's say if you click on the appointment even though if their date has passed what you can do is for example let's do uh to do to do just one moment just cross this out real quick okay just a moment strange where i'm not getting that over here that one has been submitted to the uh the claim has been submitted i don't know if you're able to do that still yeah uh so you're talking about these ones they're telling me to someone yeah those are all elements but the problem is all of those have been submitted to the claims all this uh purple ones uh huh one right now uh i get that so uh absolutely so it's it's so it won't really do anything with the claims basically what i'm trying to do is just uh finding that out i did i'm just need to reconfirm just so we can put in comments so even though it has been sent out to the claims absolutely they might not get it since it's been sent out but for you it will give you the reminder that there is a comment with that so i'm just trying to figure out if i can look into that so you know for future you can have those notes for yourself over here yeah just give me a moment uh yeah i'll just confirm where that option was where i found that i'll just get back to you i just want to resolve this right now thank you yeah uh in the meanwhile if you want you can use your md i'll just get back to you and then i'll take the controls over again okay thank you hey uh yeah uh thank you so much for staying online so is it okay if i can just call you in a bit i just have to call uh just need to research this and i just need

it keeps pulling up my user name with a capital p instead of a lowercase uppercase b instead of a lowercase p so i don't know if that's probably if that's part of what's causing my challenge is it does it does actually it's pulling up your capital p yeah we have we have to remove that from there okay so and then there's a thing that says manage password should i go there and change that or should i let you do that i can go ahead and do that can you please pull up any desk pull up what any desk so i can remotely access your computer any desk i don't know how to pull that up can you go to the website any desk dot com oh okay yes do you want me to close this out where i am just stay open and you can go to another window and type in any definite is chrome okay yep it is okay okay any desk dot com okay and do you see download or download now i see downloads is that what removes desk or soft downloading yes is that what you want me to push to select your connection is not private attackers might be trying to steal your information from download any desk dot com that doesn't make me feel good right now is it prompting that i've got a big red triangle that says your connection is not private attackers maybe trying to steal your information from download dot any desk dot com so maybe anti virus protecting you to go use that i would say if you're always using it but if you don't feel safe using it you can discontinue um and then i believe you'll have to ask your it to you know prevent this prompt from coming but you know where you get this manage passwords and you are unable to continue they basically would have to go ahead and remove your temporary files and cache okay alright and that would basically take away this problem okay alright and also um i have set up your secret question as my emr and anytime you forget the password and are unable to go in uh it would ask you to you know continue you can click on the secret question my e m r and then the secret answer to that is cure m d all lower case okay alright okay did you set up a new password for your account and you are are you logged into cure md now i have not yet let me see what i can do so i need to go back to the page that said oh and now it's gone where i got to new path set up a new password right i didn't close it and it's not there so let me try my 1234 again 24 log in again and see what if i get better okay now i've got a password new password you want me to set up that same 1234 password there just set up your old password and you can go in and put in a password under new password that's something that you would remember as a password okay now this thing flashes up over here and i think that's where it's maybe the managing password thing is it has update password yes you can go ahead and hit save to that okay but let me ask you something first the user name there has the capital p so should i change that capital i know i'm sorry that's old school upper case t instead of the lower case p okay i'm gonna say save that alright now i'm appear to be in cure md all right that works okay is there anything else i can help you with i think that'll do it just as long as next time i get out and get back in we work again alright okay thank you sir you too"}}, {"id": 259, "data": {"call_id": "1622575479.121682.txt", "text": "if you're calling about a covid vaccine press five thank

already have been looking into it but uh yeah let me get you in touch with them okay i was gonna say they're working on something for us and i was just wondering uh a timeline timeline kind of thing and also i had a question that i wanted to ask someone just for mhm okay and and this is just a uh like a general uh chrome chrome browser migration question i'm wondering um if if there's some point in the process um after which they they will no longer be able to use internet explorer period mhm alright like is there something that will prevent them from from oh working on ie once it's is there something that's done on the curemd side that to to like switch everything over uh past that point won't be able to use it the old way well mm well usually usually the cases that you can probably still use internet explorer but it's uh majorly that uh internet explorer actually might got is uh you know uh service so yeah that might be something they might actually stop support for it so the point actually might be move so yeah that's the only reason why we're you know moving to chrome as soon as we can so it's it's just not supported past support because support has ended we're not supposed to be on it period yeah support has actually ended already as you know so before it's you know totally gone or you know issues to pop up that's the reason why we're actually moving you know everyone over to chrome so uh yeah that's usually it probably could still use it if it's there probably but um it's usually better to you know just move over and avoid using internet explorer yeah i agree i agree um the the reason i'm asking is uh just to so like we're we're still using internet explorer right now and they were working with us last week to to get things going on chrome but there was a problem with label printers uh configuration of label printers and uh that that was a sticking point and that's what they're working on right now for us uh but i was wondering if there's you know if there's something that uh something that they have to like some switch they have to throw on their end that will activate everything that needs to go on in chrome and at that point are we uh no longer working on ie because right now we're we are we are working in ie yeah absolutely yeah you are yeah you are probably working because of the label printing yeah i know that's uh something our team is working yeah it's definitely you know working on the label printing it's just heard over actually you know trying to get over but uh yeah hopefully we'll get there pretty soon now um chris i think is available to talk to you so yeah i guess he can answer you know your questions further i'm gonna transfer you along to him okay thank you sir no problem mm mhm mhm mhm hi tom this is chris how are you doing hey chris pretty good um just wanted to touch bases with you i um i guess we didn't we didn't speak with anyone yesterday so i was kinda curious at this point i guess the clinic is kind of limping along in i e and um i was wondering uh if if you guys uh could give us like old status uh synopsis of what what our status is and uh what we're looking at okay um basically we had the details mhm we had a detailed session with uh brandy yesterday and um we looked into your scenario so initially we provided a document with all the details for the required configurations and he requested on the document to log the support tickets once you're done with the installations so that we can further guide you through so um this is actually the way we were taking it forward so um somehow uh you already transferred yourself and started using chrome labor printing and scanning but we were not informed that you were going ahead with the transition so basically our design of the model was that once you are done with the configurations we will then further look into your devices and the paper sizes you're using and we will guide you through along the further steps now since after all the session which went yesterday we figured out that the paper size which you are using is basically two by one uh which is technically the utility does not support because it's a different thing is totally different uh browser and this specific browser actually support few things which were present within their act within the active x which you very used within i e but uh it has its own way of doing things so we figured out the paper size yesterday and um then i told brandy to log the tickets so that we can continue that process and i forwarded the key to my door open team uh that uh to provide you with a possibility to print through that paper size uh the two by one and so that we can get everything up and running within chrome okay so are you guys are figuring out the two x one thing on your end and do you know do you know if you know if brandy has already submitted a ticket because i don't i don't think she's at work today she's uh i think she's taking the day off i know she told me yesterday i know and i have requested her on the email chain i have requested her on the email chain that hey brandy please log a support ticket so that we can continue everything in documentation because that is the best way forward i can provide you the data you can share me with the data and that's how things will be in a smooth way so that's why the ticket's out there uh i can give you documented official responses from curemd uh that that will actually help you you know guide everyone around in the practice that how should we move forward okay can you can you tell me though if she has already uh opened a ticket do you know or um i told her to open the ticket yesterday on the email chain where she provided me the details i did not get a chance to explain to her you know with the details which were there in the documents uh that uh to log a support ticket but i just told her directly hey brandy please log a support ticket but that's fine whenever she comes back she can log a ticket i have already forwarded this information with your specific paper sizes see the paper size is the only trouble here we officially never recommended two by once we never recommended currently never recommended this paper size and now since i'm switching clients to chrome actually every third or fourth client is using it un recommended paper size and then they're saying that hey we we are using this and we have been using this but they never came back to us asking that what are we supporting what paper size do we actually recommend and support um so basically our situation though boils down to she needs to be working through a ticket um continuing with the migration uh yes meanwhile i have done my part uh whenever she's back she can lock the ticket but i have forwarded this concern to my development team that uh penner county is using uh two by one paper size uh those the utility is basically designed to pick up two paper sizes for three x 2 and three x one which were provided to us by z by themselves they because during this configuration and chrome switch we were in contact with the you know our windows just like zebra and they recommended us the size is to be the best one to work within chrome so actually speak of zebra um and another story entirely there uh there they've been a thorn in my side for quite some time now um do you uh what do you do you have any recommendations as to like the the vintage of driver versions that we need to be dealing with with the zebra printers because i know they're they're kind of they're not real mainstream they're good printers but they're not real mainstream and they've all know kind of a pain i've always been paying for every it i've known things do you know if we're looking at using those uh do we need to be on the most current version or is that something that you kind of recommend that we stay back on a stable version um to be very honest um the thing that work is the best one to move forward with because there are so many zebra models uh now then again the the second thing comes up is that um uh the model we support is simple a g k 4 20 so either way our most mhm could you repeat that it's gk 4 20 t t uh t j yes tt four t okay so um yeah um so basically uh that is the model we support and with the paper size of three by two but since uh you know clients have been there from the first day and they have been modifying active x and they were able to do a lot of things which were not recommended by directive x but since this whole switch came along there were a lot of things which you know clients really you know been carried they say hey things are running so that's why another model or that model of zebras so i have like a list of more than 15 models different various models of zebra which clients are using as of now so i already gone um we we really don't want clients to you know change their zebras or discard their labels wastage of dollars so we want to come up with something so that we can assist you and get things along the way you have been using them okay um do you do you so as far as could you do me a favor could you uh resend an email and um to uh brandy and please copy me and uh indicating that she needs to be working uh through a ticket please please please uh remind her that she needs to open a ticket concerning the migration and she needs to be working through that rather than directly through uh blake and you guys i guess because we did we did give you a you know we kind of threw them so uh we got a trust me yesterday i was scheduled sessions yesterday i had a lot of sessions with this chrome switch i'm dealing with actually all the counties and um when i got free and you know they told me that things are not working in vendors so i went through my list and i told them that never reached out to us according to the document and they should not be switching without letting us know so then i went on the screen share session saw the paper size and i got the issue right away that what is the issue and um since we have enabled chrome for all the users now we had a different technology back then now everyone can go ahead and use chrome and and you know without uh letting us know of course we used to enable the users we got that done uh you know in the last uh two months then uh we have the backup plan as well like you can use meanwhile we get things straightened up so for now you can just request the users to go ahead and use i so okay so that was that was the main thing that i called you about today was i wanted to i wanted to verify that there wasn't like a point in the process beyond which we couldn't we absolutely couldn't use i e and i wanted to make sure we hadn't crossed that point because we're you know we're still using it right now correct so eh and we want you know until we can get the the until we have time to get the crime thing straightened out and we have everybody in one place right right now the you know everybody's off for the getting ready to go home and stuff like that so nobody's in the clinic at this point and there's uh not much working directly on it today with them but uh we we wanted to make sure that they wouldn't be left high and dry if uh that point had already been crossed as far as the crime migration goes we we actually i have worked on this point with the development team myself to have a backup plan for chrome since we were coming up even can you imagine i even have gone through some of our clients which are using some labor printers i've never heard of they were using within i e we never supported but the activist somehow did and i was like okay i never heard the name of the company you're telling me so we came along so many scenarios this is something i'm just pulling out my heart that we never expected that clients would be doing this sort of things customizations without letting us know so we went back to our development team to have a backup plan for scenarios just like which happened with tender so in the past if you would have done that then users will not be able to use i e anymore but we have actually created a functionality now that the application with you know detect the browser if it's i e it will go back to active x and it will use the old set up and if you're using chrome it will use the new utilities so that is now in place for scenarios like these so knowing point in time you will face any problem with switching users back to ie if you come across any issue in chrome okay so uh bottom line is right now they're they're good using both uh they're they're not totally good using crime yet but they're good falling back to e yeah we got that done and trust me it took us a lot of time to get that done because it's the structure and the quantity is so big that we roll out if you roll out just one thing we have to roll it out for all of our clients and we need to make sure that what we are rolling out is fully tested and good to go so we roll it out for the scale of all of your md each and every client now has the capability to switch back to e anytime they want and use the active active they find anything policy within um chrome that's that's that's good to have a plan yeah yeah yeah upset but but yes will you uh just uh in general would you mind would you mind sending brandy and i can email reiterating that uh she needs to go ahead and open a ticket she needs to be working through a ticket um he was very angry yesterday if i'm gonna touch her she's gonna kill me she's she's kind of cool like that not one trifled with brandy no i don't wanna try brandy so i knew her in so many years now and you should see her supervisor yes um okay so if you could do that that would be great i'll look you in i understand i'll just loop you in within that email chain so that you are updated with that whole process that would be extremely cool too i will do so can i have your email address please uh yes it's uh t stetler um t s t e t l e r and uh just in case that's um tango sierra tango echo tango ah lima echo romeo at county nc dot gov same as same as brandy's got it so i'm just gonna repeat what you told me it's t s for um sailor um then t again then e then t again then l e n r yep you got it alrighty okay sir i will make sure of that and i would like to tell you another thing um we are coming up with the feature to for you guys to be able to customize the label uh within chrome or customize the margin see you'll get a preview box and if you have you know other types of labels small labels or different labels which are not recommended so we're just coming up with that functionality is just like a change request so um it might take a few weeks to develop and get that up and running so that you know you can go ahead and customize uh you know also incorporate customization within the label printer margin set because that is the only thing which is missing here in all of this uh issue is just the margin set nothing else um okay i understand that the now uh as long as she's aware of the timeline she's dealing with i you know i'm i'm kind of i'm that's not my wheelhouse so i'm i'm glad the functionality will be there and and we'll have a fixed but uh just make sure she understands what she's i explained to her i explained to her i told her uh everything yesterday when uh she came in and she told me that um we are adamant to use the same paper size we're used i told i told her that we we will come up with everything and it seems that we uh kind of missed one part which was logging a ticket before switching to chrome which caused a lot of trouble on your end um but that's okay uh we will now proceed on a ticket whenever she lost it and we'll take it from there okay sounds sounds fair enough okay well i do appreciate your help and uh we'll be talking to you again soon sure i'll look forward to it okay thanks sir all right you're welcome bye bye thanks

of my locations with all users at intermittent times so it completely kicks them out it freezes and it's for longer periods of time anywhere from like 5 to 15 minutes okay so it is interrupting the workflow because the providers are trying to see patients and they cannot review any of the records or any of the patients information i understand so this has nothing particularly to do with when you're adding diagnoses is that correct no this is the entire system just shuts right down and it's all locations it's not specific to one location alright perfect so Tina as I said that its been

and do like other stuff on the providers behalf if that makes sense so yeah so this is kind of like giving you like authorization to do partially stuff on the doctor's behalf like you know like creating notes and all that kind of stuff right yeah mhm and location that would be yeah so for which locations do you want this account to work with so oh my god that's allowed i'm not even gonna get into that but yeah so i hope you understand that that's for that and that's for that read astrick when something mandatory yeah pretty much this uh we don't use that much but um willing to if that's applicable with you so yeah uh for example if you create a user you have this little option if you ever want to deactivate it as simple as going here back un checking this saving it and yeah it's done so permissions it actually gets a little bit more precise so uh i would highly encourage you if you have a minute throughout the day go through all the settings so it'll really help you on really understanding so this is from everything from adding a user to making changes within demographics to pretty much giving permissions or anything yeah as uh the tab is so yeah that's pretty much it so you just create a user from here uh fill out the asterisks if you wanna give them more permissions you can mess around with just going through this tab right here and if you ever wanna deactivate the user you can always uncheck this and click the save option yeah and just one thing i would really highly encourage victoria is that usually it works with other websites but like for this database like it just make sure you click the save option as you're aware because you can fill out all this and if you click on any other module without clicking this you have to do it again absolutely just so just a heads up for the future so awesome so that's how you add a user and deactivate it so since since we're over the call victoria anything else i can possibly assist you with anything else no i believe that was no my pleasure victoria and if you have any other concerns you can always log a ticket in and it was a pleasure assisting you i hope you have a wonderful day my pleasure bye bye victoria thank you bye bye"}}, {"id": 269, "data": {"call_id": "1621976832.1059356.txt", "text": "you have reached the answering service for doctor miranza single for quality and training purposes this call

okay it looks like this is a smart scanner which means uh it's only going to work with the hp's own software as i think i did have a conversation with you before basically it does not support wayne compatible or windows compatible virus it can only be scanned through hp's own application so right now we are running this application this is owned by a hp alright so i'm sure it's gonna work because it's better go through the h p s own application okay so what you're telling me is that i can't use it to scan directly into cure md actually it's this is a status symbol that the scanner is only going to work with hpe own software okay okay so i can use this kinda to scaner come straight into cure md no not straight yes you're correct however you can scan it from here from their own app and then you can scan or upload into the cure md oh yeah i know that but then i was just trying to cut out that and just gone straight in so if i can't do it then we can close the ticket yes unfortunately scanner is not compatible but i can double check on the h p s website let me double check hold on um i'm fine using the app okay that's fine uh it's uh 9020 okay well let me just have a look just give me one minute okay yeah just check the manual of this hp drive it doesn't have any twain compatible set up so you you're going to have to use it directly through the app okay okay okay

sudden it just disappears meaning uh nothing i can do make the cursor won't show up okay so basically whenever you're creating a provider note uh i can't type anything in i keep tapping and tapping and it doesn't come up i see can we try that um can we do a screen share session okay when i say we also please visit or i think it's an internet explorer i think that's what you have me set up for okay got it okay let me just um let me make sure i have this all in here alright so now what do i think it's on internet explorer i'm pretty sure it's internet explorer okay so now what you do alright i need you to please go to okay um you know give me i need anydesk access now so just open anydesk if you have it already otherwise downloaded i know the curses there it comes off and on it doesn't yeah yeah it doesn't it's on right now but then it goes off okay so now i gotta go to google chrome sure go to any google chrome anydesk i think we've done that before so it's gotta be in here somewhere anydesk fast remote desktop app yeah okay i don't know if we've done this money download now i think we have this already but downloaded anyhow yes okay okay oh is he already okay she says here open okay um 492207844 492207844 okay connect yes just accept it now what do i do are you there yes i am okay but i put you on speaker but okay let me put you back on speaker i'll put you on speaker how to make the volume louder this one's a little bit yeah can you say something sir hello yes i can hear you okay great that's what i just did get the uh yeah i love you call them and see an email they sent some dying adams 40 of the letters adam mckay's there's a phone number listed there i just want to make sure that my account's getting started to speak to me i want to use my credit card information did it go no it's just open um can you notice that i i am just trying to do something but it's not letting this what's happening uh yes it does cursor it doesn't pop up right okay so it happened to you also but then it does after a while i keep banging around and it does can you log into chrome real quick just go ahead and um log into google chrome the cursor is there i mean i need you to log in on this computer uh cloud oh i've never done like that give me one moment let me log into 12 just give me one moment cloud12 go ahead and log in please i know it happens sometimes in my my laptop also um i think there's a lag time between my trying to enter i was gonna call you about that but i never i never on my laptop during the daytime so sometimes what happens i get this lab where it takes like 30 seconds for it to reboot again on it's own it's bizarre understood does that happen to sometimes um not really and that's what separated here it is working looks like here it's working it stops it will stop working right now it is working can you save this i just wanted to check something okay now let me check so do you want me to go to cloud 12 on google in the future instead of the internet explorer that was on my desktop let me just i will answer this question one moment i'm going to test a few things and here for some reason it looks smaller how do i make it bigger than print you can increase is there a way of making the whole page bigger like the print bigger weird looking i shouldn't have done that sorry that's okay um because when you're using the mouse uh will not be able to control and uh let's just focus on this particular and i will just check the other stuff you know you mentioned i'll check the note phone side how do we edit a note which when it's already saved by someone like for example like the doctor lee it was definitely oh okay but for some reason it's not letting me edit let me say to me so you know what this closure is not coming up that's the whole problem you see how there's no curse what so that's the problem i'm having so you're having the same problem you should be able to but i'm not able to but eventually it'll come back up again okay so you're having the exact same problem i am having definitely and i should be able to do this okay let me try new notes i'm just trying to myself okay let's i'm just okay now this one is working so cursor shows up now so now it's working but it didn't do it before you see you see what i'm saying i understand are you asking me something have you have you seen this problem before uh yes i have seen on a couple of uh accounts so that's why i'm actually doing some research so that i can you know forward it while you're working okay uh yeah sure the computer on it i'm doing okay okay okay okay um so it looks like i'm sorry say that again looks like i will have to report this to my domain controller i mean the main team and uh we will have to you know reconfigure a few things okay so the other thing is that while you're doing that i want you to do two things um as you can see the cursor doesn't come up for you either so it's not just me it is something with my maybe my login or whatever on my laptop i have at least a 32nd lag when i try to click things in it won't go on even the cursor shows up does that make sense to you like the cursor comes up by typing vision is and it doesn't come up and then 30 seconds or a minute later does come up okay uh i think it's the same issue uh let me just okay alright so how do i what do what do i do now uh you can keep keep doing it and because it's a little better and uh i will keep you updated by a ticket and you will receive an email uh notification you will take care of this for me yes i'm forwarding it to their products uh control team what they're going to do they are going to reconfigure some things and after that you should be able to you know work on it okay okay so i'll pick you up you're welcome alright you have a wonderful day bye"}}, {"id": 285, "data": {"call_id": "1622815628.1297314.txt", "text": "thank you for calling resurrection clinics unfortunately the person you dialed must be on

christy this is phil calling from cure md how are you i am good sir thank you so much for calling me back no problem i actually called at like around 1:30 but uh someone from you practice told me that you were on the lunch so um i told her that i'll give a call back yes i do appreciate that thank you so much no problem how can i help you okay so we're due to the system so this is the first month that i've had to do end of month report okay and i'm just a little confused obviously we knew that um you know some of the information was gonna be a little wonky for this this month just because we are moving you know some charges from our old system to this system so it's not gonna be 100% accurate but when i run a monthly summary under the end of day when i run it for all locations and all providers i get a number which matches the number that i have for the amount of bank deposits that i've made for the month but then when i run the same report the same search by criteria but all i'm doing is changing the location and then running it per provider it is i'm coming up with like $300,000 more when i do it individually um so i'm very confused on why this is not working okay uh let me check let me open up your practice okay um because uh there are only a handful of reports which we can reconcile and as you already um you know know that um it's your first month so the reports may not reconcile but let's check that uh what is going on with the reports just give me a moment okay thank you so much it's actually loading on my system kindly bear with me sure no problem so you're saying that uh once you run the end of day uh monthly summary right yes that's what i've started with for me in my summary i'm actually repeating your concern uh just from uh to check if i understand it correctly that if you run it for all the locations it's all good but when you run it um for providers like per provider it's not coming up correct it's 3000 more when i run it per provider and i write down those totals when i add those totals up they don't equal the same amount is when i do all locations and all providers okay so which it should as far as i understand i mean i'm going to run the report location all provider all um and then what should be the date of service um we're going by from 51-531 and i was doing transaction date because i need any money that was posted between those two okay let me check uh does this report take time to load no not usually uh can we do a screen share session real quick my system's acting acting up real slow tell me when you're ready i'm ready 128171 eight 20 uh 128171820 right yes mhm okay i'll send you the request i can see your screen okay let me take the control five months 35 okay so are you reconciling uh the payments yes just payments right now is all i need the charges they're outrageous i'm not worried about that right now but the payments i need to reconcile the payments and that total there the 950,000 that matches what i because i also keep an excel sheet of every dollar that comes into this office so that matches what i needed to say but when i run it per provider it gives me like 1.2 million okay uh let me check and i that's why maybe i'm not running the report right or whatever it is so i have done i've done this bank deposit thing also is it showing up the same amount no when i run it through the bank deposit the amounts come out fairly correct um sorry i had to move my scanner so when i run it through the bank deposit i ran it through here for all the providers and it's like maybe a couple of $100 off but it's pretty spot on but when i run it through here it says one of my providers only had $58 but if i run it through the other one it says 46,000 that's why i'm confused i don't understand what i just don't i guess i don't understand the background to these reports so that's why i'm not understanding why it's pulling such different numbers yeah it's like a couple of $100 off that's fine as long as it's 950 something i mean it's never gonna be specifically right i mean that's fine down to the penny but if you go here can i show you something yes please okay so if i go here my my boss likes to see each provider by location this is the problem that i'm having but at first i was just trying to get each provider period so if i do this doctor here this is all that's showing but if i go back to this month i'll i'll just ask you one thing over here um okay now when you do the billing on the charge page like you selected the rendering provider you selected the billing provider there is a small check box on the charge page do you know about that yes okay do you check that box or do you uncheck that box uh the physicians put in their own charges so to be honest with you i have no idea what they're doing how they're doing it okay so i was ticking both because i have noticed that sometimes they're not both in there uh what was the provider's name which you selected that one azeez okay let me run the report like this so you're also saying that this is not possible right yeah i i mean i've never seen it like that before this would be a first for i just don't know if they're doing something wrong i came into the game about 3 4 weeks after they came onto the system so i'm a little behind i've kind of taught myself most of this stuff that's why i'm like i'm just trying to check all the discrepancies so that i can do some research on this sure no problem uh do you put in the payment date while posting the payments yes okay now the dates of service if you're running by date of service that may be correct because i know his first charges for march for may didn't even go out to like the 17th or 18th so he may not have any payments for his may charges but he should have payments for his april charges you know what i mean i do understand yeah so that's almost like i've never seen it this little um can i put you on a short hold and i'll be using the system as well sure okay please stay online bye thank you for staying online uh well according to uh my understanding uh i think there's some reconfiguration required from the back end from the development team because these are the two reports which do reconcile the payments right and if they're not reconciling it then there is some issue from the back end right because so what i was gonna tell you also is the end of the year this yearly summary so i saw you run the monthly summary for him and it was 20 some thousand and then if i run the end of day yearly summary it comes up with 46,000 which by the way is normally what he should be at that's why i'm confused on what's going on how are you running it so the yearly i've i mean i've literally tried like every report in this thing i think because i was so frustrated and trying to figure out why it wasn't working but we did may through i just did may through may buy transaction date from just him i did it for each physician but this has 46 but the monthly has not the correct amount right exactly but we've only been live for five weeks so if this is saying 46 and the bank deposits only saying 58 something ain't right just keep it right there it's it's really like it should not happen just keep it right there this report let me run a report on my end as well just give me one minute okay thank you for staying online well yes i can see that uh there is some reconfiguration required from the back end so give me some time and i'll be able to give you an update within two business days so uh we'll be able to give you a call back by day after tomorrow okay and so that's that's perfectly fine i appreciate your help but just for my peace of mind that end of month that monthly summary report and the deposit the bank deposit report they should match correct okay i'm like reports which we actually rely on okay okay yes thank you okay i thought i was losing my mind i was like maybe i'm missing something okay very good okay this is you know it's a software and sometimes uh there is a coding a lot of coding behind it sometimes reconfiguration is required so what i'll do is i'll forward your like concern to the development team and once they do their research they will fix it and then i'll give you a call back and i will we'll reconcile it okay very good and then you have my email also feel if you need to just email me anything that was fine i know that uh someone over here in cure md have your ticket you logged a ticket right yes i logged the ticket but kurt was my direct contact um prior to this and kurt is my senior in the team and um um i also work on the billing concerns for all of the clients so i'll be taking care of it and i'll reach you back the day after tomorrow and i will also acquire your ticket which you have logged so that we can communicate somewhere awesome thank you so much phil you have a wonderful evening and i look forward to talking to you as within the next two days right now on friday that's for sure either it will be resolved or i will give you an update on friday that what is happening okay thank you so much no problem thank you so much for your time you have a good one bye bye"}}, {"id": 289, "data": {"call_id": "1622568962.1210675.txt", "text": "hello hello good morning i'm here okay perfect i'll give it to hello good morning hello good morning uh mr imran arman hi hello sir uh sir my name is ryan keller from curemd and today sir i will be carrying you out with the training for your uh front desk and if you have any questions sir please make sure you can stop me at any time and uh without further ado mr amran if you are ready i would love to get started uh yes amazing so uh mr arman the first thing is uh that we use in software called any anydesk so this will allow me to see your screen so i can help you and uh train you accordingly so by any chance mr arman would you have anydesk installed on your computer hello hello uh angelica so you are gonna do the same for arman today yeah somebody arman uh i was just requesting if he has anydesk on his computer because i would just need it to uh follow along and train him no problem so let me go ahead and show him because he okay yeah that would be great thank you so much which means that they can take over the computer and kind of service okay yeah we are gonna put anydesk yes here you go to the download go ahead and give me one second okay it is gonna be alright er i will take it and then you will update it maybe not change oh yeah there you go now you i will put the old one and put a new one so that is become yeah hopefully your password now just make sure you write it down for your purpose exactly so the way exactly that you found me logged over there that card you are gonna log in here let me see if i can continue to anydesk uh excuse me okay just give me one moment i will be right back okay uh just putting uh yeah just give me one moment thank you sure no problem no you just hold on every time we open up anydesk this is the number that you are gonna be um they are gonna be asking for we are just gonna download it it is gonna hit this session sure no you do not write it down because it is always gonna be a different and then i am gonna leave you alone because he is been a committee and then just if anything he can go ahead and go get me or whatever he is gonna show you how curemd works so what this is is that he is gonna take over the screen and then you guys uh i am sorry to cut you off i am back just let me know whenever you guys are ready okay i have the i have the code for you now amazing yeah i can take the code whenever you are ready angelica so it is 774 138 138 538 538 amazing and i have just sent a request over in angelica probably gonna get it in just any moment then you just hit accept alright can you can you see his mouse now amazing yeah i can see it right now awesome um brian is gonna walk you through it if anything go ahead and and go get me or if you need me and then i am in the front i am just sitting here okay okay hello uh mr arman just let me know sir whenever you are ready and i will go ahead with the training sir amazing so first of all i just wanna ask how is your day been so far sir how are you feeling mr arman good thank you just my first day definitely i hope you have an amazing day mr imran so without further do here we go now the first thing uh mr imran i would just love to mention is uh so lets say you just logged in okay this is the first screen mr imran that you are going to see now this screen is kind of like your homepage if that kind of makes sense so like you have your facebook homepage you just log into certain social media websites or could be any place how you know you get this default page so this is yes this is our default page mr imran uh now when you log in this is exactly how you are gonna see it uh so just two things i wanna cover and something you just have to remember mr imran the important things these options uh can you see my mouse move mr yes definitely amazing so on this page all do you have to remember mr imran are these options till here 1234 and this these options till here underneath the tasks now i will get into this right now so lets get it started you have logged in so in messages mr imran as it says they are just like messages you can create a message send it out to people within the office is pretty much that simple now what i will do is i will show you how that is done now lets go and i click on inbox now whenever mr imran you have to send out a message we will click inbox we have this composed option and when we click on compose you can see we have a message when you click on that mr imran you can see we just have this very common basic looking uh text format you have to pick out who you are sending this to what is the subject great thing is you can also attach a patient lets say if you are messaging angelica you are like hey angelica i just had patient this coming so you can click on this and it will give you a list there is no list now but uh later on when you do have patients you will get a list so you can attach a patient and if lets say you have any attachments like hey this is a document i am sending angelica can you please look into this or so you can attach patients and attach files themselves over here you can write your message and it is as simple as sending it over now lets say if you do not want to save it you are working on other things you are very busy maybe and you want to come back to it if you click on save as draft right next to it it will go into the draft same thing send messages mr imran they are gonna come in to send if anybody sends you this message you are gonna get it in inbox anything that you have deleted mr imran that is gonna come in inbox archive and anything that you sent and then you deleted that is gonna come over here so that pretty much sums up everything in our messages box any questions at all on this sir mm that is simple great that is great to hear now lets come down to the task part mr imran now very simple yet again as it says mr imran task is is pretty much telling somebody like messages tell people within the practice hey this is what i need you to do when you write it task are pretty much the same thing you tell people within the practice hey can you do this for me can you do that for me or a reminder hey nine pm do this you know so how do we do that we click on not started and we get this page as you see we have this option with a little plus to add a new task we click on that and then we have this page that is very simple there is not a lot even though it looks like it but it is actually pretty straightforward mr imran title hey what is the task about it could be very something very simple i'm just gonna go with an example it could be as simple as i need coffee okay so that is a task uh telling somebody to get started now i put the title in what is the status of it now lets check out what this has to say okay so it is in progress completed complete and height other you do not really have to be concerned about these ones uh mr imran because these options are for the people who will complete them okay got it yeah so whenever you lets say you are starting the task right so it will always be not started because you are the person making the task the person who gets the task and then works on it they will change it to in progress okay and if they complete the task is gonna be as it is complete so i just wanted to go over those settings with you yet again mr imran uh imran you have these options here do you want this to be on high priority normal low then you have hay which date are you starting on you can select the time as well uh lets say if you want this task to run but automatically end itself after a day or two you have the option to do so over here mr imran in the type option if we select that down these are basically uh types you can choose yourself like uh lets say if you have a certain type you always want to like do makeup by yourself you can click that but this is not like really important with this okay this is just like something for your own internal knowledge or use okay and in notes notes pretty much yeah just i coffee with no sugar so uh if that makes sense mr irman uh arman that is how it works so title and then just let them know what it is about assigned to myself mr arman if you do myself uh and you click save you will actually get this to yourself over here i will show you that in just a moment so assign is to only you all is to everybody in the practice specify is to maybe one person now if we click all right now you do not have anybody here but uh that will change but in all you can sign this to everybody specify you click this little plus option mr imran and then you can select the person and be like hey can you do this task and that will go out to them only so that is how it works and associate patient yeah so this is if you want to be like hey i need coffee to lets say i click the plus and i have ryan keller here okay so i need coffee sending this to lets say it is ryan that is me and associate patient lets say for ashley okay so i need coffee coffee with no sugar to ryan keller associates patient ashley i need coffee with no sugar for ashley now if that makes sense mr arman this is how it works you can also associated patient if that patient has something to do with the task lets say ashley can you check on this patient or can you please check on ashleys notes can you please check on ashleys last visit history or it could be anything but you do have the option to put a patient in there now group task over here this is if you do check this any person assigned to this okay if anybody completes this before the other person the task will automatically be completed so group task is a great option on having multiple people work on the same task if somebody does it sooner than the other person great the task is completed so it is an option that we do provide just to make sure that if there are many people working on this this can be done as soon as possible so that is how you start and add a task that is how you sign it and you can as i mentioned also associated patient remarks as it goes uh you can put in any remarks as you want but that's pretty much how the task uh feature and module works by itself any questions at all on that mr arman anything at all i am sorry what was that mr arman i am really sorry uh sorry i was not able to get that can you give me one second please oh yeah yeah sure take your time brian i am so sorry just give up yeah that is alright uh you said a few moments or minutes uh hello"}}, {"id": 290, "data": {"call_id":

maybe let me take a look because this would affect both your laptop and your desktop if the permission yeah we're not there yeah yeah that's what i was thinking that this was log in permissions not your device okay uh miss and um the folders hm his folder was restricted and oh nia nava hm let's see and and it's happening with all of my clients my old ones and my new ones i think oh okay i think i got it i think it was due to decline utility now being installed in your computer with chrome you saw there was a download option that i just clicked to get something running that was actually our client utility uh this is actually what we run on chrome in order to provide full access for scanning printing and a few of the documents so i think yeah that was what was causing the issue on the laptop so yeah you were correct initially that you didn't have access on the laptop only due to this client utility so yeah you should be good now can you check any other patient with you know the same issue check if you have access to the folder yes i will do that perfect josh you figured that out so fast uh thank you thank you very much okay alright well you take care and enjoy closing that ticket so you don't have to do anything on monday yeah thanks a lot alright then you have a great weekend bye you too bye bye"}}, {"id": 293, "data": {"call_id": "1622819124.1300735.txt", "text":

fine thank you actually remember we had a ticket for the taxonomy codes were not populating in box 24 j and 33 b okay so i have uh worked on all those claims oh sorry providers added it all depends it took me a lot of time so that's why it took me home with all day not completely whole day it took me almost 1.5 hour to add all those in there so now those are added and in box 33 b i saw your email as well uh box 33 b what will happen the group information of the group speciality will populate now for example because you guys are billing under a group in p i i group you know is uh taxonomy that is 282086f0129 x that's for surgery vascular surgery okay so this is the npr taxonomy that will populate in box 30 db and all the relevant npi according to the rendering provider be it may you know if it is a nurse practitioner regular surgery provider internal medicine provider those relevant and uh oh sorry taxonomy will populate in box 24 j so just go to any patient see if that uh taxonomy is populating there and uh well the the they had to match though the one is in 33 yeah they have to match what's in 24 j so you know what's what's weird too um today i was working my rejections and i had two rejections maybe it's just a glitch or whatever but i was thinking like wow that's a big coincidence because for doctor and doctor bradley i had two claims reject from wellcare okay that said providers npi or billing provider not registered with uh national uh n pps you know npi registry and that's for check in the system yeah for wellcare not for anybody else but and i checked in you know in the system and of course we have the right npi number and it matches so i was thinking wow that's weird but then i said what a big coincidence you know that we're working on the taxonomy issue maybe it's just a coincidence but i no no actually let me tell you we are working on the taxonomy for ambetter not for wellcare so we haven't changed anything in the wellcare set up first thing secondly i will have a look at those rejected claims that find out why those claims are rejected okay now back to the original issue or where we were updating the taxonomy i wanted to confirm one thing now for example i am i'm i'm in the link for ambetter so imagine if we are submitting a claim for ambetter for a nurse practitioner okay the nurse practitioner taxonomy is gonna go in box 24 j because he or she is rendering provider but in box 33 because box 33 bears the information for the billing group basically the billing entity that is the coastal vascular and interventional pain management it has a different npi so if the nurse practitioner taxonomy gonna populate in box 33 b it's not gonna make sense that that that i know for sure that your claim will get rejected for that well i i have seen before that when when sometimes the system doesn't put one at all uh the old system so no no taxonomy code in block 33 but it was in block 24 j so the solution new was just simply copy a taxonomy code from 24 j and we hand wrote it into block 33 and that was okay the claim process so that's why i say that uh i don't know that it's i you know going to be a problem if it's the billing one there i just that's how it always was one thing i want to i want to confirm are you going to submit the claim to ambetter on paper uh i was hoping not exactly if we can get you know them set up this way so we'll just see you know if you say it should be the now angela group taxonomy if possible can we do a quick screen share session i'm gonna show you something hold on let me get to the any desk do you have the number melinda i haven't even got the page up yet it's still loading it's so slow oh killing me a white screen come on man google chrome it's so slow sometimes but it's still better than microsoft edge yeah yeah far better than edge you know edge is the new internet explorer is supposed to be yeah it's so much better it's garbage it's terrible we just we just like to joke around here in our workplace that it's it's internet explorer in disguise oh my gosh come on let's go have you tried firefox thats fast you know what i had it before my other thing and i should do that one again i had my whole computer crashed i lost everything yeah i was real bad about saving stuff to my desktop too when you save it to the desktop i learned it the hard way just like you get a lot of data you know because i was dumping each and everything on my desktop so it was so proud and one day my hard drive got crashed and the tech guy said you're doomed you can't recover the data well man that was there was a lot of that he said i can't do anything about it you have to be proactive saved the data in a different drive yeah you know what should i do yeah i just love mhm okay okay this any desk thing it sh it should be in my programs right because i just google it every time i know you don't have to if you go to your download it should be there already you just open open it up and you previously downloaded press control j j as in jack now on the top there is a search bar search for any desk it should be there oh gosh come on man okay to school i want to open up three different things come on man jeez man like froze up everything so controlled j yeap downloads trying search for or any desk on top there is a search bar on top and downloads yeah i haven't hold up yet finally there's the search bar do you re restart your system quite often or you don't no no i don't that's why yeah yeah i think so because you know i faced a similar problem because it's my uh office laptop whenever i come to work i just simply put the lid down do not communicate completely turn it off you know for a month one time my you know computer started getting really slow so i i asked my it guy that what's happening here so he he checked the status and said dude you haven't turned off and restarted your system for the last uh you know 50 days how do you expect that machine to boot i was like okay will it help and that's definitely afterwards I restart my system every day and it really helps try it i think so yep at the day and i save all the files i know it's a hassle because you know there are so many things open at the day and that you want to start working from tomorrow onwards but you know not everything i'll be honest sometimes keep it just like this but i'll make sure that you know it's done whenever i can close all those files so at least once or twice a week uh huh you can do that on weekend yep yeah yeah that's i should at least okay uh is here but it's not doing anything let me click it at one time it's here a bunch of times because i downloaded it over and over and over just access this is crazy right it's taking so long are you telling me is not opening up is there a bunch of times downloaded it many many times yeah just click any one of a nice doing something i think that that's definitely something with your system because right now you're accessing your system data it has nothing to do with the internet so that the day is making me like you know it gives you a little box at the bottom and then you have to click on it until it like run or open or whatever that sounds like downloading or something should just click it and it comes up right but oh it's half time i get i click on something one of my program and then i get a little box at the bottom and i'm so impatient i get a bunch of times and it only makes it take longer okay so the little box at the bottom and then if i click you know a little down arrow says open when done pause showing folder why aren't you doing anything opening any desk closes opening now finally mine or something okay just have to wait and not click on it huh look at her cure md b time now the time i get this up you know uh meant to ask just seem like cure md uh it times out pretty quickly no it doesn't say it times out but you know you try to do something and it's just super slow and you have to just exit mm no we just i think yes i think you're our tech team actually these kind of thing so if you log a ticket and mention the tech team in there they will do some bunch of setting because you know they also did it for our system as well because you know when we are doing some research we go to some other website and all that so it doesn't time out so they definitely do some settings in the browser it's a browser setting that they actually do so it does not time out the session mm well you're gonna think i'm so silly i just realized right now the icon at the bottom i have 14 any desks open and i didn't know it it's like didn't take over my screen so stupid okay i have the number it's 966 227633 got it yeah my cure md did definitely time out on me to restart it mhm can you accept it have you received any problem message i did i accepted okay hello mm hmm okay i can see your screen yeah i i had to bring cure md down so let me log back in okay you have the control now okay i've got to controls patient profile do you remember which patient it was was that we were working yesterday yes um uh let me see hold on i do have that no worries patient with the long name and the account number 215 68 not one i'm just gonna remember yep so if we go in there now since you're gonna submit the claim electronically i'm gonna show you something for example let's say with this provider i can go into the claim file oh my gosh you know what does stupid to me to tell you that because i forgot this is secondary to auto so i think maybe we'll have a hard time to submit it uh maybe they'll let you do it uh we can try but they have yeah see that whatever it does have to go paper my bad i think so it can be submitted on because you know there is no payment posted from the primary so that's why i know you can transfer the responsibility from primary to secondary yeah um you know what you can do just why do you why you're not building the primary we build the primary but it's a auto insurance like a car motor vehicle and the benefits exhaust it is gonna be paid by the secondary that sound better yeah okay let me help the whole amount everything yes let's transfer this you can do this and like this wait wait wait um the amount is wrong the second line oh sorry it's the 352755 thank you now if you try to generate the claim oh let me show you let's do it let's do it transfer the balance post the zero pay yeah now you see here this is the provider taxonomy okay now the same taxonomy this is 24 i mean i'm i'm gonna tell you in terms of performance so this is 24j over here on top this is 33 bc both are seeing right now i haven't updated anything in the claim uh in their billing group so there's no taxonomy in there anything that's gonna go here it will also go up here let's let's look at another provider let me just delete this one let me show you to find another provider that's that's the benefit of submitting a claim uh electronically so if i'll go there and uh first of all we have to do the same for the other patients that's very kindly so let's transfer the balance from primary to secondary that's only one code so that would be 311 everything is transferred to save it if i try the claim see this is 24 j 363 hours 0000 and the 6 53 b c it is me it is changing it is same as renting providers economy okay so since you guys are gonna submit a claim electronically so i think so this will work for you yeah that's good i i don't wanna send no claim paper they can go electronic i'm all for that so and you know just in case if you're receiving this cob error this uh you know that does not allow you to submit a claim there's always a work around like you can post a payment from the primary and transfer the balance to the secondary or any other issue that you are coming up with let us know we'll help you with it okay so this is now coming back to your second issue you just mentioned over the call for the wellcare claims i tried to look it up in the rejected pocket i can see any wellcare claims while we're you know we were paper paper do you do you know which patient it was yes at uh okay have to give you uh well okay so let me put in the birthday i have an account number on the claim mhm okay do you mind if i take the control so it's still um both of those are rejected 2 25 uh no that's what i said maybe some type of glitch or something because the ultrasound claim went through fine yeah and when i looked in the this place where you're at you know with the three boxes and i looked to see well what does the show you know which um npi number there and it was correct the billing in group nbi was fine fine let me check one sec he has the npi that's correct this is npr let me check it yeah and um the other guy taught me how to check in three places for the np for the rejection reason and one is like here in the boxes and the other one you know where you go to find the rejected claims you hit that little button up there i can't remember where the third spot was um i don't know either but we only know about you these are the two places where you're looking for the rejection one in the actual file and the 3rd 1 in there oh maybe it says it says that says claim history maybe yeah it's it's kind of saying the claim history and here the it has the same information oh okay alan who yeah i was thinking like maybe the referring provider because i never recognized that name but that's not what the reject said it's a billing provider right let me check the rejection one more time billing provider npi not on national plan to provide human operation and pbs that's weird let me check one thing real quick yep i believe it looks like a glitch because you know all your claims are going out perfectly in the same matter and everything i knew that just doesn't make sense uh you you can find you can find resubmitting this one uh electronically as well have you have you have you submitted it on paper yes have you sent but just today i mean it's it's still in my hand here i still have it so stop it electronically that's better okay i just don't wanna have to fool with it again you know i thought well if i send the paper i don't have to look at it again but yeah we can try you wanna check the other one it's it's a different doctor show me yes uh let me see mm that one this one right kevin bradley yep it looks like a glitch because you know all the rejection stays the same i think so you just resubmitted and recently bought electronically not on paper okay alright well i will do that and um so the and better claim should be good now and they can go electronic alright great alright anything else i can help you with no that's it thank you have a good day bye bye"}}, {"id": 298, "data":

you i'm well thank you uh hey man i wanted to discuss the um the the portal the portal thing that we were discussing you did mention that it's working fine uh well i do agree to the fact that the portal is working fine i mean we are able to log in but what i was pressing upon the screenshot that i share shared it basically shows that um a certain rights for a certain user are basically restricted so um uh can you just do a quick screen share session and i need to show you something uh maybe you will be able to help me out with this sure one second uh 49 four 010284 okay all right i mean can you open log into it's not the what's the user name again vanessa janderson 7 81 is this guy still with p b yeah that's the one we all use use this okay never heard p 2021 okay i'm gonna take over okay so when i go here i go to manage office permissions although i did try to play around a little try to you know enable a few options to you know have that certain option enabled but seems like this person is not having like the full full access okay so if i select plan horizon b c b s n j all right and if you look at this horizon b c b s e f t registration disabled right and if even if i try to change it i click on this and i select this gives me nothing it says allows users to register i mean it's just telling me what this option does however it's not letting me change and if i go here manage user permissions i select j anderson edit access does it does it tell you which one is like the main um yes i think it's either kelly or joy there are 3 3 user in total there's uh this this guy k anderson kelly langshield and the other one is joy i think she's from maybe the practice i do get some options to disable perhaps there's nothing for me to enable and even if i try to change it from here like this uh it won't let me do that like i did try this too i like did enable all just so that i can have that one open to but even after i do that you can see est still shows disabled so i would have to ask kelly for hers i guess or the the other lady um joy maybe if kelly can give it give it to us it'll be convenient i think joyce from the practice right she's not from from your side what was the last name hold on hold on let me let me show you joy catherine catherine joy i have no idea who that is probably then you can try this is kelly's user you you can i think you can get a password for that too hold on let me send her email link to it just hold on let me check okay okay so let me check if i go to kelly's permissions just for the safe side i wanna see she has it uh it's disabled for her too mhm but maybe when she logs in she has the option to enable it that's that's a separate side of the story right let's let's see for if joy has it okay b c b s give me something alright we don't have it i mean this user i mean this specific person through which we're logged in maybe it's showing us the status disabled but this person does not j anderson does not have the permission to make it enabled maybe catherine joy or kelly langshield might have it so you i mean you you've seen this area before forwarding to me you can actually check it yourself to make sure that you're forwarding me the right one okay it's under administration you go to manage user permissions or manage office permissions either way you can you know make it enabled or disabled right

you doing today alright how are you doing i'm fine thanks for asking it's regarding your missing e r a issue so we do have two tickets and one ticket was actually assigned to dan dan was actually working on that and the second ticket that i have is for the primary gba missing checks so were you able to find the right p 10 which is actually linked under your group npi or not okay hold on one and that is for the alabama medicare alabama railroad it's medicare yeah okay medicare of alabama well we're getting the medicare alabama i just posted the medicare of alabama are you talking about railroad of alabama i have the check numbers and then you can actually let me know if it's regarding the palmetto or cigna because you have reported cigna palmyra gbm missing remittances and uh yes it's pamela it's palmetto gpa but it's the railroad railroad just like medicare of florida's railroad okay so were you able to find the name as well hold on hold on one second let me get that for you hold on sure sure thanks for holding are you here mm yes tina okay alright um the only other numbers that we have is d as in david d as in david oscar yes 56 yes 890 okay give me one moment and are are you sure like this is actually registered or linked with your group n p i which is 121285 triple 8 180 yes this is i got this from uh my um credentialing writing yes i'm gonna repeat the first perfect so i'm gonna repeat that for you d as in david o for oscar 56890 and that's where railroad medicare p10 yes perfect great i will actually report this to the enrollment team and we'll get the outcome from you so uh please give me some time i will keep you posted on this alright okay and the one that i gave you the d r 25 64 you said that was not for the railroad medicare the thing is it wasn't it wasn't linked actually it wasn't linked actually because it depends what information is being transmitted through the claim like when you submit the claim to the insurance so as for the enrollment team they did check with the insurances at the insurance end and they confirmed the listed p10 is the incorrect it's not the correct number and it's not belong to medicare alabama or like railroad medicare so this is what we advised by the insurance and this is why we asked for you to give us the right number this is railroad medicare of alabama not a florida we got the p10 that d r p 10 from the insurance company when we had to find out where this payment was at this time back in last month and we got all of our information of the claim when the our representative here our insurance rep called i understand that let me see the uh huh go ahead yes so uh tina let me actually get get get in touch with the enrollment team to confirm this one as well because before they work on it they will actually check with the insurance of this specific p10 is actually linked with your group npi or not because if you talk about the submission and if you're submitting under group npi so you will be getting the remittance under the same information under uh the same npi in order to retrieve them from the system so we're looking to this and i'll get back to you okay alright okay

therapies can be scheduled as well we strive to provide compassion care we provide both standard insurance based medical care hello uh hi shannon this is david how are you good okay uh i had a couple questions for you uh first i i said logged into the ticket on the patients that we were talking about last week and again this week and then um the angela choir but the all the dates of service that mhm and you were researching that and we're gonna get back with me on that day and um so i'm i'm following up on that uh sure i actually responded you on all the tickets you locked so uh let me just explain you her account as well just give me a moment so where do you respond to you email that to me i actually wanted to have called on that we spoke to be called because i want to understand it why why it's being sent someplace else and they're not and it's paper claims and and then i've got another one here in front of me too sure just a second i actually called the office as well but uh every time i call i was put to a voicemail uh actually we've been shorthanded this week so today is a little bit better today that's why i'm calling perfect i also wanted to speak with doctor because you requested for a call and uh if you can relate this to him as well that once he's free once he has some time he can call me okay i'll do it thank you okay uh shannon so uh as you know this patient has some outstanding balance open with vital care so when we call this insurance uh to follow up on the you know on the status of the pending claims we were told that you know at the claim id on which we submitted the claim electronically they never got on file with them which is kind of a flaw at their end so they provided us you know uh some information wait wait wait wait wait wait hold on hold on just a minute so what what they told us is that they've never received any claims from our billing office so what we were told is they were being sent to the wrong place that we didn't have the right address that you all were sending it to the wrong place that's what was said to us okay more or less they are right because you know as you know we submit our claims electronically that it has nothing to do with the paper submission so uh there was a bug i can say there was a bug with this electronic transmission you know we were sending the claims at the right pair id that we have in our system but the claims weren't going in their system like on their end they never got on file so when we talk with the representative we were told we were given actually a different address we were told to instead of sending you know electronic claim we should submit them a paper claim which we did and uh if you look at the notes you can open notes for any of the appointment which our billing team member added i dont want to get off this person but i have to go back to that one so basically uh all of them have been resubmitted uh yes not resubmitted but rerouted to a different address at a different mailing address and you can see the mailing address we have added it's p o box 79 arnold md 20102 and they also provided us a fax number we also fax them the you know the paper claim which they requested so all the claims are now on file and uh you know we will get back to you as soon as we'll have a response back from the insurance i am clicking the yellow box for notes right uh yes if you click on the yellow box for any of the appointment okay let's just open for january 12 2021 so on uh my 4th 2021 our ar response states that unilateral care primary does not have electronic claim on file edi acceptance mm which i was telling you about kind of a bug i'm so sorry i opened up the yellow box but i don't see any notes i just see uh inbound patient call ar response follow up visit if you click on the small arrow button right next to the ar response statement there is a small error on the left if you click on that you will find a note added by our team member can you see that mhm and what are they gonna say as far as the lightness are they going to pay on you know because it's january absolutely uh you know uh most of the insurances when uh you know they you know sort of give us a delay in claim processing they do pay us you know or they do incur the interest for late processing but it's something as far as i know it's like for 60 days like if claim goes by 60 days they you know incur some interest they pay some interest on the late processing or they you know uh we can file an appeal for you know for the penalty of late submission but i don't think this insurance cater such request so we have to just wait for them to you know get us back on these claims and uh give us a final verdict because i don't even hear on may fourth and may 12 so i don't even see yeah i mean as far as the patients eligibility is concerned there isn't any problem the patient is eligible but you know with the medical coverage with them the only problem was with the claims which were dispatched as a pair id that never got into their you know in their records so uh we're looking at about a four week turnaround hopefully uh well you leave the what they told us was like 10-15 business days but in which they were gonna you know response back making like two weeks take care they need to take care of all of them absolutely i mean you will find this note against all of these pending claims alright okay that i feel better about that knowing that we get it to the right place so um that's just very very confusing uh and is that because it's a 3rd party insurance absolutely you know when insurance is they you know outsource their some of their activities to a third party this usually happens because not all the insurances are set up on electronic functionality i don't want to accept anymore yeah i don't wanna accept any more third party insurance is and this is one of the reasons i so i'm gonna use it example okay then another question for you on account number 221 05 0932 michael heighten i i have a question on it looks like there it's medicare united american something or other and there's a leftover balance on every uh on 12345 days of service ah and i i know the the april 4th and april 23rd is probably not going to be paid on yet by medicare but the other days of service is uh they're supposed to i think they have a deductible with united american and but why if they have a deductible and i'm i'm trying to see if we've collected on that deductible because they still have they if we collect on that deductable then why do they have a leftover balance on each day okay just a second let me just uh look into the previous transactions which were posted for united american insurance right yes i don't see that every time you've submitted the the secondary i've only seen one submission to the secondary okay well i can see a lot of them like starting from january 4 202 yeah the ones that aren't yeah i'm just the ones that i just see the insurance balance and it was like four or five of them but i'm just noticing a pattern and so i just wanna make sure that the secondary is being billed yes the secondary is actually being builled as you can see the responsible plan uh you will find united american insurance company so the primary medicare is actually applying coinsurance of $13.71 starting from you know jan 2021 and uh you know this co insurances further being you know forwarded to the secondary plan and uh as you mentioned that there the patient has outstanding deductible with the secondary insurance united american that's why they're not paying yeah but it doesn't show that that has that there's a patient balance of other insurance that boxes primary plan unapplied it doesn't show any patient balance anywhere so that that's why i was asking absolutely because uh you know the the united american insurance hasn't finalised you know the claim yet once they will finalize this amount will then be moved to the patient balance so uh what we can do we can generate a call to united american insurance company i will have one of my team members to call them and uh let's see if they were gonna pay or they were gonna cover or not because i can see the outstanding deductible amount for this year which is not paid yet so let's get the response and uh we will move the balance to the patient so that patients can pay us can you can you see how much deductible he has left to pay on the united american uh sure absolutely we can check this okay so you can just click on this uh if you're in the patient's chart the same patients chart just go to the insurance i did hit insurance tab okay uh i did i did all that and i had to do something manually unfortunately yeah uh we can't we can't get the real time eligibility this payer does not offer that so we need to check this from the insurance through call right yeah so uh verify right now that can i don't have a person doing that right now we have to yeah so i just wanted to uh well you don't have to do this we will gonna check this because we have a billing team they are you know liable to make all the calls so i will have them to call this insurance and uh get the exact deductible amount registration great i'd like to know that to see and to see if he has any patient balance whatsoever because um um he's coming in tomorrow morning sure definitely i will update you with in a while okay okay appreciate it so much alright thank you have a good day thank you you too bye bye"}}, {"id": 311, "data": {"call_id":

coming to us from the p h p s how we will load that and process it and then show it out in the portal or do we want to talk a little bit more about the specifics of continuity of care document exchanges and how we drill in on some of the specific mapping for data elements that are not stored in a standard way so that we can make sure that we are closing all of the gaps for the amh three quality measures all of it so i guess i guess sandra if you wanted to start with your start with your introduction on your side may maybe that would be a good starting point i apologize for not not setting that up oh that is okay here i will even be a face um too since we are doing introductions hey um so you are laurie and you work with um population health so all that yeah i am the manager for population health so i managed specifically the epic build team so those are my direct reports and then i coordinate with troys team who runs the interfaces group and i also work with the the data and analytics team so we kinda all coordinate together on population health my team of direct reports are specifically the epic folks so that is my area of expertise um so i am sandy therapy um straight nursing clinical supervisor for health services we are a county district health department and our ehrs secure and i am um one of the super users um as well as supervisor of course then the funniest record has been involved with understands data is involved in yeah and margaret and francis both have um like i my my goal my purpose is to work on the front end of the note or the back end of the note to make sure the data goes so these guys do not fuss at me any little places um so that you know sometimes care sets up things specifically too so i have to figure out you know what is where and where is it pulling from and i do not like doing check check little tally marks on papers if there is a way that we can put in a note and it is gonna pull that is definitely ideal awesome um and then do you know troy and louis um we met them last week i think and i talked with troy or emails back and forth with them a couple just trying to get this you know us on the same page with you guys and then um i see blake is on the call too and blake is with curemd the morning blake morning sandra how are you okay so i i believe it is my turn for the introduction can you hear me clear maybe looks like you still owe thursday sorry i kept talking to myself i did i did yeah i did have an introduction of myself without even knowing so sorry about that so yes um guys uh my name is blake i am with  curemd i am i oversee all the operations and support for the public health team and i see you know a couple of lovely ladies that we met many times and we are just there to help whatever we can in any way awesome okay cool thank you everyone so i will go ahead and just kinda give you the quick story um and then we can talk a little bit more specifics uh after that on the ccd and kinda drill into whatever questions you have um so i am also assuming that you have contracted with access east for uh care management services for your amh three is that correct yes okay great so i will i will talk speak a little bit to what access east is doing in this full plan um but i know that there are a few things that are still kind of coming out with the state that we are still working through so just to um let you know i am not sure how much you have been involved in any of the state calls right now but we are currently escalating up to north carolina um and a deborah thompson will also be communicating this from access east so i hope i am not like spoiling too much on the message um but right now we are not currently getting attributed pcp from the state right now so um and when we are building provider panels um we do not have a specific person to assign and we are currently not getting um like the full full roster of patients like they are still just kind of small files so just kind of that is where we are at currently in our data processing and so we are working with them to make sure that everything is working quite right um but so there are just a few caveats where um if we do not end up having that specific pcp um coming over some of the reports will work a little bit differently and we will have to assign them up at a higher level than that um but that is that is just kind of where we are at with the payers and everyone is in that same sort of boat right now um so it is us and everyone else in north carolina so that being said um the way that it has been set up to work is we will receive these uh what we are calling eligibility files or roster files from each the prepaid health plans and the prepaid health plans should indicate to us uh the practice that the patient is attributed to and then the specific provider that is the one that they are holding responsible for the patients care or what we will call the payer attributed provider and we will receive that information and then we load it from those files that we receive we load it into our emr which is epic an inside of epic we then have those lists of patients available to do any number of things with them um and to to use as a population grouper if you will so when we load them in that puts a tag on that patient that says that they belong to the healthy blue registry um from their their roster file so that means that we are then able to create dashboards and then reports that you can drill into that show us for any of our mh three measures of interest um how are we doing for just this population of patients now when we are putting together our mh three measures are using the measures in a way that it is more of like a managed to measure so that means that we are not building it to necessarily the the specifications that they have laid out although of course that really drives our decisions and is what we use to define like our diagnosis groupers and what the exclusions are but we are actually incorporating the changes in the health maintenance um or care gap frequency that is specific to that patient so what that means is if you have a diabetic patient that is being managed with us and um whereas the diabetic a one c measure really only at a minimum requires that they get their a one c every year just on an annual basis if they are providers decide that they should really be having that a one c checked up on every three months because you know they are up at like a 14 and we are gonna do some aggressive interventions to try to get you back down under control uh that frequency then can be changed manually for that patient and then that is whats showing up in your totals in your dashboard so we are going more to that like uh we are measuring it based on the care plan for the patient uh rather than just to like the minimum bare bones levels of specificity um and so that is kind of how we are managing the patients and so that is gonna make more sense than to what the patient would actually see in their own my chart and what you would kinda see to to manage to as a clinic practitioner as well now um what that does not tell us is you know how are we to exactly compare what it is that the the php they are gonna be measuring us up against versus like what we have there in the system that is their clinical uh outcome version now we are kind of still waiting to figure out what it is that they are gonna require us to be submitting back to them and how it is that they are going to be doing this measurement because as we look at um the the amh three provider manual we are looking at measures that have that national quality forum id that look more to like your clinical types of uh indicators that is more like what you would see in the electronic medical record but we know that the prepaid health plans are still really only going to have that claims and administrative data so we have a few solutions queued up like but we kinda before we put any of that together we need to know if they are going to be using like a heated technical specification or if they are gonna be using one that is incorporating like elements from the electronic medical record so right now um we are putting together one that is like the most clinically accurate thats the one that you really want to measure to and then when we get word from the amh three uh group at the state and from the p h p s on exactly how what specifications they are gonna be using and what it is that they are really looking for us to send back to them on those quality measures that is when we we will look to um write that logic so that is kind of a whole a lot um of up to quality then there are a few things that will report out that are more like use utilization and productivity type of measures um and then there are also some indicators in the note about um those specific gaps i thought maybe we would kind of lead from quality measures into the note if that sounds okay um but what questions do you have about that first part so it is kind of a lot that i went through quickly i do not have any i think we just i mean we are all just trying to wait and anticipate on what they are gonna be looking at um time for different insurance companies i mean just you know there is a lot of moving parts and um anxious to see what is gonna be required sooner we know what is required the sooner we can fix things and move forward so there are a few things that we know that we can get working on right now because um for the amh three measures there are a few where we know that theres data that is not stored in a standard way in those continuity of care documents um now i am not sure if you all in particular are going through the health exchange the north carolina health exchange or if we would be um directly exchanging documents um so your mileage may vary depending on uh how exactly that works um but i can say that there is some specific mapping that we had to do to have discrete values throw flow through in a way that would satisfy our quality department that we have the right level of specificity so number one phq 9 values we can discreetly share ph q nine values and have the codes that we can share um number two is a one c lab values so getting that a one c value so that we know if they are in control or out of control um another one is going to be the hypertension follow up plan which we can exchange it like a yes no level like do you all have a plan for them then there is also fall risk screening yes or no which we can get out as completed um most organizations are not it sounds like ready to really share discrete values on those fall risk screening so it sounds like what is really looking to be exchanges just so like do we have this person marked as a fall risk yes or no so those are just some those are some discrete values that you might look to collect either out of your notes or out of assessments um that you are storing in other ways to be able to get them into the right segments um and matched mapped up to the right link codes to send discreetly um out into the world to exchange data and we would be able to provide our codes to you as well um if we wanted to work on having that mapping so as far as exchanging data we i was under the impression we are definitely we are gonna go through the like i think we have heard that it is not quite weird committing demographic data right now and i am not sure when the rest of it will be available can you give an update on that yeah i can uh get a confirmation on this and get back to you guys later yeah um because demographic information is not quite as much as what we would expect out of the us cdi um do your does blake does does your organization send ccd s that conforms to that new cdi standard um i will have to double check this information and get back to you because i do not really oversee that but yeah i will get the information from the relevant team and get get you the uh required details okay yeah that would be great that is a statute um required um now from the government so and i believe that it was um part of what was expected for the mh three participation of practices so the sooner that we get that information the better um with receiving only demographic information there is really only minimal things that we can do um we cannot see if a patient has had any kind of visits um we cannot display like even the free text of a note uh from your chart like that is something that we can do now um we can exchange problems in the problem list discreetly and be able to show those is coming from your organization um if all of the proper information and tagging uh happens um can i get that in writing about the information that you need and then i can get that over to you um i think if you just search for the hhs us cdi standard from the i think that is from the 21st century cures act that has um at a high level those all of those topic areas that we should be able to exchange okay okay the only reason i am asking is in case if i might forget so that way if i have it in writing i will make sure that it is responded it is yeah it is just the us cdi standard for information blocking um and it is it is in the federal federal government um summary so it looks like here maybe that is something that your organization could to share out um to require for the for your hrh there okay and just just to let you know curemd is the h r for most of the health department that has signed with accesses so if we can get it straight mail and it did not help us with like to and some other forms yeah that would be great um so yeah blake that that really sounds like pretty high priority here um required for data exchange again you know just because we we use that sort of information um there then in the quality measures calculations that we share back out um so in the absence though of that and how your providers and your organization can um see some of these dashboards and information that we are working on putting out um you will be able to log into vidant carelink where we will have dashboards that you can see per hour calculations how your organization is doing um by practice after you have been on boarded onto our our vidant carelink platform um and then so if you see that there are gaps that we have is being open but you have information in your ehr um you can take a proof of that information and then scan it into the vidant carelink and use that to close the care gaps in our system of record um if you would care to use those dashboards to monitor your own performance um and then the risks risks for your organization um or it would be on the curemd uh if we are not receiving more than these demographic information is that um you know our system of record that from which care management is being performed will be less than complete um we will not be automatically updating with new visit information or um problems that would come across and visit diagnosis and visits would then come in um we will eventually get them via claims um so it it just kind of delays the amount of time so in the absence of any of that happening that is really like our fastest best most clinically accurate happiest solution um and the way that we could get some of those discrete data elements that are um above and beyond claims like the p h q nine and the a one c values um if nothing else we will get the information coming in via claims but it has to go through the whole adjudication processed through the p h p s and then get processed and then sent back to us and loaded up into the system um but we are we are using the past claims data to build their histories right now um it is just that it takes it will just take a little bit longer to complete that loop i guess so like when you get your answers you will let us know yes sandy that is correct okay do you know probably what uh more information do you know currently what information to me somebody has like you know what information is currently being shared with the nchie from curemd i mean yes we do share uh you know information with the nichie um i just need to get a confirmation that whether or not we are sending and what information is being sent over for albamar so that i need a confirmation on so blake like we are sending 60 to h i e correct not hl seven sorry say that again please we are sending ccp to the h i e a r instead of not the h l 07 um i think so but again this i have to confirm before i say yes or no alright if i am i am i am insured right now i am under um the c c d a exports and i really think that might be where no the the interface itself is being set under the settings but the the sort of information that is being transferred over i need to confirm that from the lab team because they are the ones who take care of it yeah okay that was another question they had had before you came off okay no problem and sandra if you do not mind sending me a list of the items that you need the answer on from my end that will make sure that i do not miss anything if that is okay  yah we will okay thanks and i just shared out in the chat a link to the health it dot gov site that has the us cdi um so it is allergies and intolerances health concerns procedures uh providence immunizations assessment and plan of treatment care team members laboratory smoking status demographics vital signs clinical notes goals and problems and that is for version one thanks anyway yeah happy to share okay so version lets see that so blake so blake like once you get the information will you um i guess will you just let sandra know and sandra then that is kind of forward that up to us that is correct yeah and and blake cassandras point you will be your your review you will include um all of the i guess if there is other members that are part that are working with access east that are on curemd you will include those as well what do you mean sorry so um sandra indicated that uh i guess other practices in the area or predominantly uh curemd and so if they are a participating member of the amh three then we will what the the changes that you are making for albemarle we will want you to also need we will need you to make those changes for your other partners um in that area yeah sure certainly i mean if you can dominate the ones that need it um i think you are working with m to w as well probably and you are working with craven and i cannot remember maybe another one so you just let me know which ones need that change and we will get it done okay that sounds great yep we can help with that as well great that would be awesome so with regards to next steps do we wanna wait until we hear back from blake and then we will maybe schedule another session to kinda get us back together yeah i think so i think that is what we are gonna have to do and if we need to know where you know what where we are and then we will be able to know what we need to do next sounds great alright thanks everyone for their time if there are any more questions alright no thanks uh laurie thanks for your breakdown of everything that more times i hear it because i have heard like all these words and i just they just do not do it it is like greek to me a whole new language um it really is a whole new language very

that's not true because he is let me quickly check on the insurance yeah let me quickly check the appointment so if you look at the primary insurance which is active right now and it's for b c b s n j horizon and if you actually look at the uh i'm sorry the u b that is for direct access n j so i'm just actually making sure if we do have the policy right policy number being transmitted through the claim and it was actually submitted to the insurance give me one second okay okay show sixteen let's see to this claim was actually submitted multiple times and uh the other one has no do not use and the last submission was actually for h o r five b s n j direct access which is actually inactive right now let me quickly check and the right policy changed it because um my billing managers and not to use that one so that's why we switched it sure i have a question at this point since we're not actually using that plan h o r five b s n g access so i think you don't need to actually consider the u b as well because it's not the right insurance this will be active one now okay well my whole question was i know we were having problems with the clearing house um would that be with the changing the the prefects of the insurance would that be a clearinghouse problem or no that actually depends upon the uh information that will be transmitted through the insurance so i can actually show you what is the actual um i'm sorry the prefix along with the policy number is being transmitted to the insurance we do have only one claim but just for instance we'll copy this claim on fire so we would know what is the exact claim so this is your exact claim and if we look at this so you have the policy number correct in the claim and there's no way that it can actually claim house can actually change anything then it is submitted with its sent through your system when you actually hit the upload button and submit the insurance there is no way that we can actually interrupt anything so information was sent correctly but at this point since it wasn't the right insurance to submit the claim so i will actually request you to submit the claim to the right insurance we'll make sure the correct information should go into the policy number and let's see what happens is the other one uh horizon b c b s n j so you can submit the claim eligibility is perfectly fine i can look at it right away just to make sure um yeah um everything's perfectly fine please do not consider the old u b because it wasn't for the right insurance even so select the right responsible plan on the charge page so you can submit the claim one more time so you have the right plan um added there so the only thing you need to do is 6 eighteen 2020 just go to the appointment date and in the claim section let's see if you regenerate the claim if it gives us the right information and not give me one second okay there we go that's the only claim and uh there you go the right information is appearing and um let's quickly check it's p c b s n j perfect so everything is okay you can submit the claim to the this insurance and let's see what happens in case if they still denying it due to the wrong prefix do let us know i'll ask the client has team to look into it so we can check with the insurance okay okay thank you patricia have a great day take care bye bye"}}, {"id": 338, "data": {"call_id":

practice um i can see users what um months or when was that it doesn't give me a date it just says that i can not actually not go ahead and access users and reset their access this is the way i would call for um for password reset yes that is correct but it basically depends on if the practice is an active practice or an inactive probably the practice is not using the emr anymore and that's the

is kurt from cure md how are you today i'm fine thank you very well good to know it's a weekend i'm really happy today good to know uh in regards to one of the tickets you punched in you stated that uh some of your parkland claims are in the overdue bucket and u'd like to know why absolutely maybe you're not familiar much with cure md yet but just to explain you the functionality of that bucket which is known and known as overdue that shows in the claims module uh the basic functionality of that bucket is that a claim pops in that overdue bucket when it's been 30 days of submission to the insurance now it basically indicates the billers or maybe uh whoever is may be following up with insurances and things like that that it's been 30 days that the claim was sent out to the insurance and there hasn't been any answer when i say any answer i mean the balance has not been addressed one way or the other either you posting the payment or you may be put in a denial or you re file the claim or you write off the money one way or the other when you address the balance the claim will disappear from the overdue bucket uh right now if we see this practice carla j cold i can see uh about 12 claims showing in the overdue some from uh umr united healthcare and he has a bunch of parkland community health plan as well so i can't i mean i can explain that again when when it's been 30 days from the time of submission the claim starts populating in the overdue bucket basically indicating you maybe to follow up with the insurance or or if there's a payment or a denial that you've received that you might want to go ahead and post inside the claim or if there's maybe re filing of the claim required you might want to proceed with that so there could be a bunch of uh actions that you can take after it starts indicating on the overdue bucket but why it indicates is that it's been 30 days from the time of submission and the balance has yet not been addressed okay so i just need to contact the insurance and see what's going on with this absolutely and and there could be a possibility that you've already received the remit or the explanation of benefits and maybe we just have to go ahead and post inside the patient account and once you address the balance as i said the claim will disappear from the overdue bucket okay yeah because we've been having problems with parkland now that they change is been a hassle with parkland yeah previously i agree and it's also been sorted out in the in the recent past that uh we've uh enabled eras to come in as well whereas the electronic submission looks good as well i mean if you look at the recent past you are receiving x electronic remittance advice basically the explanation of benefits and electronic version showing a payments money coming in from parkland so you might want to resubmit these claims like for uh elijah anna and lia that that i can see and the overdue bucket currently so there are claims from april uh and even uh january 14th 2021 you might wanna proceed with re submission or maybe just contact parkland and find out what's going on maybe you've already received a payment on a on a certain cheque so those are the exercises that that that you need to proceed with as of now okay but this claim the data services 6 2 and 528 it hasn't even been 30 days since i sent them no no no let's uh allow me to share screens with you and i can show you or i'm i'm on your very practice can you specify uh which claim you're talking about just the name of the date of service of the patient i mean i have uh here i'm gonna share uh let's let's share screens uh and then i will be able to comment better dora so any desk can you any already 63 0630 70 1701 972 972 just a second i will be with you alright here we go yep i do see your screen and i'll take it from here if you allow me so this is your cure md currently you're in the remittance section this is basically your overdue bucket that has the the the 12 claims and if you if you sort out by responsible plan you will see that the parkland you're talking about are these three claims and these three are present for elijah anna and lia okay alright so uh you can see the dates of service and again it does not depend on the date of service rather it depends on the date of submission of the claim so right now this is showing overdue one day only if you look at oops just a second let me sort that out again with it alright so this is showing just one day overdue one that i've highlighted is the parkland claim and it has the date of service of april 21st so that means this was submitted somewhere around may the third alright and from may 3rd to june 3rd it's been 30 days and then uh today will be the first day that it's overdue so it's it's newly populated here in the overdue bucket and you can always see the date of submission of the claims as well i want me to show you alright so you go ahead and to claim history and here you have the data so i told you it might be submitted somewhere close to april uh i'm sorry may the third but you can see the exact submission is may 4th is 31 day uh month may 31 days so from may 4th to june 4th it's been 31 days so after 30 days it popped into the overdue bucket and today it's been just that it's it's one day overdue 30 days over the 30 days exactly so the overdue over a number of days that it's showing you here that's basically over the 30 days time how old the claim is and as i stated uh maybe you've already received payments from the these payments for these patients and dates of service from the relevant insurances or you might want to follow up and find out what's going on if there's a denial you can re file the claim fixing the denial and then uh the the claim will disappear from this bucket and if you address the balance square please what about this rejected that's rejected that's a yeah that's that's weird i've never seen so many parklands this is parkland steps claim note information is missing or invalid that's strange uh and look at all of them say the same thing all of them yeah they they rejected for the same reason you're absolutely right let me quickly try to investigate this claim note information mister invalid if i can maybe offer you a solution right now i'd love to otherwise i will take in documentation for this we will research this on on these rejected ones and get back to you so this was sent out on uh june the third just two days ago and let's see uh what's going on here it's and and we can see that it's rejecting at the i think the clearing house level i will be able to comment in just a moment let me reach that specific claim okay so that's the first one on the top alright this element n t e 02 description is missing the elements standard option is mandatory and uh the n t e is defined the guideline position 1900 right so basically it's selling the n t e 02 description is missing so that's it's talking about the uh description note so that could be for the line level c p t and that could be for the complete claim let me find out uh looking at the electronic 8 37 file this is the data that goes out to the insurance are you familiar with this story no i'm learning okay you can say i'm sure you're familiar with the hicfa form 1500 claim form very good so it's it's an electronic version of that form when you when you send out your claims electronically so it has all that information to get your dedication so n t e let's see oh there we go so this is a n t e the one that i've highlighted in blue that says a d d that's maybe an incorrect message and i'm very sure this will be present on the charge page which once you see the charge page this is the charge page for the parkland alright that's strange with that's populating from maybe you've taken it out now but uh we certainly see going out we usually be it would be right here okay in the comments box that's that's what i uh that's what what my initial finding is but let me just conclude this bear with me because it's clearly telling us that it is something wrong with the n t e and then uh element and t02 description is missing element standard option is military okay and let me see the 837 file again basically that's as i explained the version electronic version of that hip profile that goes out so here is our claim yeah i do see it right there n t e which says add this one yeah yeah let me try that right now if uh i'll just uh so this is john here no worries alvarez thank you i will push one claim to the corrected side marcus corrected that will appear here so that i can see what's going on so who works at the who looks after the billing at your end you you're the biller uh so you should know how to uh i mean or you should learn if you do not know right now how to dissect rejection from within so we can see this is still going out uh if you don't mind or can you punch in a support ticket for this one i will investigate this how to get removed and then we will call you and give you the resolution so you can submit and fix all your uh 11 to 12 rejected claims for testing purposes i've pushed one now to the corrected side for here alvarez regular you can see all the 11 the rest of the 11 are still rejected bucket so just leave it there and correct marking look when you're here mark selecting a patient and marking it has corrected it does not mean that you fix the rejection we need to fix the rejection excellent so uh i just tried it so that i can generate a file and see what's going on now because on the uh charge page i don't see that ad message alright well let me let me investigate this further from where that that a d d is coming up in the n t e loop and that's not correct and then i'm i'm assuming that might be at the c p t level so let's go and see i wish i could learn all this you you certainly can i mean uh i work with the support here and uh on the billing side my team provides support andorra very soon you can i'm sorry how can i get classes to learn yes you can you can certainly that's what i'm coming to you can certainly request training sessions classes and also uh very slowly when whenever you have a problem punching a support ticket give us the details of the problem you'll make you'll make friends here at the support center and slowly you'll be as good as us yeah i mean it takes take time but uh i'm very sure you're a good learner why not why not do request uh you do request a training session on billing or or specific matters on billing such as rejections or denials claim submissions whatever you need help with and do mention on the ticket that you need a training session and uh yeah absolutely so my team will train you they'll help you and and and find out what's going on and slowly look at your progress as well and then because why i asked you that uh uh who's the biller at the practice and you said you is is very important that the biller should know since you are a support client you guys handle billing yourself and there's in house builder like you then you should know how to navigate the committee application how to work on rejections how to resubmit claims and payment post and all that right so do request that you can request a doctor cole maybe for if she can punch in a ticket requesting training for you on the billing side and and we can certainly offer you that why not so for now for now uh i don't have an offhand solution for this but this requires a bit of more research we'll see what the loop is going out and what's uh what's having this to to to populate the entire loop because there's nothing apparent here on the charge but there i'm very sure there's something will be so uh this is just my initial finding the final conclusion we will do after doing the further research under treatment patient uses referral alright new service requested okay so you just want me to put another ticket in i i would like you to put in a specific ticket in and and specifically mentioned that your your your rejected bucket shows uh 12 claims and there's for the same reason and for the same insurance plan that's what you gonna uh all our parkland p steps is the insurance 12 claims rejected for the same reason that's what i'd like you to put in and uh we will certainly my team will get back to you and let you know for now i've resolved and advise you about the functionality of the overdue bucket where the ticket that i was calling you for okay so uh we'll take it from there once you punch in the ticket for the rejected side i will do it right now excellent we'll be waiting and i'm very sure about monday morning or monday afternoon somebody should reach out to you by then alright do punch in one now for these rejected ones alright very well weekend ahead you have a good one thank you you're welcome bye"}}, {"id": 344, "data": {"call_id": "1620743969.816176.txt", "text": "mm thank you for calling curemd

hi evan how's it going all good all good simmons um do you have a minute or two uh yeah all right perfect so simmons first of all i do apologize for the late response actually i was uh back and forth in touch with the development team technical team and also the analysis team uh is that i can uh connect with your screen and i can show you what exactly is going on yeah uh hold on let me turn on my computer 1 second sure mm let me log in one second right uh anydesk right that's correct okay my i d is 230 mhm 713834 okay alright i can see your screen now let me see okay first of all i just wanted to um tell you one thing um uh simmons we discussed about the allergies and immunization that uh it was not um populating in the ccd file so i'll just open up that same patients account uh discussed it was 84826 sorry sorry sorry go ahead no worries for 246 sorry 84826 i believe this was the patient right okay so um what i did was i uh they tested it out on their end and they found certain things before uh if you remember simmons the immunization tab was incomplete uh it was blank so that's why uh you were not able to see the ccd file in there i just attached as a test to this particular um immunization in it uh secondly about allergies allergies actually um i'll tell you uh what's the logic behind our system so there is uh one week code and rx norm attached with a certain uh allergy right and if the allergies are uncoded uh you would not be able to see them in the ccd file only the coded coded allergies secondly uh if the rx norm is nil uh you would not be able to see that in the um ccd file because the ccd file it um from the back end it only uh populates the coded uh files uh uh the coded numbers they have in the rx norm so i'll give you an example um what i did was i so i added this immunization and then if we go to allergies we go to allergies we added certain allergies in there as well so the red ones are the unquoted one so you will not be able to see them and if the rx norm is nil for a certain allergy you would not be able to see them in the system as well so what i did was i added multiple allergies i added uh uh immunization as well so now if we go to the ccd file let me go to export and let's go to preview so let's go a bit down so you see allergies are there so we do uh our system do picks the allergies but the if the rx norm uh or the v code you can say is zero or nil it would not populate the allergies and also the immunization immunization was blank before i added one immunization so you would be able to so there is no logic and immunization whatever you add you should be able to see it in the c c d file but as far as the allergies are concerned if the v code and rx norm is nil or zero you would not be able to see them because our system from the back end only populates the coded uh rx norm in the um c c d file doesn't mean yeah so if you go back to the allergies can you just show me where like uh how to update their coded so and if you go back to allergies yeah so how do i update so like the pain it's uh how would i change that uh how how do you add the peanuts no no so when you said coded could you just elaborate that a little bit like the insulin what's the what's the difference between the insulin and like the peanuts moderate i'm trying to understand that uh actually uh that is something that the technical team can answer better but uh what they've told me because i only work with the front end of the application so they figured it out in the back end and sql that um if the rx norm because on the front and you you will not be able to see uh which one has a nil um you know rx norm that's the queen of the backend so so when you added it what do i need to look out for um let me see the peanut sorry i'm not able to see your screen properly oh yeah it's showing peanut uh yeah first you can click that yeah let's just click that and hit save so as you can see if it's red that means this particular uh allergy is uncoded so if you click on that is there a way to change that to um how do you i believe you can add it to the library and see if that can help right so this is also uncoded so uh on the back end the library we have that's uh from there um uh the coded can be populated i believe from the front end it would be only uncoded got it uh so how would i do if there's maybe you can tell me the instructions on how to make them so you're saying i only i can only use the system i'm still confused like how do i get the coded value so how do i change them i go here there's something different about this uh let me confirm that with the technical team as well simmons uh let me give you a call shortly okay okay thank you alright okay okay"}}, {"id": 349, "data": {"call_id":

i did this lets say i did it to myself assigned this to myself then when i saved it you see how i got this one over here this i need copy so if you yes if you sign this to yourself you will get this right here if you sign it to all everybody is going to get it here and if you pick one person they are gonna get here so i just wanted to show you that okay amazing so awesome so believe it or not mr arman we are almost done with this module we only have two more to go uh just uh last few things i just wanted to tell you so we did not messages we did task and now mr arman if you see right below where it says my preferences and you see quick links this is the only thing you have to keep in mind other things maybe not as applicable for you right now but quick links if you click it you see how it says today is patients on the top so you can actually as you want lets say you want to have tasks right here if you want to have documents or anything if you click on this i will not do it but if you do it will show up right here just like a shortcut for you so it is much easier for you to access certain things when you log in okay amazing okay so we went over messages task my preferences and one cool thing mr arman is lets say if you always use messages and or you always use task it has a very cool feature if you actually anything over here if you actually just drag and drop it you can create a little shortcut over here on the dashboard so just just showing send over here but usually you can uh just copy and drag and drop other things over here so it is kind of like a very cool shortcut for you so yeah so you see how we we have task over here and we have that i need coffee so it is very cool to kind of yeah uh check and keep tabs on things so mr herman i just went over the personal dashboard module i showed you how we use messages create task also set up quick links for easy access any questions on this at all mr arman anything at all uh no no pretty pretty pretty clear amazing that is awesome to hear and you can stop me just reminding you mr any time okay please do not hesitate i would love for you to stop me whenever you have a question okay now mr arman moving along so we did the personal now lets go on to the patient module this is mostly where your work will be involved since uh a doctor bhoot told me you will be uh dealing with patients lot and just letting you know mr arman this is very easy okay i just like to explain it in more of my way but uh hopefully it will be very well understood uh understandable towards you so all you have to watch out okay mr arman so lets say you have a patient come in okay and you have to you know put the patient into the curemd database it is as simple as just click on the patient module click at and you have the screen that is it and now all you have to watch out for is mr arman you see these little red star things right next to it these little aspects yeah so so those are mandatory so all you have to make sure these are filled out anything else is mandatory if you want to fill it out that is absolutely on your own request but if you fill out the asterisks and you save them uh you will be uh successfully been uh registered patient within the database so just for demonstration purposes mr arman i am going to do one right now so i am going to put test test you can make sure and see i am filling out all the asterisks that is a male just gonna fill out random credentials put in a date of birth not gonna go with an asterisk and one thing uh mr arman red asterisks are mandatory it will not let you continue blue asterisks these are not mandatory but these are related with billing so if you do not feel anything with the blue asterisk it might affect billing but besides that it will allow you to continue to the next page so got it yes so very straightforward uh mr arman first name last name filling out their address their zip code city you pretty much have a great idea about that uh mr arman so just filling out basic stuff you have the home phone numbers location all that kind of good stuff so lets say we have finished this now in case you are wondering what this emu is this is called meaningful use now what this really is it is nothing that will affect your patient intake but this is for example most meaningful use is gathering a lot of information for lets say future better decisions lets say if preferred language we have this coming in for lets say spanish and we have 1000 spanish people that we just registered so it creates a database just to tell me that meaningful use hey we have a 1000 spanish people so we have lets say it creates like a a chart to show you how much people of different you know like from which places which locations that just gives you a report it is not very as i mentioned applicable for your uh own workflow is just like you know for uh the overall uh you can say just information basis like there is a lot of the departments that take care of this but it is just there so you do not really have to worry about it i just wanted to go over that with you real quick so uh yeah so you pretty much fill out everything over here red asterisks referral source that is lets say if somebody came to the practice and they heard about uh the practice from somewhere you can either create one like lets say hey i came into your practice i have heard it on lets say uh facebook so you can create one just for documentation purposes or you can select one over here that is only if they come in for referral referring who is referring provider that maybe send them over you can get again uh choose one or you can add one then you have the primary care yet again that is only if that applies but it is very easy just clicking you can create one and then you can select one so that is pretty much take care of that in the comments at the end lets say if there is something that we really have to watch about this patient coming in lets say they need a wheelchair so that is something for uh whenever they come in you have these comments to let you know there is something we have to be careful about this patient so yeah so pretty much it so we fill out the demographics we fill out everything we fill out the referring if there is a comment we fill that out if we click the primary insurance option you can add their insurance over here if it applies so it is very easy you just click on the plus yet again life it makes our life so much easier with these curemds little add options so as soon as you click on plan add you can search the plan you can pretty much go by state by state you have all these features to help you find the insurance then you have the address it applies from over here fill out any other uh option and bars that applies mr arman and after that you are done and the cool thing about this is i will show you this in just a moment but this is how you pretty much do it after we save the insurance i will show you this in another step but after we save the insurance it will give us an option to upload a front and a back copy of this as well but that only gives us that option after we have had insurance but that does not really uh affect anything but it is pretty cool that we can have a image of the insurance itself so primary insurance uh as it is mr arman we have primary then we also give you an option to add a secondary insurance if that applies yet again the same work process for this too sir so after you have done filling in the demographics any referral any insurance we go up and just hit the save option and yeah i am location where did i miss that out okay right now i am just gonna go one yeah forgot that and see if you do not pick one and just and that is a pretty good thing it actually stops you before you save anything that might might be left yeah that really saves so you can see it is actually since yeah you see there is a lot of stations so uh yeah that is i am i am just gonna take care of this okay so i am gonna choose save as new yeah just gonna save this as new yeah because uh there is a lot of options over here okay and just one thing mr imran with no doubt nowhere and no doubt where you might be in your curemd one thing you have to watch out for it sir just kindly make sure whenever you make any changes or any changes you must hit the save option i just really need to emphasise on this because our system does not work in a way if you make any changes then you go back it does not automatically save those you have to yeah you have to hit safe to really save it or it is just gonna have you enter it all over again so just something that i would encourage for you to watch out for because it is happened a lot of times uh within our clients so yeah got it yeah so pretty straightforward any questions at all mr arman on adding demographics adding a referral or maybe adding uh insurance anything at all maybe no not at all i think amazing yeah so one more thing you can actually upload the picture scan it or take one through the webcam over here as well so just a extra thing for the profile now moving along so did you actually realize mr arman as soon as i made a patient i have all of these new options that just showed up right next year these were not there and do not worry about that these are very straightforward mr arman so lets take a dive good thing is this insurance tap it is pretty much the same thing we did over there so lets say we click on insurance we have this ad option there we go mr arman that is the same as we did right now so it gives us an option we can pick select an insurance actually now mr arman i am going to show you so just give me one second and i will demonstrate for you okay sign on file i think we might be good let me try to see if i can save this okay building rejection okay okay just one second perfect yeah so it just gave me an error because i did not save any uh zip code or any uh other just fill it out all the way through this one right here i remember when i told you mr imran that if you do not fill out the blue asterisks it gives you a billing error and if you actually look for it do you see that yeah it shows right overhere policy number right here so this is what happens when you do not save anything with the blue asterisk just giving you uh uh hey this is what you missed but what i really wanted to show you mr imran after you saved an insurance then it gives you this option remember i told you how you can upload the front and back of the insurance so it gives you that capability now moving on with the contact now anything else uh mr imran everything uh anything you might need to ask on this no i am good amazing now lets move on to contact so pretty self explanatory so lets see support is putting it like this the difference between the support and responsibility responsible party support is a personal relative for somebody hey if i am not available you can call my brother but responsible party is hey i could not i was not able to pay or i was not available to pay or maybe i was sick or maybe i was in the hospital you know like not conscious enough to make decisions to make payments responsible party is the person that is next in charge to make any payments or anything that might be responsible to lets say a payment now this could also be applicable in lets say if you have a patient that is under age right if you have somebody that is underneath the age of 18 lets say they come in you enter their page and they are not able to pay that amount by themselves or if they do but just in case we put lets say uh responsible party for them like lets say his dad is going to pay everything for him so we have the responsible party contact right here so yet again if anything responsible with finances that is gonna come under responsible if it is just like hey we ca not reach out to this person who else is there we can contact so support is going to have their people who are directly related with them and these people are who are related with them but more in a financial kind of way uh does that make sense mr arman awesome so i am just gonna open this up i am just gonna try to save some time and just show you so yet again mr imran you can see the red asterisks make sure to fill them out country from address all that kind of good stuff clicking save and we will be done with adding a support yet again mr arman same thing for the responsibility responsible party you fill out everything and we are good to go yeah so pretty much same the employer and lawyer yeah if they have one of these uh yeah you can fill those out but they do not even have an asterisk but that is only if they ask or need to have it filled so yeah so we are done a contact uh i am gonna move over to consent okay awesome so let me click pause and i will go over awesome so uh as it says mr arman uh consents if there are any consents that have been verified by the client like the client gives consent to do certain things within the practice and this is just where you can go ahead and add those or you can make a consent or you can you know how you can pretty much like have these uploaded or created over here so lets say if i and you actually have a type as well you can pick out a consent form that is very widely used lets say we go with the hipaa consent description everything here we save this and if you go back to consent we will have that consent available right here and uh yet again the consent as you know it applies from patient to patient so maybe uh they might have a different consent needed that is how you can add it that is how you can check what consent has been added any questions so far mr imran no no not at all amazing so uh just a bit more than he will be almost done with this so disclosures uh so the best way to describe this is mr arman uh so if in a specific or certain situation any information for the patient is being sent out to somebody like lets say lets say you have a lab outside the practice that you guys send over your lab results right and there are certain information that you are sharing with the lab or maybe any third party so these disclosures are like hey before we send out lets say uh before mr imran sends out ryans information just giving an example uh you are gonna be you are gonna ask me hey ryan kinda send out your information and i will be like yeah so this is the disclosure which you can put in to be like hey before we are sharing this or we are sending this information out anywhere besides cure md i have talked with the patient i have had their disclosure and everything is good to go and as you can say it gives you a description it even gives you that option who is just being released to could be a third party could be a care provider released by purpose you know like just just documenting and making sure if anything does go out from curemd you can add a disclosure here so that we do give you an option for that alrighty amazing okay uh and yeah lets just we are almost done with this i am feeling amazing and uh awesome so preferences uh not a lot going on over here these things right here alert you can set alert reports something you might not really be using as much right now uh pharmacy right here that you can add a pharmacy if patient has a specific one so yet again the handy dandy plus icon we click that it gives us this option the pharmacies uh encoded in the orange color that those are the ones that do not have electronic prescription support it more of a pickup option for that but anything in the blue those do have the electronic prescription uh capability as mentioned so yeah just making sure if it is much easier for the patient to either have it electronically prescribe they are like hey we can pick it up ourselves can you look for maybe a liberty pharmacy that does not or maybe has a pick up you know so it is based on what is required so you can go through and pick it as you like so yeah so you can add a far pharmacy over here and yeah i think it is not gonna let me go right like this i am just gonna pick one okay so perfect and restrictions uh this is yeah pretty much as it says you can put restrictions so if you put user and we put anything here so this this user will not be allowed to see this patient and you can do this when creating or you can do this after as well so if i do yeah if i click in a user uh lets say pick up anybody uh from the practice i do not want lets say anybody to see it you pick that and whenever the services patient they will not be able to find it so it is simple as that uh just wanna give you a very quick review marmon of i personally want to so when it comes to demographics where we put the patients information insurance adding the patients information contact we have responsible contact person who might be in charge of payment support anybody who is available if the patient himself or herself is not consents they have agreed to certain consents able to provide information or go through certain procedures within the practice disclosures before sending out information we just want to make sure the patient is okay with that obviously so we ask and then we put a disclosure preferences that is where we add the pharmacy restrictions where we make sure that hey i do not want this patient to be seen by maybe someone in the practice so you can add the user there so within these tabs any questions at all mr arman anything at all no not at all pretty pretty pretty good uh thank you so much i am really happy it is um helping you with this so uh good news mr arman we are almost done we just have one more module to go and uh uh after that if you have any questions anything i will help you further but without further ado i will go ahead and i will switch over to the scheduler now the dashboard being the homepage patients where we adding the patients now after we added the patient what do we do after that we schedule an appointment and this is very pretty much all of that goes down it is very simple even though even when i started i looked at this i was like oh my god so many things so how do i wear like for for me personally was but i will just kinda show you how you can make the most out of this so what i will do this okay so i just pulled up mystery uh doctor booths profile and i am just gonna show you how this works now as soon as he opened the scheduler mr arman and you see this page pop up you actually might not even get anything showing up as for now this might take just a little bit more time because i want you to be the best at this uh just so i clear out any uh things that might come up when you start taking patients so i just wanna go over this a little early so as soon as we go into the scheduler you will probably see this now if you can see my cursor moving i would love to start from the left side mr arman now scheduler right here this this option where it says booths surgical this is the location now if you click this you will see a lot of locations that you might be familiar with most of them these are associated with uh doctor booths uh practice so you have all these locations now mm locate when you click on a specific location the box underneath that as you can see that is the provider that is associated with this location maybe if you go into any other location you might not find so the best way to check if there is a provider at this location when you click on the location itself it will show you right here now if there is not a provider that works within the practice and you might be mr arman you know you have outsource doctors you have third party um you know doctors working on different roles with different specialities if there are any same workload which pick the location besides being provider we click on resource and only if there is any other doctor at this location that might not be working within the practice it will show you underneath resource now how does that work or when this this even come into play where you can actually use this resource for example lets say if you have a new doctor that is working outside the practice and doctor booth tells you that hey i want you to book an appointment for lets say a new doctor doctor carl just give an example i want you to book an appointment for doctor carl for etc xyz time so for me to be like hey i know like uh doctor carl works in another location but he is like at the same location but he is not a doctor here at curemd so uh so when you click on the location resource are those other doctors any other doctor that is outside the practice working with your practice if that makes sense mhm okay so just explaining provider in resource now lets say you click on the location the one you will be working on with the most booth surgical and now you want to schedule an appointment for doctor booth so with the location in mind then you see doctor booth populate right here so you want to book an appointment for his calendar so we click on the doctors name and now you will actually see all of these uh days populated now anything that is in green that tells us this day is available completely for appointments anything that even has one on it the color changes from green to yellow just like this and if its all booked they will give you a red so that just kind of tells you like hey these days are almost booked so you can kind of make like further plans and being like hey like this day might be the best to schedule these patients because we have a lot of free appointment so that is just the way for you to tell like which day is booked which day is not and which day is overly booked so the color coding really helps with that yellow red and green now something i want to really get into before i jump into booking an appointment so right now as you can see mr arman we are on a daily view so if one page has any more sections as you saw in the patient module we had this 12345 sections so it also happens here as well so there is like a chain so currently we are on the daily view now what is a daily view just like this and you will understand this in just a second just like this how this is starting from 8am and keep in mind mr this 15 i get confused too but this 15 is not starting on the 15th the way you can look at it is going right here so this line is zero then 15th 8 30 so this is nine if that makes sense so it is starting that way so just to explain it so if you can see this going all the way down so this is our daily view but if you click on weekly we can actually have more than one calendar populating right here and if we just a moment okay perfect so and on the weekly view same here remember as we chose the location than the provider on the weekly view it gives us the same option so right here we have the location i am gonna pick up booth surgical i am gonna pick out the provider doctor booth and now you will see all those appointments for multiple days show up in a line so that is just the way you can kind of you know if you are working on other things looking at hey todays schedule tomorrow schedule the days after schedule you can have kind of like a fancy expanded view of looking at all those things at the same time now lets go into multiple so now multiple so daily weekly just making making sure that i am able to make you understand correctly so daily is for one location and one provider weekly is one location one provider multiple views now multiple is one view for each location so this is like one of the most extensive ways so lets say if you have three doctors and you want to check all three daily schedule so i can put in one two three and if there are three providers i can choose more than one and look at their todays calendar for every day without going back to daily than putting one then coming back then putting one so it is a much easier way to do this at this time at the same time just to make it easier for you yeah yeah that is what you mean yeah exactly so lets say lets say there is uh mister doctor booth and lets say there is another doctor and both doctors uh ask you hey can you help me and tell me today what patients are we seeing at 3pm or 2pm rather than you going to daily then picking the location doctor booth and then looking at hey what time three oh yes doctor i see you have sean or coming in and then you go back and you check the other doctors as well uh rather than you going manually back and forth back and forth yeah you can simply go into the multiple options and you are absolutely right as you ask this is yes exactly what we do so we can check the same location right now we only have doctor booth but yes if we had another uh provider we can select that so just like doctor booths scheduler shows just like another provider if they were there they will have their schedule showed so it will be as easy as just comparing the appointments like this like hey i see this right here right this hey doctor i see this one is at 3 and one at 3 so just an easier way to look at things and use people use multiple ones honestly arman it comes down to the need usually just because you know sometimes on some days you might have a few patients so it is much easier to just like go through the daily view you have this easy view to see like hey appointments but sometimes i guess when uh you are working on a lot of stuff or you have more than one provider uh as of now i see it is only doctor booth so i would suggest and i personally think you will mostly and only be using daily and weekly but multiple lets say if it gets a little too crazy or if you have in the future more providers coming in or more resource provider as i mentioned you know any doctor outside curemd so yeah so this will help you in the future if as i mentioned you have to do one thing for one doctor of one thing for one doctor and i will get to scheduling an appointment too so this will help you in the future on maybe scheduling multiple appointments for multiple providers or maybe even looking at multiple schedules for multiple providers so we just try to ready you up for how crazy and make it in the future yeah so this is this will just help you like that but do not need to worry uh mostly i believe you will be using daily and weekly so i will show you how to book an employment on that but uh any questions at all until now at all for this entire scheduler by any chance no no no not at the moment amazing okay so you can yet again uh i would love if you can stop me at any time if you have any questions i would love to answer any if you have and yes so perfect the chain no active chain found honestly we do not even use this that much not even i personally have not used this yet uh let me okay i would still love to ask what this is is it okay if i can just get one second i am just gonna ask her through thank you uh thank you so much for staying online so arman uh i was not actually able to find out what this chain is maybe we did not use this for so long we forgot but what i yeah what i will do for you is uh i will finish the training yet again this is maybe a very small thing you might not ever use but it is still very good to know this i will get this answer and i will call back in and i will let you know what this is but uh for now i am just gonna skip this one for now amazing so last thing uh we have statuses so status is just like your entire google chrome history kind of like that way on which patients where schedules which patients were confirmed which patients so you know all that kind of good stuff you have reasons their location the provider check the status so this just gives you the entire history of whatever you will do on the daily weekly are multiple uh tab so without further ado and i hope i have been able to explain this well enough now we will go ahead and book our first appointment so i went over this and this and uh yes so just right here i just wanna go over quickly over this uh yet again location provider this is their schedule and this shows you the entire month view and the next month after that if you click on the triangle absolutely gives us the next month and so after that good example this is all booked so we have this one in red for labor day so just showing you that little red option that shows up so what i will do is lets say i pull up a patient so what i am gonna do is i am gonna pick a previous date so lets say we have june and just for test purposes i am gonna pick one day lets say friday said yes sundays a safe day so awesome so this is what we are presented with now lets say we uh have to schedule an appointment for lets say 10 30 so this is as you can see this is where the 10 30 slot is starting from yeah i think that is wow okay so one second let me try to see if there is a i think that is gonna show this oh perfect yeah well this really helps me to so uh the best thing is you can double check that even though this is 15 but when you click on a slot it also tells you the time what time this is so that really helps as well but uh as uh i was about to say so scheduling an appointment mr arman is as simple as picking out the date this location provider what date and then when you get this it is as easy as clicking on what time you want to schedule it as let is say uh mr booth wants me to schedule 14 10 so i click on the double 0 10 just click on that and we are giving the screen now yet again very easy so you can either click add someone lets say they just came in and you know it is an emergency you have to just quickly schedule the appointment or somebody called and just wants to have the appointment schedule but you did not have time to register them as a patient so you can actually do that very quickly over here so you can hey i want to schedule an appointment okay you click that for when 10 okay and they are not a patient quick at fill that out boom they are new patient and as soon as you say that they will automatically just pop up here as the new patient now what i will do is i will search oh awesome so heartless by the way so heartless is like the most frequently used patients that you have like when you open up your browser and you get those automated suggested you know links like i am opening a youtube video like it gives me the most recent clip that i watch so this is like the most recent patients that came in and this is actually the test is that we made so that is really awesome so i am gonna click test test because we have recently created uses that is why i showed up now this is the page that it gives us yet again very simple status that is gonna remain schedule reason that asterisk you can uh pick out whatever applies for this if there is a new patient follow up anything else that applies to the patient no template now no template itself is uh usually done by the provider but it is something that you might not really use that much but it is more what you personally have to watch out for is just the reasoning for what reason you are setting them up for lets say i will do a follow up yet again insurance they say that what insurance they have to use if this their primary one or secondary one you can select the one that applies and okay for now we just have that one because that is the one that i added and after we have selected everything just gonna go ahead and schedule amazing so now you can see mr arman we have just scheduled our first patient and uh the reason which is the most important thing uh it shows up right here like what so it is much easier for you and the doctor to know hey what are they even coming in for hey it is a follow up visit so that really helps with things right there now right here i want to mention one thing because i think this will really help uh since this is blue okay now if we click on this summary option and then we get this now this is just some information mr arman of just for information purposes blue that scheduled as you can see right here and the good thing is when you are on any day at all any day at all and then you press the summary option it gives you an entire list of only that days summary that you can see there is nothing else scheduled only that one blue that i have just scheduled scheduled right here now lets try something now you can see that there is a check in in light purple or pink um i can not really say but if lets say when you schedule the patient uh all you have to do is to click on the patients name itself so once you have clicked on the patients name it gives you all these options now you have this check in option all these different options edit appointment reschedule for now what i will go with is just checking them in we schedule them the patient comes in hey and this is where you click and as soon as you have clicked i am sorry i am just gonna do this one more time perfect yeah so as soon as you click in uh on the check in option mr arman you can see that you get a new pop up now this is two out of two pop up that you will face the first one asking you for who you are scheduling it the second one is to confirm the check in so you can put in the time lets say they came in late so you can make those adjustments or came in early either way which applies insurance nothing too much to fill out right here and he has the one thing i actually realty had wanted to go over this i could not really see this so the copay right here this little option right here so if they do have a copay you can collect it at the check in and at the checkout itself so you can either do it here do it at the end and if they do have pay the copay you can put in the price and you can click paid and you can click paid copay or anything else if it does not apply to copay and then you can click and in just a moment it is going to did you do okay why is it going through just one second okay copay wow okay i am gonna decrease in okay yeah i think it is maybe on the day i cannot really i just need to get through this page okay oh i see what is going on okay why is not it letting me save it never happens this way i i swear it never does i have no idea oh it is first time for everything right yeah i know right it is even glitching up a little bit wow okay just let me try this one all the time already i am gonna click this okay check in okay awesome yeah we got the date right here we got the time dude i am gonna do 50 thursday okay i think this was what i kind of missed out okay i am just gonna put this okay lets try this oh finally ok uh what wait okay yeah it is giving me the zip code option patients okay yeah yeah okay got it patient cities required okay you see that like it was giving us that same address things like because i was just filling it out i did not put in any information for the insurance or if the person itself that is why it says patient zip code or patients yeah it is pretty much only that but once you have an actual patient that has all that information you will not yeah get this so lets say i have clicked this ooh which yeah she will go through come out okay yeah if you would not mind just give me one second let me fill this out because yeah i think it is not gonna let me go through without this i cannot blame the system to be honest okay i am gonna you would be surprised mr system is very smart okay new york new york lets put in a zip perfect save it already we done um-hum oh just stay with me just trying to figure this out real quick dude that is so nothing we can solve okay 30 march uh no okay just give me one second yeah thank you i am gonna go with this perfect now 30 minutes reason follow awesome awesome awesome looks great lets save it okay yeah give me okay that is fine uh yes give me this because i scheduled it all the way for six and it actually ends at six so i just told me i had just told me bro you need to check out wow oh my god the system though alright uh almost done i am just we just have the scheduling part left and then we are pretty much done with this uh i just cannot really i wanted to ask a quick question oh yeah yeah before before i forget later on anything like lets say i need like i do not understand i could just call you and then you could just explain to me most definitely and and i i would personally love and encourage that because i understand this is your first day at the end of the call what i will do for you is there arman uh rather than we usually have our overall number that you call it that you can get connected to somebody but i will tell you my personal extension at the end of the call so lets say throughout your day i am i am in the office for the next three hours so if you have any questions that i will run i would love it if you can call me and if anything is there i can help you out with got it thank you anytime and i hope you have an amazing day thank you appreciate it okay lets just try and schedule this so we can go and have an amazing day okay awesome this is now hopefully it does not give me that error because i have all the patient information here day patient comments okay copay dude i am gonna not gonna put a copay and just to see if this does go through okay yes just giving me a notification there it is it is nothing major it is just like i think i am yeah probably not doing this okay yeah let me just reconfirm why this is not going through okay i know why it is not going through man it is giving me that insurance thing but it keeps on going away i was playing with patient registration please updated i think i did did i okay lets just go with this saving it all right awesome something has to do with the copay or it is no i know i think it is more about the location because i am putting in those tiny tiny address things and all updating it right here but it keeps giving me that you know uh this notification other things when i made the patients now it is only giving me insured parties yeah okay lets fix this and see magic happen i guess so what so what i did not do actually is just because i was you know showing you when i added the insurance and how could i meant like this is just the most important thing but uh i just did it just because it was uh training purposes but i forgot to put in a zip code for the insurance yeah i did not put yeah i did not put a zip code that is why it is just not letting me do anything which i cannot blame them to be very honest awesome so what i am gonna do is i am gonna go back here add a new one oh i get it i get it i get it yeah alright i do okay got it got it got it got it got it got it policy number i am just gonna go with a random one man i do not have insurance right now well right now as in like i cannot remember mind but okay lets see if it takes that awesome scheduler then okay 31st amazing amazing amazing and perfect perfect perfect perfect oh you gotta be kidding me man uh uh no no high school yes so the insurance party uh thank you for being so patient just give me one second computer needs a break oh my god that was a great one then i i think definitely might need a break all right okay we got that dude what am i missing it says the zip code number alright alright alright mhm mhm mhm mhm yours go to okay alright okay test test that was lakeside insurance yeah okay okay got it got it got it got it got it got it alright i am just gonna remember yeah i do not okay for now i am just bro like the plan and resting okay lets just try to save this awesome you have a kind of a hair care right now scheduler i really appreciate your mind for you tagging along to just like yeah man uh just trying to figure this out myself too so i can well explain this to you as well so that is okay awesome awesome i think it worked uh the primary plan with secondary plan oh my god man really wait okay okay i swear like that zip code if i did it right there i would not we would not be facing this right here just to make you go sure that you should fill out all the patient information okay lets see so it could be pretty much like extremely sensible or something like that uh um yeah uh huh it could be like extremely sensitive just because of one little i think that is not cashing or yeah but yeah no now you you are right but in this case it is only sensitive to that tiny thing is because the zip code was not there for the insurance and yeah just because insured the way insurance does file for things is like related with the zip code it is just not like letting me go through and like re added so i am just trying to find if there is a way i can usually when you do this you want encountered this because you actually take be taken down all the pieces of information from the patients but just because i kind of like showed you as prior of a training session i just did it for the visual purposes of it yeah let me just try to mhm okay just one second how about this man lets just try to get something so we can have our okay i am gonna try this one just as an appointment for you and would you like to view details alright we got this awesome lets check it in i kind of cared that is good that is good that is good nothing nothing nothing nothing awesome please the correct zip code okay yeah see how we got the same error again uh let me try to see where i need to go to resolve this just so i can yeah so you do not end up like spending more time on this since it is a very small error uh let me just put you in a very quick hold on and let me try to see yeah where to go about this okay thank you hey uh arman yeah so just stay on the line with me because i have just figured this out and wow this makes me feel it makes me feel so happy because what actually happened is yeah just one second alright alright alright alright no ray dude insuring party zip code is missing an invalid please update the correct dude i i swear if this is why it is not taking it in i think you must be so right there arman if this is so accurate with the zip code let me dude i think i have to put in an actual address uh okay wow yeah exactly i think that is why it is not letting me go through because i have to have an actual address okay i am gonna use uh like i am just gonna use a random one real quick lets see yeah i am sorry for the delay arman it is just like uh very precise i guess uh that is okay we got them okay okay okay mhm oh my god bro bro that was it uh i am sorry about the wait arman i hope that was that was a lesson for me too but that i think answers your question yes the application is very precise so it actually takes like uh a real zip code with the real address attached to it i think it is pretty good is not it actually but it does not have you like even patients like causes safety for like invalid information but without further ado yeah that was what it was happening now it really helps me to i should definitely use actual i will pick an actual address for the future for training purposes but yeah so just letting you know this one happened to you because you will be assisting real patients so everything will be accurate so awesome so but what i wanted to show you arman is that after when we scheduled it we had this in blue and after we checked it in the patient that turns over to this color right here now the great thing about this too is when we opened the summary it shows us the same change as well so now it shows that we have one checked in which was two scheduled now we have one schedule and one check in now lets say uh the patient went in the doctor saw the patient and the patient is about to leave then when we click on the name again we have the checkout options so pretty much in scheduler everything happens with the power of the left click so you press left click to check in to check out i think it is pretty cool pretty simple so we click check out yet again we have this option now uh as i mentioned for uh we have two options so we can either collect the copay when they come in or we can collect the copay when they leave the practice so you will get this option here too uh depending on how they want to pay it so lets say we did this everything looks good perfect and we click save and awesome and now if you open something you will see that this from scheduled to check in is now checked out so just yeah just gives you a summary now any questions on picking out a time setting an appointment checking it in and checking it out arman anything at all any questions that might come to your mind no not at the moment not pretty straightforward right like you pick the location the provider the days check the appointments create them and yet again if you have any questions you can yeah you can definitely call me i will be right here to help you but yet again if you have any questions you can ask them any time now uh we created our first employment we check them in we check them out we saw how we can collect copays while checking in or checking out as well now just a few things that are left in uh we will be done with the training so uh the thing i really want to get into now is lets say the thing i did not talk about and you might be wondering maybe too these options right here so these are pretty much what are left now lets talk about search pretty territory summary block block is lets say as it says the name block lets say the doctor does not want to see certain patients from lets say one pm to two pm or the doctor says hey i am having so someone come over for like an hour have a meeting so can you make sure nobody sees me between 12 to 1 or could be anything so blocks are block it out right pretty much block it out like nobody even you or anybody else within curemd will not be able to book anything so it will not be only for you it will be for everybody that is seeing the scheduler yeah and how do we do that the power of the left click arman click on block yeah click on calendar and yeah so it is give us this cool looking option now lets see did it did it did it did you okay i think i do 1 second okay it is giving me an option to just a second arman just one moment arman i will be right back sure thank you thank you uh thank you arman for staying on the line with me so yeah just wanted to confirm now uh when it comes to creating blocks as we mentioned yes if we do not want anybody disturbing in uh little words during that time period so when we click on blocks and then click on calendar so uh as we made the appointments like we did it by like you know like sections like hey 10 31 appointment or 11 that so blocks are created in a different way now how do we do that all you have to remember your mind is the blocks option calendar options these things right now we do not need to worry about those we click on add yeah just like in adding everything at the magical green option that i love and now this is gonna ask you lets say the name of the block lets say uh meeting yet again as in over here at the location we have the same dropbox so basically the block options asking you like hey where do you want to this block to be on which location so we are gonna set the booth location the dates now lets say arman um now lets say if this block is only happening for today yes absolutely you would go with the 30 30 but lets say lets say doctor booth says hey arman uh for the next week i have three days i will be seeing somebody for a meeting from 12 to 1 can you please block one hour from 12 to 1 from monday wednesday and friday right so rather than you creating those blocks one by one which would be you know just boring there is actually an easy way that we do this so when we are given this option lets say we are gonna keep this open for a week so i am just gonna go here that is a week okay we have a week when do you want it that is gonna be that time 12 and one okay now this is where that hey can you do this on monday wednesday and thursday those days that kind of thing helps us and it comes into place so when we click on daily so as it says every day from the 30th to the sixth it is gonna block this time every single day no exceptions if we click on weekly it gives us this cool little option now this is where you can actually pick out those mondays tuesdays sorry wednesdays and fridays so it is just gonna show these days not on the others monthly that is like just like very like long if you have something showing up for the entire month that is where you go but usually it is like daily or weekly now i would love to show you so i will i will go on 30th 30th lets say we booked an appointment for okay so at 10 30 so what i will do is just for safekeeping i will go 11 and yeah lets go with one okay so i am gonna hit this and then just a second we will see some blocks appear right here and there we go  arman awesome yeah so that is how you create blogs and no appointments can be set over here and yeah pretty much it and so awesome so we have talked about pretty much everything uh just two things left todays calendar this is a very cool feature that curemd has so rather than going through a long process on lets say the doctor says hey man uh i am seeing patients until six today can you extend it to seven i am working another hour so rather than you calling us or you you just figuring it out or just going through a long process curemd gives you this option which is update todays calendar so it is simple as which day you are on that day this option will update that days timing so we are on the 30th i click on todays calendar update very simple as you can see you can just change the start in the end timing how long you have owned the appointments to be and the reason working late i save this and in just a moment and then you will see we have this running all the way down to just one momnet online okay just one second i think it went to yeah okay seven perfect now it goes all the way down to seventh so easily on changing todays timings or anything if there are certain days you want to end the day earlier or later we give you an easy option to do so and yet again yeah if you want to lets say print this out or you want to print a report or the schedule report lets say uh the doctor wants to see the entire patients that are scheduled for the month and he wants a schedule report or report for it uh you can easily just uh click on these to get that certain report to so that arman to be very honest is all that it is with the training so today we learned how and what the dashboard is how to send messages how to create task quick links just one last thing so we are done with the training i am just gonna give you a very quick recap just a minute so our dashboard we create messages create tasks inbox and all that kind of good stuff we can drag and drop things onto our dashboard for shortcuts quick links are the things that we can assign ourselves to have them populate over here then we go into the patient we click on add we make sure everything in red is filled out we make sure the zip code is filled out so we do not face the thing that i was facing for five minutes on this singing doubt yeah we fill out the zip code anything else that applies awesome we are good to go then once we click save we have that insurance tab contact tab support tab all those options that i went over with and then when we click on scheduler this is where we book our appointments so we have the location we want to put the appointment at the provider we want to book the appointment for in the day we want to book the appointment click on it make an appointment quick at patient and then afterwards we left click to check them in collect the copay then check out left click click the copay then if applicable todays update to this calendar we can update the calendar right here summary gives us all the appointments with these cool color coatings right here to tell you what whats one is which and block we create blogs for days we do not want to see any patients within that time period now that is pretty much it anything at all and kindly let me know if i missed out anything or is there anything i could have explained better i would love to do so or uh if there is anything else i can help you out with no i think we are good ryan i appreciate it my pleasure arman now yet again uh i hope you have one of an amazing days today since it is your first day yet again i

the advance i'm sorry when you add the advanced uh was it yesterday or today no these are uh things i've done last month and for some reason i'm just finding out like i never realized it wasn't until i noticed that one of my patient payments that i had put in for like let's say april 23rd it was now under april 20th and i'm over here like oh my god now i have double the payments and i have to go through all my deposits and make sure that i'm not submitting double the payments i completely agree with you so did you uh check it today is it good now yeah so i just saw it today i ran the date of a bank deposit date of april 20 and it looks like all my patient payments are under this date so it's wrong or right it's wrong i i don't i don't even have a deposit for april 20 so these dates are all give me one quick these are dates that should be under different dates all different dates i completely agree with you let's see this can we uh can we share screen do you have any desk yes give me 1 second and now i'm submitting the pay i put the patient payments i wasn't aware of this issue and so now i have now i marked that patients paid twice instead of once i agree with you that so the number is 421 yes 999875 gotcha sending a request please accept okay i can see your screen alright so like all these credit cards should be under a different date can you confirm the correct date um for the credit cards they would be under april 24 april 24 and they're coming under april 20 right mhm okay give me one moment and then for the cash they're all different dates so now i have to manually go searching for them i understand that for example if i go to let's see if you start with the cash one so do you ever will that one should have been under date uh let's see it was april fifth however it was moved to april twentieth so now i manually put it again under april fifth and now again like now it's double the payment that's right because uh we need to actually delete the duplicate one so it can uh it won't be putting in your bank deposit both so let me actually uh makes you take you there lemme work on your screen so you would know what i'm working give me let me take a screenshot of this page okay now we can go to the patient module and for its one is 5059 sorry it's 5066 for which we have two payments we find that out okay that's the patient now under applied section is actually showing you $260 and patients balances 60 because like i said manually applied like two minutes ago the the payment again for april fifth because i thought for some reason somebody had deleted it or something not knowing because you guys never let us know that there was an issue going on actually the thing is it wasn't um before that in the initial there's only one practice who actually reported this issue and we were actually working on that to actually deploy the fix for all of the practices so um we were actually uh trying to work on the whole uh practices so like before you actually go ahead and put it on ticket regarding this issue it will fix automatically so this is how i um are well continue was actually working at the back end so i completely understand that and uh completely read like how it fits like because the information is being uh incorrectly yet in the system now so um moving forward i i have like 4 23 string as we paid $65 and um if you look at the get full 20's there right now so there's only two over here doesn't even they're they're they're under advance okay alright 65 65 and one is 54 for the yesterday one and 4 20 so you said you like this one shouldn't be under april 20th right correct let's see your status so there was 365 payments over here and uh last one was actually on march 30th 65 but it actually shows the right thing 4 2021 copay payment copay advanced 65 what it shouldn't be april 20th but it is actually showing you roubles troubles in this one because um according to the research what we research for the different practices we were having the right dates over here in the lock section but when we go to the patient advances it's showing a different date so mm you know because i i can i can tell you right now i i did not put april 20 because i don't have a deposit for april 20 so you don't have any deposit for april 20 yet right no okay no let's take this one as well charges advances zero and then advances again on 420 i might have put submitted it on april 20th but i submitted it with a date of april i'm sorry april five april 5th now if you look at the this 65 1 and um advanced was actually it was 65 by uh in by you actually and uh it's on may four is that the right one so we have an issue with these twos right the um may four was monday for this one again i submitted on may 4th yes but i put a date of it's a it's a different date i would i wouldn't be able to tell you off the top of my head no in these cases what we can do is because this is what we are getting in the logs as well we can go to the individual charge and i can help help you out on uh changing their dates so that's the best thing we can do right now now we need to actually check in the uh status section one more time so we can see under which inform from uh under which data service we have received 65 as an advance so we can change the um date over there and correct it will appear in your reports as well so 65 i think the easiest thing for it to do honestly because i don't trust it or i feel like i have already submitted the payments again because i wasn't aware of this issue is if the credit card ones the date can be changed to um april 24 and then the cash ones i'll be deleted and i'll submit them again again myself if they are missing or if they uh are you talking about the uh credit card payments that you posted okay so yes the credit card payments the date needs to be changed for sure to april 24th because all credit cards are put under the same date give me one moment however the cash ones i would like them to be deleted okay because those i have already either submitted them again or i will submit them again going i will look through my deposits and uh and check them myself because like i said i already submitted the like the v l a already submitted it again now um in these cases like if you want to delete the advances right now in the cash section which is appealing like full right now for 4 20 so yes you can delete them you can over um just go to the patient advances and you can actually um it makes you show you if it's the patient for which we are trying to delete the collected advance for 4 20 so you can simply go over here for patient advance and you can click on void and you can put a definite reason over here and then you can click on void so that's completely up to you this will be voided anyways and you will be able to add a new advanced with the correct date that's the first thing now in case if you just want to if you don't want to delete them but you just want to add a new date so you can simply check the status over here from this section and um in the uh for example this is the one that we are actually looking for thats april 6th so we will go to the charge will find the april 6th appointment which is right over here filed and we will go to the charge page it will show you 65 over here as in advance but it is actually a great out right now because 65 is actually posted against this payment so if you go to the payment section it's a longer road but um i think it's the right to do actually 46 is the one over here is it a um did you accepted this cash as a cash or a card it was a cash i'm having that issue all the time too it's always great out immediately immediately after pushing putting in advance for a payment and saving it it grays out every single time and that's an issue i've been having lately because if i for some reason put the wrong date i have to go to avoid take it off and then redo it because it doesn't let me edit it immediately we are working on that so whenever you are at the check in and checkout page you will have the uh two options of um voiding and refunding at the same time so you can use them because this is the this is how it works and in this way like we have actually given another option to actually collect the advances independently before that in the past you have to actually go to a different appointments so you can actually attach an advance with it and you can utilize afterwards but uh completely agree with you it's a hassle right now because you need to go all the way around to the patient advances and the patient profile so you can actually use avoiding refund options now the better thing is to actually uh do that because $65 right over here is actually being used and then there's a transfer as well yeah but that's not $65 being used by the patient this is the insurance payment i believe this is the one that we're referring to 4 27 1 $65 so um we can actually delete them out so this will actually allow us okay so the best part is actually uh you can simply void them these $65 uh payments so you can go ahead and add them again once you have the right okay this was the one as well which was actually posted we can see in which date of service it was posted and there you go 330 2021 is the data service for which the $65 of this payment is actually posted give me one moment that's the payment can we delete this this is um i'll figure it out right now but when when will this issue be fixed so that i know that going forward my pay my dates are not gonna change because this is creating credit hassle for something that we weren't even aware of like they should have let us you guys should have let us know that there is an issue going on because now i submitted double the payments thinking that i was the one that was in the wrong i completely agree with you andrea and i apologize for being late on this and the convenience you have to actually face so in order to verify this because we are already confirmed the relevant team that the issue has been fixed already but um i will double check with them and in case if you face this problem again do let me know okay thank you no problem thank you andrea you have a great day take care bye bye you too"}}, {"id": 365, "data": {"call_id": "1622822110.1303134.txt", "text": "dermatology associates how can i

because i know she did it yesterday that's why things okay yeah okay the number is 41 1905762 thank you i'm sending you the request you got the request okay accept alright perfect so uh hi everybody i uh just wanted to demonstrate the workflows of prior authorization but before that uh i would like to hi how are you doing today okay so uh do you guys have any questions any uh any you know any idea about how would it work and anything no here's what ben um so we want the workflow issue where i have a few questions for one ahead log in run so we have the the issue has been the prior authorizations and documentation of authorizations and we found out that we've been putting them in the wrong place the pre op requirements so we want you to help us out in um in putting them in the computer on the oncology care model this um the chemo model and i have a few questions does it automatically populate and say hey the p s status is not approved you need to go back in there and do it for for example if we've sharing anydesk with you and we have thomas lamont pulled up and do we have this prior authorized status where is this authorization status let's print that out and i want you to help us learn how to load those things so so do i make sense to you then i totally understand what you're talking about but instead we do it for a real patient why don't we pick up a test patient and i demonstrated for that's good but we wanna we wanna be able to practice on a real patient too so i want to go ahead and show us on the test patients hang on just a second let's print that out with the approval okay that's good let's go to a test patient then we'll let you drive alright i'm gonna take control of the computer i'm gonna take you here okay so starting from the very beginning when uh you know let's say you know already that this is the list of drugs that you're most of the times using for the patients for which you need the prior authorization so instead of uh you know uh recalling it which drug is documented for what patient and if prior authorization is required or not what you could simply do is you could go to drug management and pick up you know whichever drug you want to and you see where it says prior authorization required you can always check this box okay so drugs and so in the oncology care model go to the drugs and drop down to the management tab okay and choose drugs from here from the list you can search it from here once you search it you you check this box so that it was already tell you when you're documenting this medication for the patient that they're the prior authorization but this drug is required so that you already know that this is this is how it's gonna be so i'm gonna documenting anything right now i'm i'm just gonna get out of this one so uh let's say uh we're gonna create a plan for this patient there is already one created so let's use the same plan here uh you have created a plan here and uh you have documented everything the diagnosis and uh the schedule and everything now when you go to a prior authorization tab this looks like and then you're gonna add a new prior authorization for this patient i'm gonna click on new and it's gonna bring up the latest patient plan which was documented there and all the details there and and and now we're gonna documented here so now over here this portion it shows the documentation of new prior authorization this document of section over here you can add documents for this patient if there were any documents added to the document manager for this patient they will all appear here you just okay so we should have it there in the document manager is there a place that we can add them in the document manager so show me where that place is uh that will be there in the side uh so let's go ahead show me a place where we need to put that document in the way it is for this patient let's go in there and it's it's so is there a special site for that yes no the same way you put it in the documents for the patient let's say photos here and as i source here and uh you know all the documents referrals over here you know radiology results the way they are documented for this particular patient similarly you can documented for any patient and uh you know that will populate here i just do you have a let's from let's pull from mr tom thomas lamont stuff from the clinical stuff side and pull that up and see if we can use it on that patient the test patient that you have um showed sure uh would you by any chance have any documents you can upload into any any documents do you have anything any picture or something on your computer any picture on the computer that we wanted okay pull something is there any in the microsoft word on the computer what documents is there anything on the desktop anything you know you can take a screenshot of something pull up the desktop mm okay thank you okay so is there anything up in here do we have any documents up here there should be stuff on desktop downloaded going ahead and check and see what we can hang it where do i find the downloads but let me let me take you there let's see purchase order cost let's pull that one up i'm gonna put it up over here in uh other results maybe alright so i'm gonna upload it on them so you're gonna have to teach me how to do this thing oh really okay alright i can do that that's not a problem at all uh let me add an insurance card we don't have an insurance anyway so this is just to demonstrate so i'm gonna type okay find the date is stay i'll i'll demonstrate you what what this is i'm assuming that it will bring up this document here let's see it does okay so this is this is the document which you uploaded into any folder over there and it pulls it up here i'm gonna just check this box and i'm i'm gonna get done and it's gonna get uploaded over here you can add multiple uh documents added over here the second this time over here is about the procedures what procedures are taking the prior authorization for you can check the boxes here you can also mention that units let's say there are two units for this uh uh the procedure code you can do that you can put in some comments if there are any additional maybe you want to specify while you're adding to uh you know units if you know that's where the compensation appears here you can go on add it if you want to search that particular one you can search it from there as well let's say maybe so it's gonna be over here like this you can take the box here and that's it so you can talk about here so the pa number up here that one so how does that work well that will be uh provided you the insurance for this patient so this module uh majorly is actually for the documentation of prior authorizations this right so this will let you know within the system that how if the document if the prior authorization for this one is required or not however this will not have any role to play it's not integrated with any uh any insurance company or so so that it will automatically alright then this this section over here just give me a minute give me a minute make sure you can print out the problem this is united healthcare so the united person so make sure we have those because i want to practice i want to see how much how long it takes us to do these things sorry i was talking to okay so i'm sorry i'm working from home so i had to close the door okay alright we understand thank you so and we don't mind thank you doctor so over here this section over here that's where you document the uh the status of of the drug now also uh when we're documenting here i forgot to mention the first thing which is over here you see this is the date where your document let's say if you wanna you know backdate it you can back date it but you will not be able to backdate it before the plan was created so you can only back alright and also then you can document the type now this is the request that you're putting in for the prior authorization or is this a response that you have received for prior authorization you can document either one of them over here and uh let's say we are putting in a request for now and uh we have selected the document which is evident document that uh you know this this this drugs we are using these drugs because of this then this is procedures this is the two let's say drugs which are uh to be taken the prior authorization for that's where your document the duration for what duration is gonna be this is if the prior authorization status is required for some it might not be required so either you can leave drugs which are not required you can either leave them empty or mark them not required and uh for the drugs which are uh you know required you can mark them required now when we are documenting the request we will document of course required or not required whereas once we are documenting the response we will document uh it has approved or rejected accordingly and this one trip inside field entry we'll just go ahead and put them together that's what we need yeah go on ahead alright so the cycle and total treatment is coming up from the plan let's say you know at times let's say there are uh you know 10 cycles or something so you might not be requesting for all the cycles altogether maybe you're requesting for three or four cycles one time and then so on so for so you can adjust adjust this one as well uh how many are you trying to uh request for let's say before or something that you can uh you know change it from here go on ahead all right then uh if it is approved and uh you know how much is utilized to date you can mention here what date uh you know you're you're gonna start it from and to what date are you gonna use it this particular one i mean this is quite self explanatory i'm not gonna take a lot of time here you can also documented a code that you're gonna be billing so is the nbc you can pick up the end between you're using and total unit if it's a non available if this is a white bag or brown bag and if if there are any particular notes here your document this stuff for all the drugs here and uh that you do it then in the second the third part you have provider note administration and labs now this is the supporting things which you might require for putting up a prior authorization request so uh let's say you're uh requesting for this one and there was a pretty creative provide a note you want to add to this one here so what you're gonna do again click on add if there is any procedure progress note of documented with this station which is there you can just documented here it's done and it's gonna get a test awesome over here and similarly if there are any administrations let's say this patient had previously been on a plan and uh you already have some documentation there and you wanna add it up as a supporting evidence for this prior authorization so you can do from here and so is labs over here you can add the labs from here whichever you want to park for now and if there are any provider notes uh you can document here so i got you so can you can we run some tests stuff so there's one patient whose plan has not been started but we have requested for prior authorization for chemotherapy so i want to learn how to do that would you be able to help me do it of course of course one last thing only uh that once you're you're done documenting here you're gonna are you sure you wanna sign you're good now this is the request that you have put in so you're gonna print it out and you're gonna you know either fax it or email it however you want to deal with you see now all the details here whoever whatnot what insurance are you putting it up to and this comes up with all the documents this is the provider note this is the document is your attached and so on so forth so you're just gonna you know either fax it or email it accordingly okay alright pull up the patient you're looking for okay let's pull up mr stouk s t o u t stouk is the name so i think you did if you pull those little on how to do that that's fine so i have these documents that prior authorization requested and all of this stuff so i'll have catherine scan this see if she will scan this for me please so and i have the npc and um so let's go in there i didn't put a plan in on him so i can put it in now do you do you mind if i put it in now please go ahead yeah let's go on ahead and do it so order in our date is this what we'll start chemo later on so let's go ahead and play with this so we can get our stuff done i think this is how i learned solution is going to be me no no no no no let me change the that needs to be changed let me log rodney out of there and then change the order can we do that then yeah it's gonna be me okay okay let's go in here so the team of regimen that i'm thinking about is so let's look good day one and the 8th every 21 days for four cycles so you you see what i'm doing right so i'm start yes we're gonna go there honey i'm just trying to add to the order that's being requested we don't have the p a yet so we're gonna practice on all those things too you're put in the orders and then the schedules are created by your nurses or medical assistance basically it's the same i put the orders in and the schedules are going to be day one and day eight i usually do that and they come in whether the 21 day cycle how how did you can request it then we can stay back we're learning how to do this on the computer so okay because these drives request then we'll scan another one later on so i need that in the computer on the benadryl i'm sorry buddy i'm i'm wanting to learn this so we can make it easy for the crew to do what we need to do so we're gonna give i do it it doesn't take me long to put these orders in so i do that i have something to show you which is quite easier for you you will have to do what you're typing it every time okay let's do the next patient how about that sure um this way that's it i'm going to be crazy to any milligram i'm gonna show you that you're gonna like it actually i might yes absolutely let me fill basically what i do is i do everything like that don't take me long and the the chemo regiments that i see over there they drive me crazy so um 480 yeah this is the entity and regiments and stuff because most of the times we modify them in the floor um normal it should be carbo taxol so where is that i think i gave it to you uh huh so what happened uh so so why don't we just put those are we learn how to generate it how about that we learn how to generate it here i need to there's one other thing that i need to add is the 70.9 up in here as you're looking at me in india so what's going on is basically we're missing the prior authorization schedule and it's been driving us crazy so this is the new schedule that i think we'll give okay i'm gonna go back and then i'm gonna find this thing okay well uh just just to let you know uh since now you see what i hear all these drugs are saying they're unscheduled i understand that you have written the the you know the schedule here but they're all coming up on their unscheduled because there is no schedule created so the the workflow which i wanted to show you is by clicking on schedule and adding the new schedule the the one that you created over here which is for day one and eight yes you you name it what do you want to get to the therapy alright and now putting the cycles here for cycles cycles the reservation days how many days 21 days let's just put a political start date to be wednesday okay all right okay okay now i'm just gonna demonstrate you what i'm talking about you see you're over here what you only have to do is you're attached into this therapy and when you're gonna click on here now you i'm gonna exit out of this form and then it never did i played with it it never would work that's why basically type it in alright well i'll i'll check why is it not getting attached to this one here though it should be but because you know we are i'll check what's going on so so now you're saying i want you to troubleshoot this too so all the diagnosis that i had put before the 70.9 which is required by me because in order to be paid for the dark shark or anemia chemotherapy and all those things go away anytime touch this so let's say if and i do something else up in this window these go away they don't stay and that's been one of the pain in the end for me to deal with when i'm putting orders in goes away yeah they go away the two ones the two ones that i put in the go away so there's uh there's a glitch in the system and this has been going on ever since restored it okay go ahead and sign it now let's see if this stays there it'll stay there as long as i don't touch anything so let's see okay we signed it we got it now let's go to p a we have requested prior authorizations right once i sign it won't go away but what i found out is i have to do the chemo regimen this part first then put in these things because if i put these two in and then put the drugs these two do not it does not the system does not take it and i'd have to go back and put them so let's see what's going on here let's go to the system so we create on this patient and basically what we have done is how do we do new we have requested it so the request part is in there and now let's go to the clinical aspect of it this is mr stout okay stout  greg and it should be in the documents let's see the documents should have um the billing she said billing information this is the one that i want to upload into this part will bring all the documents here and uh billing information on 5 8 no not that one that's done on 5 18 she lets you know that may not be it pull that up let's see this is not that's not it she just candid into the system under billing she said just done today so it's done on 6 4 today so let's go back and take a look well that's the one we have right there here however she under she okay here here and here this is the one we want that's the one we want here and then it's not pulling up here though probably because it has just been added there you go let's add it perfect so just check the box uh huh i want you to do it so that i don't know good good i got you at this box and then out of here we have requested we're done no you you click on add okay i'll go back and do it check and hit down here yes so it's requested so we have the j codes for this if we want to add my note let's go to my note and add my note about that 62 progress notes let's add alright so it has approvals for pet scans in here do we have radiology or is it just um office established lobotomy supplies do we have radiology stuff in here to do you know the code 78815 okay hang on the wrong one my fingers are too fast from my brain now it's triple a okay so there you go with requested for oh my god we can generate this on the computer are you freaking kidding me so you have it here and now if you want to document uh the particular uh for this particular uh one the number of units or you wanna add any comments so i sign it and we print it uh well uh one last thing you have to document the drugs there what drug is you know if you want to document the duration i'm not sure uh document the duration time i don't think we need to alright and do you think you want to document the cycles cycles you will need it for total treatment six cycles let's say let's let's say we asked for six see it's not letting me do anything just not letting you add a number uh it's not just a minute i can go ahead of time and we can just print it up and then just nobody needs to write anything the j codes are already there oh i get it now actually because you know we we did not uh created uh uh create a schedule for that this one appears automatically over here uh but you know i'm gonna take a look into that then why are you not associate able to associate the schedule with the drugs and after you'll be able to do that you'll be able to you know these will come automatically over here and you'll be able to change it accordingly so you can let you know we can uh leave it be and all of them are required yeah all of them they are pending so that's why we requested it so the p a is pending so p s required it's not there and then we'll work on a patient who's ph is has been approved that way it'll give me information um on how we can troubleshoot this and another thing is i have a chemotherapy regimen like uh uh what is it ncc and regimen printed out could i where would i add it in the supporting documents uh you you have a document already printed out so you did you uploaded to any folder uploaded in the computer anytime we send for prior authorization the ncc and regimen is printed out and it's uploaded into the patient's chart so and and the clinical side let's go in the clinical sign and it will be in the chemo regimen and it should be here let's take a look there it is so where do we add this one clearly where you added the documents out of here okay you're gonna add the documents so the full name is chemo regimen so it should be 21 let's open that yeah that's the one alright alright and uh okay and now if there are any you want to add documents j codes you wanna document the nbc the total units and all that you can do that uh and you're gonna hit sign here once you're done and go ahead and sign it requested rodney how did you so we ask for for what is 50 number of units is 50 oh let's let's go up and what we requested and how we calculated this number of units were never been a 50 for at is what 80 his that's the dose mhm i don't know so that's the part that we need to find out what we requested for so the dose was 50 or 60 mg this is not number of units i don't think this is the correct amount yes this is uh this is not the dose this is the number of units which will be built so we might request for 20 of this 12 of this and let's put in just for the heck of it let's put in um 20 of these or whatever numbers we have so that is something that we do need to pick up and say hey if 10 mg make one unit i might use 100 mg of it so it's gonna be 10 units well you if you pick up the sea so let's say this is gonna be let's say it's going to be documented under j1200 and you're going to be uh using this uh nbc so it's gonna it's gonna calculate it should calculate some of the ones are in red the red means that discontinued but i'm just saying that why is it not calculating is because the cycle and treatment days are not documented which is why it's not calculating it for now so you can for now uh leave it be and uh document the units here but i'm i'm gonna take a look in the back end and see why is it documented cycles in yeah so we'd like another class on monday after three o'clock if possible if you're free to help monday oh shit i'm not gonna be happy tuesday tuesday tuesday please monday after three all right i can i have a slot available after 3 we can do that okay let's not waste much of your time so i'm gonna find this thing and i'm going to print it do you have five more minutes or 10 so let's sign let's sign it i'm gonna sign it and let's see how just print it okay let's see what it looks like how do i print it oh okay i have to print it here and this is the printer button north printer how many pages are there continue bye now i'm gonna log rob me out i want you to help me to load the patient that uh hang on so this is a supporting documentation that we can send for how awesome is that well it would be much more easy the system will let you document the cycles in treatment day than you know the system will calculate the total units automatically uh it's just that i'm gonna take a look at that why is it not letting you do that right now absolutely i did not log you out no but let me let me go to curemd and let me just got i forgot about this i don't know no i log out i wanna be able to do it myself you go on ahead ronnie i'm gonna take care of this one i'm gonna learn how to do it so you work on medicines pa and um so let's pull up lamont i want his prior authorization approval stuff if you will give those to me all the i want the rest of the other on jones that were jones do we have the pa i know i need to know and we need to make sure he gets we get paid you know or let's do patty jinnah well i need those approvals so we need to learn how to put those things in here so we so let's look at this one this is a lady that's getting chopped alright where is it open up so we started on 4 27 so we can do the prior authorization on that day let me go in should i do new or should i just say new new let's go to now you see this it's appearing with the cycles and the treatments because the schedule is creative so let's see this was the date of the plan should be friday four we want to go to may april april april this is april 27 when did we start her on it'll tell us when we started so let's pull up the documents where her prior authorization should be where is our prior authorization approval for chemo drugs let's see where is the rest of the others yeah we should have it's just for some that's okay where is uh reduction where is um okay let's go let's go this 12 let's look at this one yes here they are adam done and then oh and you started a monster right now ben that's that's actually very good to know because this is something we have been telling our clients to use which is very helpful when documenting a prior authorization and uh you know let me sign this i need to put the entity and guidelines so let's go to entity and guidelines so to do that i need to go in here with the chemo regimen is what we want and so let's see where this is yup that's the one done now i'm gonna sign this right i need to just put an approved thats right everything is generated on the computer nothing everything can be added at one place the order can be generated for prior authorization and um even for radiology stuff from the oncology care model so done this the jacobs and i'm gonna sign it that's fine i'm darling what's the rich please verify missing information on deck what do i need to do this uh during operation duration maybe 15 15 minutes so these are the glitches that stop me from doing stuff in the middle of a busy day i understand and this cool the total treatment should be eight treatments it should be approved for so let's change it to 8 not letting me do that right that's that's what i'm actually gonna take a look into that why is it not letting you i you know change it from there however let's see uh let's do this one and then sign maybe nope just a minute just a minute please take your time thank you sure total so let's do it one and sign maybe no it should not be so i don't think so thank you just just a minute please i'm gonna start madison something that says grace has been submitted the response that we need to call anybody i mean i'm asking seattle i don't know this but i'm learning we'll get you we'll get you into the regimen good i've learned five or six things right in the past couple of minutes this is doing good dude i'm a novice hey you're you're teaching a 70 year old sitting here she's sitting here she's my daughter she's sitting here learning it she's legally learning it you're making it so simple that she can understand so we kudos to you and kudos to you and i may have private sessions you're doing it in such a way let me tell you that you're making me interested that's that's very good to know thank you so much i'm not running i don't want to get out of this terror and run to the other room you make me want to learn it so you're a very good teacher thank you so much for that i was supposed to come a little late today but because you know very good but since i'm not used to doing this i may be a better student this is new to me i might be a better sponge you love huh amazing you can learn honey it's not it's not rocket science three weeks learn this that's why i mean i just needed to know how to do that i'm not sure what you mean i'm happy oh no but i don't understand why you're not checking uh doctor i'm i'm gonna take a look into this why is it not letting you sign it here i'm gonna rather create made a big and let me yeah i think this this these are the things so when i'm strapped for time these are the things that um so today it's it's a light day for us so it's quite easy for me to sit down and and i have how about that yes tuesday actually right tuesday three o'clock please very long there for me but three o'clock i'll i'll be drinking pots and pots of coffee and i'll bring my helping my brain well for some reason there is something which maybe i'm missing or is it system or i'm sure it's it's something which i'm missing here uh but i'm i'm gonna take a look at this one in the back end we have saved here so we don't have to do it all over again but let's look at another patient if we have 10 minutes or so sure go ahead let's look at me rickli r i c k l i weekly let's pull him up okay so i think we may have his united healthcare so what was the plan when did we started him on 5 10 so we should have received prior authorization from him on that part so let's go look at it on the oncology care alright c k l i okay so let's look in the documents see there should be a chemo regimen this should be one oh my god see how it scammed okay so where will we find the prior authorization on the chemo arrangement in reference approval for carbon isotope aside so we got it on file photo car boy topside approved hard top aside approved c alright we got one is 48 and the chemo regimen should be in i just want to see where it is it should be 5.18 uh morning okay let's go back approval for carbo it upside this one and chemo regimen was done on five let's see can i just click on done on one yes everything is in here let's play and see i only have two documents maximum only three pdf documents can be attached yeah let's take this thing off they done so it may not this might may not go in there oh we're having issues houston we have trouble okay let's say done okay those two went in and let's get a note get a provider note or a progress note from here and basically yes done and now we have the nbc's we have all of these things total treatments are going to be six is what we want so it's still not doing it i'm gonna take a look at it this one i'm assuming that if this one it has to be scheduled there but i'm gonna take a look into this one okay teach me how to schedule them so i thank you that is good now the question that i have is will this populate into administration part so uh let's approved yes response and it's been approved so the status is approved is what we put in there and there is a usually a time frame when um these are approved or not approved in the time expires so that's where where do i put that one that's the question for you when the p e expires and then the p where to put the pa the number is here and uh you know to and from time can be documented here okay let's go see alright where is this this is approved from 41 to 1 22 11 22 oh 041 what am i doing wrong ben uh can you just from here okay from here okay oh so you got to go to january i don't know should be january december 31 okay so they should be the same again so everything has to be it takes okay good i'm just gonna just put it in there that it expires at time is there an easy way to do it or just this one uh well that isolate since you know this is only the documentation that there is a little mental work i know hey i wanted to get it done past and i'll get it done so and i'll have to march april so what trigger happy here so guys have you ready what's going on i'll be ready for what are we doing is everyone ready for monday go on ahead go do what you need to do i don't need you guys in here with me how do i put the p a number let me look at it let me see i wanna see that how do i pull it up so i have to go back to that other screen ben if i want to look at it sure or maybe you can open up the document if it is there like on the doctor uh you can just you know and you can search you know take a look at the document right there a1235676 709120356 8120356709 what's the review ready for you oh my god i didn't even know and then you can you know uh add a task as well that's awesome 65 2 nice okay let me see let me sign it how about that i really oh well there is something i i really have no two why is it not just not saying cover everything seems to be good let me finish this all right i've written notes on i don't know what nurse okay let's go for 2 1457 melbourne december so let's see if it'll save now and let me sign perfect so there was maybe the time i guess let's go back to the patient here let's try it from here time i i really don't know why should be time so it's important but let's see can you can you talk with the time here let's see authorization and 4 2022 yeah see this time they're a 121840643 hang on a 1214240643 now i'm missing a number 121840643 4 2021 - 4 2022 let's put that in mhm no they didn't do it we schedule we redid everything with doctor hitman and i sent it over to laura yesterday well laura's got it on her desk because i know she had it okay moving right along um 2 14 1957 from melvin valerie and it's been over there for almost two weeks of surely but i don't have any papers okay this has a mind of its own i'm so thrilled hey that's all maybe here on many i just need to check someone is helping me ball b a l l christina and i'm pulling up my other computer on this computer he was a no show yesterday thank you your love and that's all i need okay thank you so the things for me to troubleshoot or find out how many units to put in and what we need to do that that's my job to find out about the unit support and i'll talk to luke about it and try to get that straightened out and then honey well if you're if you're document the nbc the one you're going to use it auto calculates the the units so let's do this let's do let's say for this one which is not appearing it will be that in the back end this must not have the details there which is why it's not how about this one is not because that's something that we don't give here and we don't dispense overall so that's probably why there's a prescription that we already documented okay sure so um so she won't be a she's been approved for it but she won't take it it's a prescription that we give she picks it up from the pharmacy and gets it do you want me to go let's let's finish this one what do you think can i type this september 2022 i'm sure you're happy right now i just want to change this number can i do that there you go much easier for me to do it this way okay i think we're done most of this one do you want me to go ahead and sign it yes wow perfect so it was it was actually the touring from time which we were missing on oh i didn't put the p a number dang it i'll put the p a number up there so how do i do with it so uh can i unsign it yes uh just a minute you're well i'm sure you can unsign it why is it not appearing over here it's uh it's it's okay must be here do i have to create a new one no no we will will definitely see there is a way i can recall it's only done it's been long that i've worked on this one so i just unless we make mistakes we do not learn well i'll try to find out where we used to unsign it from i remember we can unsign it and do it but i'll take a look into this one as well i'll get back to you on tuesday okay you do list alright okay thanks but but you know how can you documented and also it's gonna populate over there let's say there's a drug with you a documented as uh you know prior authorization required whereas it's not documented approved yet so at the time of administration when the nurses documenting that drug this is a will notify that the requirement of prior authorization is important so you want to proceed without that and only if they proceed without that they will be able to do that otherwise not so that's where yes yes yes yes yes that's what we were trying to figure out what we've been struggling for three months trying to figure out what to do and i happened and happened to look at this this and i found it that's why we put the ticket in right that that's amazing that's very good to know that you're trying to learn this however uh about this we get to know if there are any and we need to improve something into our system as well so this is a lot of things which i got to know today which i'm gonna work on and uh we're gonna see how can we improve more things here so let let me call you on tuesday after three and let's have uh sorted other things out and we'll we'll discuss about more things and i'm also gonna show you the scheduling as well absolutely tuesday three pm central standard time you and i have a date that's right so anything else doctor i can assist you take care nothing that's good thank you so much for your time thank you for not a problem you too bye bye bye bye"}}, {"id": 369, "data": {"call_id": "1620408845.77301.txt", "text": "thank you for calling curemd this is brian how may i help you hi brian it's i just called i'm sorry um he hung up um uh the ticket number i have here is 3151314 i believe his name was phil if i'm not mistaken uh you said 315314 31533151314 okay and what was the second thing that you were saying i didn't catch that i'm sorry i think his name was phil if i'm not mistaken i'm not really phill it could be phil becker just give me one moment okay i'm i'm gonna put you on a brief hold while i'm trying to look for the ticket thank you for holding ma'am uh you were talking to pete rogers i'm transferring you over thank you you're welcome no problem alright thank you so much for holding uh please stay online i'll be connecting you shortly you're welcome away from the way that i don't know with my hands i've got two kids and a wife mm yeah thank you so much for staying on the line angila how are you doing yeah sorry to keep you waiting actually i was actually facing some problems with my phone right now so it's fixed now okay so we were at the hicfa and um i was trying to check okay i was actually asking what information they need on the claim because um i can see you're submitting the claim electronically so what npr needs to on the $30 33 box um all the reason why i'm um this just recently started that it's only wait so far but um it's sending out with the with npi one oh one oh 93034 68 that's incorrect it should be sending out with the 114420794 and i do have a hit patient from march 23rd that it was sent out with the one with the correct one and now all of a sudden it's a different one i don't know how that even how did it even switch up like that you know how did it change like that i know like 2 3 weeks ago one of your reps called me because um of the address change i don't know maybe click something so now it was the wrong group supposedly okay thank you i got you so the thing is one 0 93 oh 34688 is your group npi other than that for doctor um doctor low uh you have 1144208794 that's the individual npi so in case if this is the need on the claim i can simply detach the providers from the group so you will be able to submit the claims without this npi you will be submitting the group claims under your individual npi so just give me one second so uh after that you can actually try on your side if the correct npi is now appearing a note give me one moment okay we are all set please check on your end now who is the patient didn't run well i would say yes okay correct okay yeah now i see the 11 i see the correct the individual perfect that's so weird how it changed we never built with that one actually the thing is uh whenever we add the ne new insurance in your practice database what we made sure like um under your group npi they were already groups are created and this is why maybe someone from the development team actually created the group um by considering your um the current your uh i'm sorry the current billing stats and the current billing group so i apologize for that but um the thing is this is how we actually work over here so we were under uh under the impression like if if you have to actually add the group npr over here as well so you can submit the claims on the group because this is what you were doing for the old other insurances so no problem i have now you can submit the claims okay thank you so much i appreciate your help you have a great day have a great weekend you too"}}, {"id": 370, "data": {"call_id": "1622573850.1214805.txt", "text": "hope and healing care how can i help you hi this is abigail can i speak with doctor gondola uh sure abigail give me one second sure hello hi doctor gondola this is abigail how are you hi abigail i'm good how are you i'm fine thank you for asking um i wanted to show you a few changes we have made as discussed on friday you have a minute to take a look sure anydesk yep i have a peer to peer review at two p.m. but should not take more than 2 to 5 minutes i think if you're okay with me going in and out for a couple of minutes that would be fine okay 592 5911 96 thank you so there are two major things um the first thing is was um there were some instructions you wanted to have in the note hold on 592 and then the header (592) 591 191 96 why does it say now it should be okay got it okay so okay let's take a look at the test patient i have not attached that custom form with the with any of the patient yet i wanted your approval first pick chest on open any note hold on okay so we have added a few flags up there and i'll i'll show you how it's gonna show up but first i wanna show you there's something that you wanted right above assessment and plan and where is it okay for now temporarily i am calling it custom complaints but we can rename it so it's gonna open like this and it's gonna say i spend 45 it's just a generic figure you can change it to 35 25 30 and then you can write additional time spend and then you can check these boxes i think i did not have all the check boxes that's all the screen shot it and i believe there were more i'll just screenshot it again i guess the additional ones and that's how it's gonna look like if you want the n c c uh the the hold on did i select multiple uh huh uh do you want it in the form of paragraph or would you like it in the form of pointers i think either way is fine abigail i'm gonna put you on mute for just a few minutes okay sure i have to take this peer to peer can you hear me yeah i'll stay on hold yeah you can mention there's like a discovery questions are not limited to okay um it's gonna be home keep it she just updated that mister common client facing here hi abigail hi hey doctor gondola just give me a few minutes no problem taylor can you do me a small favor can you give this to sophie this is for atifa sultana thank you for staying on hold doctor no problem okay so alright so if it's if paragraph is not an issue we can keep it that way it's just that we needed a few more check boxes so now does it show up as complaint oh yes what we do like to name it we can change it mm pretty miscellaneous yeah really uh i don't know instructions or comments additional comments yeah that should be fine comments or additional comments comments would be fine changed it and what else we have okay so this was one thing major thing and second was the print out so let's take a look oh sorry not quick print so this is not exactly what you said we can we can try and make the one that looks exactly but we need we we'll be needing our um photo shop specialist for that to redo the header but let me see if this one you have to go down and click on the pdf it looks like okay so it's your name last patient's name here mm but then my name shows up on below the patient's name and where is this coming from hold on can we get my patient name about the patient about my name about the patient i think it was the other one can you open okay let me see what went wrong here is the patient team shows below my name just give me a minute i think uh if i do this on my system uh the preview opens within the curemd we don't have to click on pdf and open i would love to see that i don't know why this does it uh i'm gonna open a ticket with the technical team with maybe this is a new one mhm yeah but where did the single hope and healing logo here is the previous one you know you remove the header i think when you did that yeah i did that i i was just want i just wanted to see how it looks but when you include the header the patient is showing up on the left that is what i'm trying to think give me a minute i'm checking it on my screen because here it's easier to open i'm gonna close this can i close it to reopen it just so that it launches within the application instead of pdf yeah sure do you have anything else open on chrome uh let me get rid of everything should i get rid of the other yeah we just wanna reopen chrome i just added an extension for adults okay so now we should be good i'm gonna restart let me let me check hold on let me check settings just one more time go ahead now yeah we're hold on i might close i need us but let's see i'll reopen it um risk curemd can you open curemd please there you go okay alright you too wow can you put your password please i will ask a technical team why is it not opening within in the meantime so this is how the view is gonna be uh header on the top your name on the left and patient's name on the right now this is left this is right no problem okay um so the only thing that idea would be is to move my name on the header with the address of the office and the phone numbers because there's no other place for oh they show up on the bottom i guess if if that is gonna be referring i need mhm sure in the header would be just fine then sure so you can make do with this in the meantime and i will ask uh customization team to put your name make your name part of the header yep sounds good okay and then um um i think let me open my to do list so about the follow up i sent an email that i have um added a follow up flag into your data templates into your note templates yes about the radiology list i still to i'm sorry i was not able to get time to do this because it really requires lots of mental efforts but 80% of it is there i just have to separate uh pet scan and few and mammography and few more no problem okay and then i am gonna add the flag in case i miss something were you able to i was going to say the clinical summary is still a little um it is still not giving the return visit date so if i just put the return visit date and i try to print the summary it does not take it even though you added the follow up here it's still not working now so today i printed it for one patient and it did not work again i'll check so we added comments here is it going it's going to be before assessment and plan all the comments it looks like you added it there i just did and i think we don't need to hard code your name here it's gonna show up anyway initial hematology so there are two notes initial hematology follow up and the third one is office with it and the same for all i'm gonna put you on mute for a couple of minutes"}}, {"id": 371, "data": {"call_id": "1621968433.1055775.txt", "text": "wellness oncology this is diana hi diana this is pet i'm calling from curemd can i speak with crystal to whom crystal is

schedule a go to meeting session with you on board with the technical team it's just really hard because i travel with doctor montgomery and i'm not in one place every day all right all right that's

i scan it was scanning in like four different files like one page but it was all scanning together right um were you placing pages in between because whenever the scanner detects a blank page it cuts off the scanning process and creates a new files so if you have three blank pages in between it will be creating four files cutting all of them like three times creating four separate files like a procedure report what's the name of your scanner that you're using um it's the d s five oh nfc scanner i don't see it connected right now and check the usb cable connection yeah i don't know what happened i just restarted my computer you know what hold on second let me turn it back on showing up on the computer okay you should be able to scan from it now can you give it a try again yeah do you

placed on the scanner can you please confirm that sorry your voice is breaking hold on 1 second no actually it's only six pages you put six pages on the scanner okay are they single sided pages are

there now okay thank you so much please place a papers on the scanner again it's scanning 10 pages are you sure that there are six pages or only six pages you see this blank it's scanning this blank scanning the back of it i'm i'm sorry i can barely hear you i'm i'm sorry can you uh come a bit near the phone the back of the beach exactly your your scanner is scanning these lengths that's why it's splitting the file uh into uh there is no blank page in between the backside is blank off the pages so why is it scanning the back that's that's a mystery yeah i'm i'm changing the scanner to scan the front side only can you try placing all these papers upside down i think we're placing them up side down what do you mean yeah i mean the the the way you're inserting them into the scanner just flip them okay so instead of okay um okay and as you can see i have this setting that's a single side so we are scanning single side over here lets see here we go it scan six pages this time let's see okay let's check mm yeah they are back yeah they are so i can affect can you can you rotate them again i mean they are they're coming up upside down can you try to um you know change their orientation to the right way yeah and that'll do it let's try once again email it's going beyond than that senior scanners confirmation um do you have any um other papers available any other paper like three or 4 pages yes let me see hit the scan button and see if they get scanned correctly are the single sided or their double yes they are single sided okay you have four pages on it yes here is only four pages scan perfectly yeah may be its just the paper can you put those papers in the same manner as you did on this and can you make sure that none of those six pages has double sides i think the first page has two sides no i'm i mean there's the front page and there is a second page and in the back of blank and then the second page is the front the back is like the third page in front the bucket link so should i only put three let's try that these four pages scanned correctly so i'm wondering if those six pages have some problems with the scanner only pitch three oh yeah paper because it can for pages yep so can you remove the first page and again all the other five yeah just take the first page out and scan all the other five pages take your first page out scan all the other five pages they're all linked it's scanning two sides of those pages something is not right uh let me let me open this page can you take this page off yes just take this page off try to delete this one too yes okay okay try again nope it's doing the same thing yeah i think it is the paper because all the other ones like the other procedures i don't have a problem with i don't know if that could be mhm do do you think that these pages look different are they a bit ticker than the regular pages or paper feels different it feels a little bit different and it has images on it um like i can feel like it does oh okay i see let me check this as well let's see mhm um yeah let me check this last thing maybe if that will fix it okay put all these six pages on the scanner again and try scanning nope it's doing the same thing i can do it like if it's just gonna be on on this type of paper and that's fine because i don't get very often um i just don't want it to be a problem with the other ones can i try to scan like a couple of the other other type of paper to see if it works um yes please try try the regular ones so that we can see if uh they are working okay okay that looks perfect created one of one

on a note alright would it be conveniently possible for you to do a remote session so that i can confirm you about that no my laptop doesn't have access for that uh alright let me try to confirm you the other way around so once give me one moment please do you want to change a provider for already created a note i mean the note which is already created or you want to change the provider and the new one that's already been created alright give me one moment let me confirm that i'm looking into it please give me one moment i'm so sorry it's taking a little time i'm just trying to confirm this on my end because the reason as for my best experience once a provider note is created you cannot change the provider however i'm trying to just verify this on my end alright thanks uh no yes the provider can be changed all right when you open the note under the field which says save sign print assign send file review create super bill and delete there is a tiny orange bar with an arrow facing downwards if you click that bar it will open up the uh provider note uh specifications and from there you can change the provider okay for me it's showing it's gray it's not letting me change it i unsigned the note do i have to do anything else uh we have to do is just make sure that the note is not signed because is it signed no in that case can i please request you to log a support ticket so that we can further investigate you probably it could be a reason that your profile does not have the relevant um permissions available and we will fix this for you to do it uh to do it now i have to take care of it oh i'm afraid but we need to have the support ticket because we would be requiring your consent to give you these permissions so over the phone it would be a little you know hard for me to give you the permissions so if you can just log the support ticket we will take care of it and we'll get back to you as soon as possible alright thanks for your help today no problem thank you

laurie hi yes this is laurie how are you i'm good how are you good uh actually i was calling in regarding two of your issues so first one is for the s uh the missing eras did you get my email um i sent it to yolanda kept you in the c c yes yep um i have to yep we got your email about the missing but there's still those other ones missing well you know uh i spoke yeah i spoke with the you know the clearing house team so they told me like for example if the era is coming in maybe for example today is june 1st so probably if it is not synched in by tomorrow or day after tomorrow just wait for one more day it will sing then so i said okay it makes sense because you know probably the thinking might take a day or two but about the eras those are not coming in after a week or maybe 10 days so that's a problematic one so they said okay for the humana if it is possible if it is possible for humana if you can fetch the eobs or you get me the any example eobs for me because you know humana they only cater request when we have the eobs with us and then we can you know put in a request to them that you know there's a delay in the era transmission to the system so then they start working in a request okay so you need an example of a paid humana eob uh mm the check number that you have shade did you get the for those or not can you get the you be for those eras like the paper in the paper form or from the portal anywhere um okay he's from like a on our own is that how you got that 1 yeah we would have to have someone download them for us no worries take your time whenever you get that no worries you can give me one or two examples so we can i think i have one example is that the one right now i have one example here um august okay mhm uh okay do you want the check number what would you need off of here have 1 1 example just uh if it is possible if you can take a picture a screenshot and send it to me oh yeah i can scan it and how do you want me to send it just send it to my email just send it to my email okay now for your ticket you have logged in for duplicate the eras from n g m insurance just yeah just jam yes so i've seen that issue and uh believe me yeah it is strange it looks great uh you know out of the box thing that you know we have never seen such thing in our system so what i've done i have uh forwarded it uh to my clearing house team and so it is the technical team at the same time so that they can see if there is something wrong with the insurance company or maybe the transmission from the insurance company has been done in this way so they're gonna look into it okay they will find out if there is something wrong within the application so they'll fix it otherwise if this is something that you know that was done during the transmission from the insurance company uh i'm afraid that might not be you know our you know our thing to fix because you know some time what happens then probably we will we will report the insurance company that okay this is happening with one or two of our eras just make sure if there is some error in the system so make sure it is fixed so that you know this won't happen again but if it is uh as i mentioned if it's the application glitch or something we'll fix it on our own okay so just wait until forwarding that to what team clearing house team basically all the insurance communication that needs to be done or you know that is channeled through the clearing house team so they actually look into this uh technical things uh whenever it comes to the claims and the eras okay to just wait for a day back after on monday i'll get back to you on monday okay okay anything else or any other issue that you're facing right now um yes so my other question it's more of a question i guess maybe an issue but i mean this goes back to december where we were setting up our eras um to be submitted and it looks like watching was all completely set up but branzburg is still like njm is still not electronic what else is still not electronics american health like we were doing them all at the same time and um let me find my note and um it seems like the ball was dropped on on the branch berg side when everything i just have to find my notes of who i talked to you can do one thing like for example if there is a list of insurances for which you guys are not receiving the eras to share it with me for branzburg and if any information that is required from your side maybe the portal logan's or maybe any form that need to be signed i'll forward it to you or and you know i'll proceed with the request yeah i mean this goes back to december 8th of speaking with p at 10 business days i spoke with him two different two different occasions so okay so maybe on the same email i'm gonna attach this we can list what still is not going electronically for branchburg uh would it be uh is it possible that you know we can create a separate thread for the enrollment because you know we're gonna say you know follow up on that enrollment email later on as well so let's not to confuse if it is possible that would be helpful for me for having separate thread for enrollment and then for the eras so you want a separate ticket or just not not the ticket i'm talking about the email uh thread right now we have one active thread uh for missing jerry's so the eob that you want to attach you can attach to that email and create a new email for the new enrollment for branchburg and just attach the list of insurances and i'll respond accordingly that what i need for these enrollments okay alright that makes sense alright thank you so much anything okay and then um no i think that's it for now and then i'll just wait to hear back after your team looks into the issue yeah definitely i will get back to you on monday i'll call you and what is the best time to call um usually you know when you are available um i would say between nine and four and i can give you the direct extension for me we share one extension sure we have a phone we didn't have one extension 146 146 let me note this down yeah this is for both of us yep goes right got it okay 146 okay have a great weekend you too bye bye okay bye

configuration tab accessibility something like that okay um would it be like on the actual website i am not seeing it on the software itself why i am just not seeing it um let me see so it says that your desk can be accessed to this address um oh access do you see any settings tab on your right top corner maybe any tree line no um let me see oh here we go settings once you are there can you see any option uh related to privacy okay and once you click on it uh you see on your left hand side there should be some tabs accessibility uh full desk access or screen recording uh yeah i see yeah user name user image recording individual settings right so uh can you click on accessibility mm i am not seeing that so there is no security and privacy settings uh so there is a security setting and it says interactive access unattended access anything related to privacy um privacy gives me the user name the user image recording an individual setting right can you click on a privacy okay privacy and now uh do you see accessibility or something in the options no access control like access control list maybe can you click on it uh do you see any anydesk tab on your right hand side where it is grayed out or something okay actually i need access for your computer and uh on macbook uh there is uh normally uh restricted settings so i just need to enable anydesk for that okay let me see it is an option of security and privacy and then you can click on privacy and this is like in the actual software itself correct that is right it is not on the website on the actual software okay um yeah i am just not seeing it uh would it be on the actual would it be on the actual mac itself that i could do this on the software itself um so when you go to settings what options do you see uh user interface i see security i see privacy audio connection vpn can you click on privacy okay and what exactly it gives me user name so i can change the account user name or make it custom i can click click a user image um it gives me the option to hide account image or customized then it gives me recording which gives me a check box to automatically record incoming sessions or and automatically record outgoing sessions and then it says individual setting use default setting or remember individual settings for each desk so uh if you click all those options any of those options uh you do not see anydesk somewhere mm no okay just give me 1 second let me see if i can find anything okay so i am not sure um about that uh can you tell me what exactly the issue is maybe i can do it uh on my end and see if i can so um my problem is is when i am going into the schedule and i am trying to print off stuff for the braces um it is not allowing me just a quick print from my computer it has to be done at a different computer and when i am clicking print it just it does not even acknowledge that it is not printing or anything it just does not do anything okay so once once you go to the scheduler tab uh you click on any patients name uh what is the workflow exactly so you go into the scheduler tab and what exactly did you do next um so i will click on the patients name and then i will click edit note and then um i i check mark the paper that i am giving them the form that i am giving them so i am giving them the um dmi proof of delivery and instructions for use and it brings up the form just fine um it is just when i simply go to print it just does not acknowledge that i am clicking print if that makes sense okay um in order to check that because you have all the required access i still need to connect with your screen um just give me one moment so when you go to anydesk again uh do you see any system preferences option let me try check it no like on the actual website uh no on the uh on the software itself okay it is just not pulling up uh do you see um okay just give me a second so there is no tab where you can where it says configure permissions and you click on configure it just is so i pull it up and it says remote desk please enter the address of the remote desk you would like to access and it says your desk can be accessed with this address and it says any desk status configure configure permissions is that it yes can you click on configure then its uh does it say open system preferences uh yes okay so once you are there top four tabs where the privacy tab is there as well yep can you click on privacy okay now on your left hand side you should be able to see accessibility yes and on your right hand side you will see anydesk and that any desk is grayed out correct correct can you check that option for me um it just highlights it in purple it does not let me check it okay so uh all the way down below you will see a lock option uh right so you need to click on it uh in order to give those permissions and then you simply need to check anydesk and after accessibility there is full desk access you can click on that and then check anydesk again then there should be system recording uh you can check anydesk and that is it let me know what all good uh let me try to access your screen and see if oh it just popped up again okay it is loading now all right i can see your screen uh kayla uh if you can take me to curemd application please okay we can just move this on the side go ahead can you show me um so you go to scheduler okay and then when i go here and then i go to print i quit quit print so i got to print it and actually it is never made it this far before so i do not know what is going on maybe maybe i do not even need you i am sorry let me let me go see if this printed okay yep it did not print and then print so it keeps on loading mhm okay and you are is there any printer attached with this particular computer uh the printer is just the one that is up at the front desk i am not sure mhm just give me a second okay lets go back to the scheduler lets say this is the patient so you click on it and then you click on uh patient demographics or what exactly do you click uh edit note i am sure uh huh yep alright you go to edit note and this is the note and then you click on file or no are you report and then you click on quick print and the printer option is grade out right oh yeah that is that is where it was and then i think it is supposed to be that h t m l mhm you can probably just click one of those and try to print it try going to the title maybe i do not know i got a dmi note maybe that is where i always go to print stuff i do not know anything else about the other top and then it should okay just give me one second i am just checking something on my end as well i might have to uh involve the technical team just give me a minute let me see if they are available now we are not even getting that message the quick print one yeah i am just checking with the technical team kayla just give me a minute okay kayla could you do one thing hello yep uh can you just uh sign out of your curemd from safari and log into chrome this was the patient correct and this is chrome right yup okay okay can you please open the same page again uh where you were signed in i minimize that page sure i think this is chrome right yes this is chrome um yep and then do you want me to go back into the patient as well alright um actually i am only able to see the login page i am not able to see the during the application oh um okay i will just exit out and try again and you want me in chrome right right please okay let me exit out and calls alright so do you see this option print here should i just go ahead and click on print yeah i am gonna see if it prints out here at the front uh give me a second so do you think that you will only be able to do this through chrome or can we get it through safari too uh actually i think this particular feature is not compatible with safari uh you can just click on quick print and then you can click on this print option right uh on your right hand side up top so that was the that is the only uh uh where you can do it so it is not uh uh i think working on uh safari at the moment that is what we have been told okay um cool uh so that means i will just have to get everything moved over from safari than to the chrome previous employees uh yes you can ask everybody uh who are not able to use this option they can use chrome and chrome is much faster and you should be all right uh they can simply log in by uh putting in the cloud address and they should be good okay awesome um so i will just uh go ahead and close the ticket uh let us know if there is any more issues okay okay um and you said just to switch everything from safari over to chrome it would just be me entering in and uh the cloud email uh no actually it is uh not moving everything from safari to chrome you can simply just type in the web address and everything should be there on chrome oh okay awesome and whoever wants awesome yes whoever wants to use the print option okay only you can ask them to uh sign into chrome and they can easily print it from there okay perfect alright got it okay perfect safari let us know if there is any more issues okay alright thank you take care bye

so i'm trying to print the this one so this is not the one i want i want the prescription pad so it should be this one uh i don't think you can print it from here give me one second let me let me take control for one second please oh sorry its okay yeah that one the first one there you go you need to select it and print it i'll tell you exactly the status and the detail with the company yeah but no i don't want that one i want the prescription so this this is the medication that was prescribed yes you want the you want the receipt no i want the prescription pad i don't could i show you yeah go ahead and tell me the doctor is the one that does here let me go do who has one uh where did i to go to check which patient i downloaded their prescription do you know what's the doctor's name though doctor kang and i have to see who i have a prescription that i did if i already uploaded a prescription because if you do not have the prescription permission it's not gonna allow you to do that yeah um but it used to be able to print it and she told me uh printed out today so i can't okay but let me ask her because you know how when she writes a prescription and then she correct so um it's on there so like that one that she did yesterday she forgot to print it and she told me to print it which i can't so i can't do that then let me you're gonna need permission for that but give me one second let me test something because i think i used to be able to do it possible it just disappeared there's a possibility that it could be that somebody updated your profile so go ahead and log out and log back in and then try again and what was the name of the patient again so i can test on my end as well please account number 2600 2600 yeah do you want me to log back in now uh go ahead okay plus that wasn't the only issue i was gonna call about today too okay go ahead and try now please okay okay oh there it is okay yeah so let's see if that works oh yeah there it is okay yes okay um it was just the permission uh okay so i was wondering because um i could use to do it before and i can okay one more thing um on the calendar when i put in here let me go back so here if a patient reschedules or changes edits their appointment sometimes i can't see the reason i cannot change that so some people have to change it as a just a tally you know instead of a follow up treatment i can't i don't know why because you don't you don't have the permission that's why it looks like somebody yeah somebody has changed your permissions i would uh if you don't mind can you um because we need something writing for this that you are requesting these changes to be done uh is there any way i can talk to the doctor or the office manager the second they gave me permission or logging ticket that you're requesting this norris doctor kang and the exam room doctor kang in the exam room okay okay so she's with a patient right now what i can do is call you back when she's available later or you can send her an email for permission and then she will just reply back no problem but uh melissa how it works is you need to or the doctor needs to log a support ticket from your end we cannot ask for the permissions to be given to any employee okay because it's the permission and consent has to come from the either the doctor themselves or the office manager yes you guys need to initiate that request okay yeah but can she do it verbak when i call you later if you can we recommend because we need something document as a document that is written that you are asking for these as a proof so if you can if you can log a ticket and just say like you're requesting you need these permissions we can definitely go ahead and click on support and then log a ticket okay and this is where you need to log a ticket so we can actually go ahead and update the tickets for you update the i'm sorry the permissions for you okay she just said i have permission and then yeah you can you please give permission to melissa for this purpose and then you have to select the module type and severity make sure the correct email address phone number and best time and we'll get it done it's pretty simple okay i'll let her know all of it then alright okay thank you so much you're welcome anything else i can help you with no that would be it today thank you you're welcome have a wonderful day you too

a conference room listening together on a large screen so laurie be our pharmacist is here alright awesome so everybody from the union side is there to attend the meeting and learn the inventory um it's just two of us that are learning so yeah okay awesome so here's what's gonna happen so for the inventory training wernon is the guy wernon is basically gonna walk you through all of the work flows for the inventory and stuff from curemd side is pretty much just scanning the barcode and you know a little bit of that uh uh how do you see the scanning within the immunization how do you see it within the medication and i'll just cover up you know i'll probably take 5 to 10 minutes just to show you how the ndc works and it's not gonna take long you know while wernon is doing his stuff i'll just go from there so if you guys want us to record the session let me know um yes that would be great um like we're just working with volume we're working with um we just had the volume through the computer inference recorded environment 100% really low i'm thinking we might be calling on phone sure you can just dial in uh the meeting has the dial in you know details as well but is your uh computer has enough battery for the session yes and if not i've got my cord with me so i can plug in we're we're dialing it now so once we do i'll meet my computer and yeah you'll have to yeah otherwise it'll be a lot of echo in there and uh wendy standards and one of our nursing supervisors also has has joined us um the phone just had to be plugged in so we're just waiting for it to warm up okay no problem my understanding was it was mhm okay what is it too too far your what 34 12 like can you hear us now yes you just need to uh mute your computer so if there is no echo this is better a little bit better i don't have i don't i'm not listening to myself twice so i think we're good vernon you want to try now wait i just talk or yeah yeah just have a quick chat and yeah i think we're good now don't hear myself yeah you are uh i made you an organizer so you can start the training any time alright perfect um were you gonna yeah you already started recording it too nice mhm i didn't share my screen okay perfect you guys see this i'm seeing it elaine are you bye this is very small sorry bye so on the go to meeting you'll see uh buttons on the right if it's small you can zoom in with those button that says plus and minus okay we'll just have to scroll up and down the full screen okay is that better or like are you okay with that vernon if you can just do me a little bit just a bit they'll make you you know what i don't know no no no no no no no it's not the go to meeting not to go to meeting just your browser just hit the control but then i'm saying yeah um yeah like on this page i can put on the next uh i'm gonna go ahead and get started and then i'll show you no if you just hold your hold your control button and then move your mouse cursor it will zoom in and out itself you don't have to do anything okay okay great i think we're good now okay so okay no problem so this is where it begins of course curemd and we're gonna be focusing on up here at the top right is the inventory button and like black mention before only your license users will have access to this i'm gonna go ahead and click it it's gonna bring up our inventory module um how does this look does this look okay for you as far as the size yeah it looks all right to me if you want you can zoom in here if you want a little more for you too alright so if you notice here at the top you have your category tabs here and then within each tab you have a navigation panel here on the left okay so we're gonna be focusing on three tabs in here on the data receive and reports tab and i wanna start with data um data is basically your foundation or your yeah your database basically um and as far as for your products this is where everything starts so this is our test account and we have over 500 products listed in here um most likely you won't have that much but this is basically where you tell your inventory module this is what we are planning on having an inventory as far as counts and everything so you set it up here and then you go to receive tab that's where you enter in your number so i'm gonna show you how it looks here um so there's two ways of adding a product here in your database you can either um did add record or there's a spreadsheet what you guys did in the very beginning where we added your products spreadsheet i think back in august is when we initially started this um so i'm gonna go ahead and just bring up a product and show you how it looks once it's set up in here the box is still in here so when you hit this um ad record but it's gonna take you to this screen so i'm just gonna use the marks because it's all filled in but all this information so many blank so everything is highlighted in blue is necessary information okay um and then there is another field in here that's equally as important that you had to have it i'm gonna show you in a second here so when i start at the top so product type uh prescription drug or vaccine that's mainly what you guys will be working with this is a prescription drug of course description the name of the product um and then the trade name and generic name not necessary but you can't fill those in if you want this will show up on the rx label um unit sales price would be zero the code is a unique number for the product doesn't have to be anything particular but it has to be unique to each product that is in your database so we recommend even though it's not here because it's a test account we recommend using a 10 digit ndc number here um doesn't have to be anything particular but 10 digit ndc rule um make it unique to where it doesn't you don't have a duplicate code number for the product uh product bar code not necessary but you can use this this is the manufacturer bar code you can use this for receiving reasons i'll show you later what it looks like um you don't have to have it of course but um it does help with your workflow especially if if you're using a scanner um i'll show you how that works in a second here okay so again this is the manufacturer barcode if you want to use it um for receiving reasons do you have a couple other fields like your manufacturer you can set your manufacturers here on your left and then that way this is this will help with reports when you're running reports um you can search by manufacturer this is something that is not necessary but it does help if you want to use manufacturers as a category um and then the last important with two last important fields ndc number even though it's not how i did um this is necessary you have to have the 11 digit ndc number for that product here okay um if you don't know how to get the 11 digit ndc number if if you're probably gonna come up 10 10 digits on the on it um but i can show you how to do that if you're if you do know how that's fine um but again this has to be 11 digit ndc number without dashes of course you use the ashes up here for the code for the 10 digits but here it has to be just 11 digit without dashes does that make sense yeah nice okay and again um also you can stop me at any moment if you have any questions or from going too fast or if you need to go back over anything last section on this page is gonna be units of measure so this is pretty simple the only you're only gonna mess with the first two um the first two categories under this um under this um the units of measure the container is gonna be what you are dispensing or administering from okay so we are dispensing from a bottle and then in that bottle is 100 tablets that will will be dispensing so depending on the sig let's say if you're doing um you know one a day for 10 days then you're dispensing 10 tablets to that patient okay if you're expensing a full bottle then obviously the bottle comes in a package or a box so this will be box and maybe one bottle okay if you're if you're administering a vile this will be the the container the vial comes in so a boxer package the box or package and then the units of measure would be how many vials are in that package okay if it's a multi dose vials and this will be viable because you're dispensing i'm sorry administering of from a vial and then however many units you have in that vial like if it's the madonna i'm gonna be vial six units does that make sense yeah okay alright so again this is what you're dispensing or administering from and this is what you are administering or dispensing right here the last important section here under your um one question just make sure because i think that we have time there's sometimes when we we have a bottle of 100 pills that each time when we are administered to patients we are just giving them a one time dose of other times when there's a bottle of pills and we're giving the patients the entire bottle one of those corporations i mean whether we're just gonna in the end give the patient the entire bottle or in the end only give the patient a portion of that bottle and those are just on both of those situations be documented the same yeah you know um it's just you know depending on like if that bottle was never partially dispense then you just set up as per bottle you know but partially dispensing i guess depending on the situation um so when you go instead of you're sick you just put however many tablets you're giving them if it's just a full bottle so you're giving him 100 tablets it'll dispense out of that bottle you know so that way you have the ability to dispense the full bottle you said you have to put you know the full amount of tablets or you can put you know the partial dispense so you just have that option if it's never if it's never going to be partially dispensing you might as well just set it up as you know you might as well set it up as per bottle you know or you don't dispense the tablets itself but if it has that possibility then you want to set up like this where you have the container as a bottle the units 100 tablets does that make sense so if i'm gonna be dispensing entire bottle in my um the entire bottle then and my container is gonna be the box that it comes in and my unit measurement is gonna be a bottle but if i'm gonna be discussing just still is gonna be the bottle of my unit measurement is gonna be the tablet exactly uh huh exactly so we have the inventory we have to be aware of how we're gonna be in the end dispensing yeah um normally most of our and set up like this um or it's a bottle and then however many tablets um blake have you we can definitely i'm gonna test it out just to make sure just to make sure that the the curious i can i can see it right there but excuse me dry as far as saying what you know one bottle but um but most of the time it's set up like this where the bottle and then however many tablets and then depending on you know if you have to dispense the full bottle you just put how however many tablets you know giving them if it's 100 tablets you know you just put that in your oh you're sorry and like i'll show you what yeah i'll show you what it looks like when we go to expense it do a test expense does that answer your question i think so okay okay do you have any issues or anything when you if you guys set up anything understand blake and blake would definitely um assist to reach out to me if you need any assistance with that um okay and then the last important part here is gonna be under your billing tab at the top this is very important for your your e super bill and this is where you're gonna put your procedure code slash cpt code for each product and if you need assistance with that blake will definitely assist you with this so um over here the billing code is basically if you use one of the codes here like if it's added here when you administer the vaccine or you dispense that medicine within the provider note this code will be transferred over to your super bill as well alright perfect so this is how you set up your products um this is not this has nothing to do with numbers is just setting up the actual database um of your products and that's pretty much it for the data tab um that you will mainly be using it's just this list products unless you're gonna use manufacturers or vendors or anything like that but um it's just you know pretty much just the only section you'll be messing with is your products so now we're gonna jump over if you have any other questions you wanna jump over to your receipt tab and this is where your numbers come into play so we're gonna start accepting products in so i'll begin to the top on navigation side receiving inventory so like i mentioned before you have two ways to bring up your product um to receive so you have your product barcode which the manufacturer barcode or you can look up look it up by product and just type in the product name so if you wanted to use the manufacturer barcode like i mentioned before you would just scan it here and it'll bring it up on the tablet or you can just simply type that in and then bring it up you have two options it just depends on your workflow how you guys wanna do it um but either way it works um so here we have our product is selling 500 mg and as you can see it comes in a bottle of 100 tablets i'm gonna go ahead and just receive two bottles here and and then you also need to put in your necessary information like your lot number expiration date a lot types programs select some random stuff here so after you get all your necessary information in you hit this button right here at the bottom left at the batch and as you can see it's gonna add it down here at the bottom so you can keep going if you have other product to accept in so i'm gonna go ahead and accept it a vaccine here and then this vaccine this vaccine is set up per uh per box and each each box has 10 viles so i'm gonna just accept two boxes which you give us 20 viles total and go ahead and put in a lot number and other important information and then at the batch and then add it down here at the bottom alright and just a little side note which is you know it's probably pretty probably common sense but just to make sure um if you were to get let's say two different uh marks or two different lot numbers obviously you would just accept in the first one with um the same number and then do another product um different boxes selling with that a lot of separate lot number so it'd be two different categories down there for that one or whatever product it is um after you get everything added down here this button here it says next step go ahead and hit it it's something page basically just confirming that this is what you're gonna be accepting in you have the ability because you are products the inventory module does print custom barcodes which is how you attract the inventory and which is also what you will use you will use when dispensing out of cure um you have the ability to print those here um but do not print them here nothing will happen if you do um but a lot of clients especially when they're new to use the module they make the mistake of not doing this posting them into inventory so they have the barcodes when they go dispensing to dispense or administer that product is not finding it in cure because they haven't done this part so don't print them here um just go ahead and just post them first and then there you go you have the ability to bring your barcodes here so you have you can print them here individually or you can just click this button and print the full batch so what it looks like and there we go we have our two bottles with this one right here and then we have our two boxes of varicella um also side note if you notice they are pretty much similar except for the last number meaning that you know obviously this is the one bottle for the other bottle just make sure that whatever bottle that you're dispensing out of is the one you're scanning because you can make a mistake to think that these are the same numbers it isn't um and if you were to get out of one and take from the other it'll definitely throw off the inventory and it causes a headache adjusting those things back to make sure whatever you're dispensing from doing you're scanning same thing with the with any product go ahead and just copy that for now i'm gonna show you what looks like we spent out of cure okay so there we go so we know we we've we've we've accepted inventory in and after setting it up in our data data uh data record you wanna move on to this next one here that says un posted batches so let's say you make the mistake you forget to posted the inventory or anything you maybe you stepped away while you were receiving a batch you know you had to help a teammate or a client um the inventory module does uh track your progress so if that was the case you can always come back and find um the one that you were uh if you can see we have a ton here most likely you won't have this situation star test account but you would just find that product this little pencil button here and it'll take you back to where you left off all your products will be listed here at next step and then post post that into the inventory and post that those products into inventory so again that's under un posted batches so it does track your progress even if you if you were to have printed the bar code didn't post them come here find it posted and then those barcodes should be good um the inventory modules shouldn't update those barcodes it's safe it was like a week later um but i would always verify to make sure the barcodes that um that you printed originally a week before um matches the ones that you um that you have now when you post it if that makes sense please get that button does it highlight what where you left off or exactly yeah so it'll have everything that you left off on down here and then you would just if you need to receive more you can keep going if not you can sit next step and post it okay nice you know yeah it's here on on posted batches uh next one that's um that uh you you'll be um interested in is the reprint labels um exactly what it is you just come here find a date that you received the product which you wanna do today the uh fourth hit search and it will bring up that product with my son and our receive today you can go here and reprint those labels okay pretty this is pretty basic as far as reprinting labels you also have another section where you can reprint labels it's gonna be here search barcodes so this one has a lot more criteria to search by um you can search by products uh you can search by a lot number um you also can search by uh the receipt date too so we're gonna do today which is the 4th search and there we go so this is what we received in today we have a two box two bottles of amoxicillin two boxes of varicella okay you also have some other options you can do here so as you can see if you also can see the barcode numbers itself you have the ability to see if that product is still indispensable and you can also print your barcodes here you can select them all and print them all at once if you want to you also have a couple other things you have the ability to discard and merge i'm sorry to discard and recall that product now you also can let's say if you were receiving in a product and you accidentally put in the wrong information like a lot number expiration this is where you're gonna go to make that switch that fixed so you would just find that product barcode you would click this button here and then you can come in and make the modification if you mess up the lot number type program any of that stuff you can come in and make the modification um it's very important to do that adjustment immediately if you notice a mistake um because once you have dispense administered from that product you can't come back and make any of those modifications to make sure that if you catch a mistake or anything you need to come do it immediately before you dispense or administer from that product you also have another section here where you can make adjustments to the units you know stuff happens um let's see if you use some of those tablets are dropping the floor lost this is where you would come in and make that adjustment if you if that were uh was the case okay so that so if you need to do that you just put in whatever the amount is now it's safe and then there we go now we only have 90 units available okay um also two very important this field should only be used to adjust down never used to just up okay this is only to make adjustments if something has been lost or or miscounted um do not adjust up if you were to have like i said if you find those 10 tablets again what you would do is you just go back to your receive tab i'm sorry you received inventory and find you know uh bring up that product and basically it's been re receiving those 10 tablets so you would put quantity of bottle and then only 10 tablets that makes sense okay so basically you were you would receive it in if you were to find inventory after discarding it okay nice perfect alright let me go back to here so um yeah that's pretty much it here and also too um let's just go back to our there we go so now as you can see i made that adjustment now it's only 90 units available in the bottle um if you were to include this out i need to discard or recall a products you just find that product by either product name or barcode you can put it here bring it up here if you notice here there's a ton of maximums that aren't invincible the inventory model does track product you know basically forever you know for report reasons um but if you wanna make this field a lot clearer you can just hit this button here it says sensible only his third bring up only the product you have it in its dispensable so let's say if you need to recall a product um let's see let me just go ahead and bring up a random one here um you basically find that barcode um click the barcode number and either recall or discard i'm gonna go ahead and recall one it'll ask for the reason and your reason there after you put that in it'll discard it and i'll give you the discarded reason here now that bottle of amoxicillin is no longer dispensable perfect okay alright so that's pretty much it for this uh part as far as looking at your barcodes again um yeah this is where you can this is where you get more detail if you need to reprint barcodes you can do that but you also get more details to your barcode to go in and make adjustments um yep and that's it so i wanna move forward if you have any other questions or anything here i'm gonna move forward to our last section of receipt tab which is create stock counts okay this is where you are going to be able to reconcile your inventory to make sure what you say you have in the inventory um module matches with what you have in your pharmacy okay so you would just basically type in your products you've been working with amoxicillin so let's just stay with that selected it creates the account and this is what we inventory module saying that we should have in our pharmacy so if you notice here it says we have 12 inventory records that have not been verified all you're gonna do is go get that product and you're gonna scan each barcode to go ahead and start scanning have a scanner work from home type them in here but as you scan as you see the list gets shorter which is a good thing that means you're accounting for this inventory i'm gonna do several more here you one more alright there we go so now our list is only two left so let's see if this was the case you can't find those products um after you go ahead and stand all your inventory that you do have you would just hit this button update inventory it will let you know it'll prompt you that these last two barcodes will not be uh dispensable or removed from the inventory it okay and now your inventory is up to date for that product okay if you start start sorry you're verifying if you're if you're verifying let's say you're about to scan one that says it was a a box of 100 are you also kind of before you scan that box are you looking at the box verify that yes there are like it is still full it's the longer in there and then scan it i would recommend do that just you know regardless you um you can't modify the number within that bottle but at least you can you can account for that barcode but if you do see that the number is off then obviously you will go back to that section i showed you before search barcodes you will go back here look up that barcode in particular so it was um this bottle you would scan it here look it up this is where you would come in and make an adjustment to the units if if it was off so let's create the account will account for the barcode itself if the inventory is off inside of that bottle then you will come back to search barcodes and make the adjustment here that makes sense i mean as you're reconciling and scanning you're not just remember you're also kind of verifying that the quantity correct yeah yeah i would definitely recommend doing yeah that um that process that you know while you're scanning you can also make sure that the the the numbers the units inside are correct if you were to catch that you make the adjustment here on the search barcodes creates this is more of just making sure that barcodes are there but the numbers if the units are often you'll come back here to make the adjustment of the units after your account for the barcode nice okay yeah perfect so yeah i mean i mean it kinda makes it you know obviously you wanna um if you know knock out two birds one stone if you're accounting for the barcode you might as well account for the units inside you right so that kinda kind of helps you guys out with your workflow if you're not gonna both out at one time um and then also too that say if you uh were to start a stock count and you know get pulled away for whatever reason um you can go back um again the module does track your progress so you would come here to list stock counts find the one who uh that you started we have a ton here most likely this won't be the case with you guys where you will find the one that you started um like hit the pencil button and then there we go you can you can finish where you left off and that's under list accounts so you don't lose your your progress nothing nothing worse than starting uh start counting like 100 products and then you i can't finish and start over again you can always finish where you left off here um that's pretty much it for the receipt unless you have any other questions let me go back over anything i think we're good nice okay perfect so the last section here under your inventory is gonna be reports reports is exactly what it says it's just running reports and seeing what you have and what you have done um this is one section that you can come in and play around with and not mess with inventory so i definitely recommend using this a lot of our clients use this in different ways depending on what reports they need and each report is gonna be exportable to excel you need to send that stuff off to anybody also to uh the excel sheets have a little more information and clarity on it when you um bring up each report i'm gonna start here at the top inventory exactly what it is is what you have so you can either search you know enter in the search criteria here or you can just leave it blank it hit search you have the ability to view active only you also have the ability to view only what you have in stock so anything that is not in stock you click this button here it search and then it'll just filter it out so now it's showing only what you have in stock and what you have on hand um yeah let's see that's pretty much it so yeah this is pretty straightforward inventory inventory you have the ability to search by lot number i'm sorry by a lot it type itself um if you use the manufacturer reporting or manufacturer i mean the data tab you can also search by manufacture of course um recall items so we did a recall today so you can definitely run a report for that i'm going to put in today's date this is how it's gonna look you put in today's date hit search and then there we go um this is and also gives the reason and if you notice here you have this cool little reminder that um if it's been dispensed from please contact the patient immediately and i'm gonna show you a report of how to look up um that patient if that's the case okay um discarded items same thing if i had discarded an item today it'll show up here i'm just gonna you know what let's put this today's date it's gonna show everything for last year there we go so you can you can see what was started by a date range also have some selections so you can see what was expired recall transferred or you guys will be doing transfer but you know um stock reconcile you also have the ability for the inventory module to automatically remove expired product um so that way you won't accidentally dispense out of it um that's a setting that we can turn on for you if you're interested or you can come in yourself and discard all of your expired products um but it will show up here if that's the case okay so here we have our boxes that we uh just started earlier recalled we discarded one um i did this earlier with the client and filled out two bottles together so yeah this is all under your discarded items the next one is gonna be um inventory transactions this one is more like uh kind of investigative work um when you're looking up to see what happened with a certain product you can either just type in the product name or you can just put the date so let's see here actually no i forgot we need to actually put in our product here so go ahead and look at the box i'm gonna do today's date so today we obviously received in two bottles okay i did it manually decrease earlier of 10 um and if you need to see exactly what's going on with that barcodes like for instance the manual decreasing let's go here and look at that barcode number um i didn't recall obviously have one and then also doing our stock reconcile our or stock count i couldn't find two bottles so it's showing that these two were removed from inventory if any event dispense today would that a show on that screen too um yes if you so i can come back here um yeah anything to do with that bottle exactly it'll show on this um i think i did one earlier let's see when was that it's a tuesday here we go good issues so this is the one i did on on uh on the on the second um it shows you the invoice here so this is a good yeah an issue okay the invoice number the patient's account number or is it the invoice number that it created in the system yeah so whenever you dispense or measure out of out of main module um cure side um it sends it over it creates an invoice for your inventory module too so this only is applicable to your inventory module okay okay alright so also the last important section here on your reports tab is gonna be dispensed mets so this is gonna be very important especially if um if you uh um dispense a recall product to someone so you would just you you just different things you can look by you can look by the product itself you can put in the date um after you put in your search criteria hit search it'll bring up this is the one i did on the second um it'll bring up um you know that invoice number it'll bring up the patient the bar code the one that you recall if if that's the case um and then your number and everything so this is where you can come in and find patient information more directly especially if that product has been recalled you can search by the lot number here and if we can come in and contact that patience under expense maths okay does that make sense yes nice okay so again reports you can get in here and just play around see how you like it see how you can tell it to your your workflow but this is one section you can't mess up so you can definitely you know just play around all day with this and i'm gonna send you guys some pdf to go over everything that if uh if blake doesn't have them already i can send them to you guys and uh teamwork uh just kind of going over everything i've already shown you today you can go through those and also to you learn better hands on too so once you guys start playing around with it a lot of stuff that i showed you today will come back to mind alright so i'm gonna show you what it looks like let me dispense out of here curemd really quickly i'm gonna briefly go through it um blake will definitely go more in detail this isn't my forte over here but i will show you how it looks so i'm just gonna go ahead and bring up myself and i'm gonna go ahead and minister one of those marks selling to myself here so there we go so as you can see you know if you can search by medication but you have a custom bar code like black mentioned before i'm gonna show you how it looks when you scan it here so you hit the scan button here we have our marksicilon i'm gonna act like i'm scanning there we go so now it has and then just putting the necessary information just go ahead and put our again tablet they actually do one tablet every 12 hours for seven days so now it's gonna it's gonna do the calculation once it's over to um to the inventory module okay so we're at 14 tablets alright so and then your provider provider in after you put in everything that's important just hit prescribed yeah 14 tablets hit okay and then it will print your bring up your rx table there we go so there's your rx table you can give the package um we're gonna go ahead and jump back over to cure go ahead and refresh now so there's two ways you can bring an invoice you can go to your dispense and then um search invoice or you can just go here last invoices so there we go 949541 and uh let's see it's just the one yeah this is it let me just do one thing i want to make sure that that came over properly i think i did you may call a little error with our set up in our test account but here we go so invoice came over um the quantity i don't know i think i may there might be an error just with our test account somebody we do a lot of testing and just manipulation when you put it in under it that's weird i wonder why you have seven days in the 90s tablets oh you know what maybe i missed that yeah sorry about that okay i was wondering like what's going on yeah it said 14 but i may have not okay so yeah so that was my bad sorry sorry about that but as you can see it so i gave them the whole 90 tablets in the uh on the uh in the inventory module yeah i didn't catch that um but normally yeah it should i kind of want to show you how it looks can do another one if if you guys want but it should have shown on the 14 tablets let's just do one more so let me go ahead and bring up another um like expense that one let's go ahead and do this one let's do this barcode good and scan this one yeah okay yeah so we're gonna do the 14 tablets again there we go this is important thing right here sorry i don't come in too often to do this so yeah little rusty sorry about that so there we go instructions there um and then our our provider so let's go ahead and prescribe this i can show you how it looks over there oh there we go okay there we go sorry about that so now we have a 14 units today dispense for the patient so this is how we look um pretty much it for how it looks when you dispense and again voice numbers just for tracking reasons inventory and that is pretty much it um so again um the three everyone over his data receiving and reports um did you guys have any questions or anything you want me to show you go back over i don't think so i think it's just a matter of you know playing around with it for a little bit exactly alright i want to bring up your account really quickly here actually let me see if i can actually do it here perfect okay sorry i'm on my other screen give me a second here 13 93 so let me so this is your account union county health department i'm gonna hit search and this is what you guys have set up so far in your database you have 102 products um so what you're gonna wanna do next um if nothing has changed here is get uh start with receiving your product in um once you guys get your numbers in then you'll be able to start dispensing administer again i'm pretty sure blake i'm not sure when you're um like have they gone live yet or i start like what is there live date blakes probably multitasking here we've not gone live okay do you know when your goal is or do you have an idea uh no okay no worries no worries okay no worries that's more more common answer than none so yeah okay so no worries so when you guys get a chance you definitely um um wanna go through you know if nothing's changed as far as your your your products or anything go through and start receiving the numbers in eventually um what you'll be hearing to receive tab and then you're pretty much straightforward and ready to go your accounts pretty much ready as far as on the inventory side um but that's pretty much it um unless you guys have any questions that's that's all i have for you today as far as getting you guys acclimated into your inventory module good i think the fun part is we've seen all the products yeah it's gonna be fun that's always the tedious yeah it's serious but yeah definitely want to get that done then you're pretty much downhill from there but yeah that's gonna be fun and uh obviously you're gonna have partially spent stuff so you have the ability to modify it here under units okay so if you have like a bottle that normally comes in a bottle of 100 tablets you can modify only 80s in there um yeah that's pretty much it that's cool blake are you there another um clients have gone live as far as training the staff members on the floor and how to use the barcodes and how to use the system on the front end is that usually handle by the like would we do that training ourselves or is that something we should set up and have a training officially with curemd okay i can do you want me to answer that yeah no go ahead i wasn't sure she was just mentioning just here in particular or i'm sorry now i was gonna say so basically uh was that elaine okay elaine so the first step of the training is the one that you just had with word and the second step is that uh you know we just cover up some of the work flows within curemd and those workflows are actually very easy we just show you where to scan the barcode and you know and when and if you don't mind if i just take control of your screen i'll just quickly walk through uh the things that i need to cover uh let me request controls of you please oh i was gonna ask you to share keep sharing your screen and uh yeah i will request controls from you thank you sir um the mass control did you want to yeah sorry go ahead okay go ahead and do you want to bring up the cure please sir okay okay so one of the reasons why i extended the meeting uh and i'm only gonna take 10 minutes was just to show you the work flows that you know uh we need to train you on is not a very big thing so that's what i thought we'll just combine the training so you because it's hard to get people you know uh ready for i mean on the same call so one of the first things that you need to keep in mind is that when you're adding uh any product within uh inventory that ndc is available within cure as well so uh the main reason behind that is if that ndc is not available in cure and you add that product within the inventory is when you scan the barcode is you're not gonna be able to get that to work for example if i pick up this n d c and if i sense that ndc within cure if i get that product listed here it it means it's gonna work if that ndc is not available in cure that means it's not gonna work the second thing is that with the uh n dc we can cure use the unit of use and the c instead of unit of sale so you need to keep this in mind as well so this ndc here brought two products so you have to just make sure that ndc is searchable within cure if that ndc is not searchable within cure you enter a ticket with us stating that you know you've got a new product and the unit of use ndc is such as this and this and this and uh we're not able to find that product within cure please help us add that ndc within cure so what we'll do is we'll contact our third party that manages the cure medication library and then they will get that ndc added for us and then you'll be able to use it from there so this is the ndc thing the second thing is that when you are adding you know uh the product within for example if i pick uh if i had to pick an example i'll just say uh there was a birth control method very common one i forgot the name of it i haven't talked about it sorry just suggest at yeah why the i mean let me think um uh and then hit enter y az why why so for example if you are going to use this product within the inventory and you don't want to do much of the work when you are uh dispensing this med we just suggest that you add a custom sick for this so i mean you'll know that how many you know of these uh medicine will be dispensed to the patient at the time so you said you know whether it's gonna be windows and it's gonna be a calculate or a bottle whichever and then frequency you know how do you want the frequency to be so that way when you said these defaults for the sick and you're you know dispensing that medication you don't have to write the sick every time you just you know pick up from the sick which is already there so that kind of saves time when you know dispensing medication so this is that so this was the you know part for the uh medication thing the vaccine thing is almost the same for the vaccine you just have to ensure that ndc again is available within cure and the second thing is just like the uh medication you can set the default for the vaccine as well for example if i pick up this one here this i believe is there you go this is seneca so you can select the default for example the dosage whether the route is gonna be which one for example is the intramuscular site could be a left deltoid instead of a left arm so when you are administering this vaccine you are uh not gonna make those selections on the front end you just click scan the barcode and it's already pre selected you just hit you know safe so that brings me to my second question are you gonna be administering uh vaccines through the inventory module as well or no yeah eventually okay okay great so yeah this is uh this is exactly where you need to come so for example the here uh when you see this one i'll pick up a more appropriate one so let's say if i pick up moderna so the moderna one where to go there it is so the the moderna one basically is you know if you see this ndc here this is the unit of views ndc the unit of sale ndc that you see on the madonna boxes slightly different i think it's a 900909 i can't remember exactly so that ndc is not gonna be searchable within cure so you have to associate the product with the unit of use and to see when you're adding that product within the inventory module okay any questions on this one so so for example yeah has comes in a box with three packages i would use not the ndc that's on the box but the ndc that's on the package that is correct on the package yes okay okay and with the um signature is added to the settings if you have a kind of a blanket signature added and then on the front end they end up getting something slightly different when the automatic one pulls up in their screen do they have the option to edit it and change it if needed if they happen to be giving something different than what was usual could you explain that to me a little bit what the signature thing that you put in that i'm gonna send um a bottle of 100 pills and tell them to take one a day and that's the signature that put it in the settings and then i go to um admit dispense that to a patient pulls up i'm gonna tell him to take two a day and that automatic one a day up on my screen drive the option to change it yes yes yes automatic i mean you you can create custom six as many as you like so they will be you could add the 11 tablet a day or two tablets a day you'll have the option to choose the different sects there'll be all listed when you choose that product thank you and the custom one comes up in my screen once it's all right there can i on the front end edit and alter that yes yes you can add it from the front end as well yep you can do that okay yeah you can certainly do that through there okay so now i'm gonna come back to your question earlier that when do you guys think that to go live and everything so first thing first uh when all of the products already uh already added within cure i mean within the inventory module yeah that well as far as the the data record yeah that's what i was showing earlier to them yes all the products are here um so this is your account the union union county so i mean nothing's changed here nothing needs to be updated then they can go ahead and start receiving the inventory awesome so i mean i think you can start off with by adding the you know by uh receiving the inventory within the inventory module start creating the barcodes and everything once you've done that one and have you walked through the the step of you know uh what's the word i'm trying to find um you know to verify the barcode and everything i mean the stock count yeah um yeah we went through all as far as yeah exactly printing barcodes everything uh elaine once you have added all the products you know uh stock within the inventory you just do a stock count and then you know uh you just make sure all the products are there the stock count is ready and then you know you just pick a day when you want to go live and then we go from there so we will be on you know support for you guys for the go live date to make sure everything runs smoothly and then that should be it and we can add a test product if you want to use for testing that was probably a good idea so we can see how it works on the front end and make sure we're planning to people that uh what do you mind adding a test product i will give you one ndc from union county which uh which text test product uh would you like to use i mean would you like to use a uh birth control method or would you like to use a i mean i mean it's gonna be named as test product within the inventory module i just wanna know what from the curemd side it could be uh from my saying it could be uh you know aspirin it could be anything yeah this or not let's let's let's let's pick up aspirin for now let's do the vitamin sorry which one your vitamin could you spell the first word for me please so i can search it within the union counties database p as in paul r me n a t a l bear with me one second do you mind trying searching on your side as well just in case if i miss it on the curemd side okay so you can go ahead i'll let you no i'm searching in their actual db you you want me to search to make sure that the inventory module already no no within within the test db that you're in we just want to get the ndc to be there prenatal one daily alright let's go to the medication template yeah medication time within cure yep just searching here i'm searching for one here as well uh blake yes sir prenatal one daily i'm trying um yeah let's see there's there's a lot on my side and there's the letter oh i just typed the wrong name give me 1 second should we just pick up any one of these yeah okay let's just pick up by this oh this does not have an ndc it's gonna have an ndc oh there's another thing if you have a product that do not have an ndc code we're gonna have to associate a product code with this one and then you'll be able to use that will cover that in later sessions with you and me only but for now i'll just pick up the aspirin as a test for now because i don't want to overwhelm that information for now if that's okay is that okay with you guys as long as it's something that would end up sitting on the label that we would be putting on a bottle we wanna see on the front end if someone was just something a bottle of medication location what the process would look like look like when it yes so when uh i've already copied the ndc on your uh system so if you go ahead and add that in the inventory please with ndc in union counties uh account i think you can move the one what's it doesn't matter as far as just yeah i'll just uh unit container i'll just use you know whichever uh and container you could do a bottle instead of a box yeah they are and uh billing code just at um i don't know do you want to associate a billing code with this just test for the super bill um it it doesn't matter okay then don't add because it's gonna affect the reporting so just go with it without the super bill and just save it please and just put them uh and uh just print out a few barcodes and then that they can use later maybe just two bar codes for now we'll do alright i'll say just yeah two is fine and if you can just um uh when and if you can attach those barcode numbers or the bar code itself document to the uh pdf to the uh team work you can you know pick up the barcode number from there alright awesome alright guys thank you one once we put in the numbers of inventory we pretty much need staff already be live so that anything that gets dispence from that point forward is being scanned and because if we were just to load all the inventory today and then go live next wednesday things are gonna be dispensed between now and then in inventory correct yes i mean you're gonna have to add add all of those you know products within the inventory i mean the products are added but you're gonna have to do a little stock count to make sure all your stocks are added within the inventory module and then you can you know print the barcodes and go from there right so once we add inventory and have the account correct we can't have staff just doing dispensing the old way without doing it through the system they need to be in the system otherwise their inventory is gonna be wrong uh the staff basically once you have added all these products within inventory and you scan the barcodes and i mean you created the barcodes and everything uh it is basically ready the staff is you know uh not gonna be able to dispense any medication unless or until you give them the barcode numbers if that makes sense did i answer your question because what we were thinking that we were gonna have to because like with family planning on the day that like monday when they are working their inventory so that come tuesday may come in dispensing taking it out of inventory working so they may be at that point maybe the only ones that are utilizing and then do the same thing that is correct so basically what you will do is train all the staff at the barcode that vernon has generated next thing will be to do the stock count for and i think that's a good plan that you take one clinic at a time for example start with the family planning uh get all of their products added and then next one could be and you know another clinic and then uh with all of the products added you know step by step and uh once the family planning products there you just get the bar codes uh printed give it to the staff and then you know just go from there okay coming saturday and doing the only other way was that a question for me no no we're just talking to ourselves i think we're good okay alright alright so if there's anything else uh elaine you can always uh you know update the product uh just put a comment in there and if there's any questions with you know with the with an inventory or just put a comment in there and born and and i myself uh we'll get back to you on that alright okay thank you everyone joining uh thank you vernon again for your patience and time and uh we'll we'll talk soon then um no problem thanks i just have one more question so should i enable the barcode scanning on the immunization for now or should i just leave it until you give us the go ahead because for the medical for the medication it is currently enabled for everyone but the immunization is not so just let me know whenever you want to enable for the immunization module now now the immunization module with insurance we don't utilize yet at all okay okay that's fine then kind of holding up for the npr okay okay yeah that is fine then we'll keep that disabled under the immunization is only available for the prescription pad and everything else i mean the medication side alright that makes it easy for me okay um well i guess that's uh that's pretty much it for now and uh i hope you all have a great weekend you too thank you dear thank you bye so those labels are they gonna be on printed on sticky we're using the legal center"}}, {"id": 424, "data": {"call_id": "1622641405.124048.txt", "text": "thank you for calling the santa county health department paris spaniel hello this is katherine hi katherine this is phil calling from curemd can i please speak with warne this is katherine warne oh um but how are you i am doing good thank you i am calling in regards to your ticket that you have some payment through apple pay and which appeared as the credit card payment but on the receipt it is showing up as uh but on the report is showing up as cash payment right can you please do a screen share session i want to see that because i am actually unable to find the credit card payment because actually what now i am actually unable to find the credit card payment so can you do a screen share session so that you can show me yeah so i just need to bring up patients let me get this for you i am sorry let me bring up the patient for you just a second 37279 okay i have the patient up okay can we do a screen share session through anydesk yes how do i do that uh you can go to google write down anydesk and you will see a download option okay hold on one second i thought i had let me see if that is anydesk i thought maybe i had to put that on my i might not let me go to google any desk without space alright so then i do then do i just click on anydesk remote desktop click on that do you see a free download option a what free download uh okay download now for free team view remote access yes you will see a 9-digit code you need to tell me that code okay hold on one second let me see alright that is not that is not anydesk that is not being the right thing here let me go back sorry no problem okay where am i seeing the code at oh it says download in a green box click on that yes okay ah get started with the three steps download now okay it says here um i had a window pop up it says microsoft defender smart screen prevented and unrecognized from starting running this that might put your pc well can you tell me how uh what is the icon of anydesk how does it look like is it red i do not have an icon yet because i did not let me see um what i can do is like i can open up your practice on my end as well and you can tell me the steps to follow maybe that can help let me go to another one here let me click on i l i d s okay so when i click on download it um comes up saying thank you for downloading anydesk and then it says um by downloading anydask you accept the license agreement privacy statement please consider taking a survey then it says if the download does not start automatically please click the link below so okay all right i have done that but i did not let me go to my desktop it is up there okay it is not what did you tell me to do how how could you help me did you say what we can do is you can open up your practice application on your end and i will open on my end as well you can tell me the steps which i will follow and that is how i will see that what is happening okay so what do you mean to open up my practice like you can open up the application on on your end the anydesk no no no curemd okay okay okay okay i have got a curemd open okay now i am in the patients account uh patients name is wilson uh jacoby i guess so where should i go now okay so now we will go under billing go to charges and we are gonna go on yesterdays date which is you see the charges listed 161 which is already paid general uh huh okay i am in it okay then you are gonna click on payment at the top the tabs that stop payment on the payment okay and then you are gonna go down to where it says 8658 click on the plus sign the green plus sign and it says 23 dollars she paid $23 okay i can see that okay okay so um that is where it is what i did was um then we have to go into converged another software system to actually run the card but when i was in curemd entered it as an advance payment on the advanced payment screen and did you put in card details bye um because if you did not put the card details the system will recognize this amount as a cash payment okay all right i put it she gave me she gave me a credit card the first time and what it was it was a benefits card healthcare saving like a health benefits card i put in all that information and it does not you know would not accept well the converge system would not accept it because it was a healthcare savings plans we do not take we do not accept those so then when i went back into curemd uh they gave me the apple his apple his phone with the apple pay and then the converge i tapped it on my little reader here and it went through but i did not do anything different in the m i am sorry you did not do what in the curemd i did not put in any kind of information off the off the phone in curemd now the thing is that if no information is entered into the curemd application then the amount will be considered as a cash what we can do is there is a way that we can change it okay if you if you click on like i can you asked me to click on the plus sign right beside the c p t right right okay now on the line level in which it is appearing that you have collected $23 at the end of that line you will see the added option right we are going to edit okay so you see that you use if if you see that you selected uh the payment method method as credit card but you actually allocated the amount from the advances so the credit card option is not in voided because you did not take any payment from the credit card you applied the balance from the unemployed section okay okay so because it was in the advances it is appearing as cash okay all right so that is the reason other than that if you manually post the payment and you select payment method is credit card it will appear as credit card but when you will post the payment through advances if you did not take the advances through card it will appear as cash okay okay alright so how can we get that fixed now um in order to get this fixed let me check a few things okay alright just give me a moment i am checking okay i got it um on the left hand side do you see under the billing the last option is patient advances yes okay if you go there and uh you can see that you have collected like um uh right so if you go at the end of that line you will see two boxes click on the first box okay you will see a payment receipt right and the method is bearing as cash so when you edit the advance you selected it as cash we cannot change it okay alright that is why it is appearing as cash i got you i got you okay alright so and my my receipt that i gave that i printed from here curemd it showed a credit card but i am a report it showed up as cash but let me check that receipt as well okay okay uh you print the receipt from the payment section uh no i am sorry i did not not from payment section i printed the receipt from the advanced payment so what i am thinking now that you have explained it to me this way the first card that she gave me which was her health benefits card yeah um i printed that receipt okay curemd took it but the converge did not so when i went in there to try to avoid avoid it out i still had the receipt from her first credit card saying $23 in advance section makes makes sense yeah so when she gave me the apple i pay i did not go in there and change that that is okay okay alright i am on the page where you are now no problem okay so there is no way of saying that now though no because the log is generated and um like if if you would have like took the payment while you were posting it if you would have selected the payment method then it will be it will appear it would have appeared as the credit card payment but then then you applied it from the advances so it is a whole different scenario right right okay okay well i made a note on my report yesterday you know i i documented all that so i guess i should be okay with that but if there is no way of fixing it here in curemd no no way to fix my report um we cannot change it like manually okay okay alright then alright well thank you for calling me and that to me is there anything else i can help with no that is it thank you so much for your time alright bye bye bye bye bye bye"}}, {"id": 425, "data": {"call_id": "1622824438.1305285.txt", "text": "hi hello oh hey evan how's it going good good good uh simmon do you have a minute or two yes let me just log in okay so can i get in touch uh got in touch with the technical team again so as far as uh immunizations are concerned we are clear on that that it is working ccd uh file organizations uh the only issue was with the allergies right so um once you select any allergy uh you are able to see uh if you are able to see the red color means those are uncoded right but the main concern was uh that uh if the the norm court is our nail how are we able to locate that uh those are uh you know uh which ones will show on on the ccd file and which ones will not be there so uh what i learned from the technical team they told me that i need to log a bug related to this uh particular problem so what i can do is i i'm going to log the bug right now but our uh as you must know our uh technical team works uh according to off hours so i will have an update on this by monday would that be okay if i can get in touch with you on monday and give you an update yeah that's fine but so is there any way to make uh the uncoded to coded um actually uh i did discuss that with them um if you add any certain um you know allergy and you need to make it uh coded because if you add a new allergy it will be uncoded right so you will have to forward that request to us and we will give it to the uh technical team and they add the code from the back end uh because uh they need to find out what codes are attached with those particular allergies and they do it uh from the back end it cannot be done from the front end you can always add it you can always uh you know added to the patient's profile but there will be a problem when you uh you know uh export it as a ccd got it got it okay okay that's fine then alright so what i'm going to do is

me what exactly is happening what the error message you reported a couple of problems uh in that ticket so if you can show me um exactly you're not able to use ah i'm froze a lot of that is happening yeah i mean i'm not able to see anything right now you're not seeing anything yeah are are you logging into cure md i c a lot i see the any desk page right now uh huh i see you are on the any desk yeah and i'm trying to log back into okay all right i can see you're not a lot where it's not responding to cure md that gets that a lot oh that message okay is that the problem pardon me is that the problem that you uh reported or or is there any other thing that you would like to use the error messages that i get i think that that photo that i received that day every time i try to put something in it would give me that message and then can you please show me that well i don't do it now because i did it today and then it doesn't show the message but then right but when you called i was getting ready to upload a picture in and then the message came then at that time so it's a hit or miss each time okay let me let me see the workflow that how you're uploading the image i see the message that's a new 1 mhm different through a lot of word can i check something real quick before i ask you to proceed because i think i know what exactly is happening let me quickly check something one moment please oh gosh that's why just a moment andre are you available now okay alright so andre i was checking uh your computer uh in terms of the performance as well as um in terms of how good internet service that you're getting so i don't see any problems uh on your internet side you have comcast uh which is providing you good speed right now the connection is stable as well so whatever you're facing in cure md is not because of the internet but i do see uh something alarming on on the screen over here as i can share that with you as well that you are using windows 10 but you have only three gb of memory if you go on google and search for recommended memory for microsoft windows 10 it would say eight gigabytes so you have even less than 50% of what you have available right now so what's happening is that whatever you are using any website or using cure md application and you go to different like pages within the application your memory gets utilized like very quickly it goes up to 80% sometimes around 90% and the moment it goes beyond 85% it starts stopping some of the other processes in the background so that it makes the memory available for the process that you're currently doing so it's a bargain between um different processes on on terms of memory that you do not have sufficient memory available on this computer to even use windows 10 sufficiently and you'll have to compromise between different you know areas of your computer uh to free of the memory for other processes so that is exactly why your application is working flow i believe you will see slowness overall in your whole computer in different areas that if you try to open something if you try to go to any website um it's taking more than usual time to load that up and it's happening because there isn't any memory available for the computer to display that information on your screen and that's why it takes time to free up the memory first and then displays the information and what that does is that it gives you the information that you were asking for but the moment you go back to your uh previous work the memory for that work has already been you know um dedicated to the new process so that process you know stops working provides you with different errors on the screen and sometimes you'll have to load up the page again and again so it is just happening because of having very low memory on this computer right now okay i do see you have four slots available on this computer where you can install uh two more memory sticks uh to take this number up to 8gb i mean i'm not sure if you're um if you can physically like open up your uh computer case and look for the memory sticks but anyone technical uh enough to um you know uh handle the computers and stuff they can easily understand what installing uh a new memory stick meets uh the best way would be to like switch the computer if you have any spirit available uh with a good memory on it i would prefer using that uh otherwise uh you'll have to extend the memory on this computer uh because it's running on low memory over here it's an old computer as i can see its code to deal um the cps were developed if i'm not wrong um probably around 2000 um 57 or maybe before 2000 but it's definitely before 2000 and 10 so we're talking about like um around 12 to 15 years old uh processor or a computer right now yes so i mean this is how uh the situation is on your side on your computer if your colleagues have um you know a better computer i'm certain that they're not having such problems that you are facing right now on your system okay so yeah i i believe it's it's just happening because of the computer problem here um if there are any certain error messages that are happening not just for you but for your other uh practice members as well then it's something that can definitely be a problem at the side and we are available to take care of that problem for you guys but i don't see anything right now uh on the side which is stopping you from completing your job okay is there anything that you would like to uh like share over here if there is any errors that you're getting because the moment you reported that ticket um you stated that um there was some error messages that you were getting in currently so um i wanted to uh i had to take a picture and upload it on there it says like server error in m d y application object reference not set in stance of an object okay and description on handle yeah i do see the screenshot here attached on the screen is this something that you can reproduce again because we recently uh did some maintenance activities to you know rectify the uh problems at the back end because it has been like three or four days now since um you reported the matter so i'm wondering if the problem is still occurring on your side is is it possible if you can try reproducing that so that i can then take it to my technical team and get that fixed for you well i'm not sure because um this is when i was putting in the other day so today i came in and and then everything is fine okay right before what you called i was trying to upload the picture in and then i got that same message not the one that you saw can we try again read this way for alright let me try i have to go through some pictures to put it back in no well i didn't show that one yeah can you can you try like closing this provider note and opening up again to save it and get back to the provider note one more time okay let's try now so would you suggest that when it happens to the ticket in and leave it up uh well um whenever you log a ticket a person gets assigned to that particular problem and that person contact you so that they can try reproducing the problem and grab the information to share with the technical team and have that resolved so i'm exactly doing the same thing over here that i need to collect the data on the problem so that i can share that with my technical team to help them to check the problem at the back end and get that resolved for you if you if you find that picture um just allow me to take controls is that the picture okay let me let me check what does it say the same picture or it's different picture okay let me try copy this picture on the next stop so that i can see if there is nothing wrong with the picture itself okay so it's loading up the picture so that's okay let me just rename it alright one moment let me now check the settings okay so i'm still getting this message let me try reproducing it on my end hold on just a minute as well thank you okay alright i'm gonna lock you out from here okay so i'm opening a google chrome browser now let's see if it works over there i tried it on my end and it worked so i'm wondering if microsoft edge is causing that problem but the funny thing is um earlier i was able to put like four pictures into another patient's chart is like it's sometimes sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't okay can you try this time now please please go to the same patient's chart there's a file with the name i oh okay so it's doing the same thing over here as well okay let me check something now one moment i'm gonna log you out from chrome as well because it's not happening because of the browser you can use you can use the same browser microsoft again let me let me now check one more thing one moment can you click on this prompt uh can you click on this not selected drop down click on 30 minutes uh-huh impress yes okay great mhm alright let's try again um just go under marcus of edge and try logging into kurandi and go ahead and upload let's see if it works i believe it's the n t r status locking guarantee you believe it it's the antivirus on your system yes i had to white list during the website most probably was blocking it that's why you were getting that cloud message that it's resetting the connection or it's blocking it let's see if it helps can i am to you over here still blocking it oh gosh okay let me try this if i pause it for a moment let's see if it resolves the problem okay can we let me change it to like 30 minutes for now click on oh it's working on it oh okay let's see um okay i'm gonna log you out and let me check one thing over here okay great open it again alright please log in looks like it's floating a bit faster this time can you can you go under the same patient everything is loading quite fast now so that's slowing it down too oh it's doing the same thing let me try this other patient did i checked for test test let me try this picture i need to check the properties over here the other picture was quite heavy ah okay this one is okay let's try this here we go so it accepted that let's try another picture i mean the same one that we that we were doing before the i m g let's see if it accepts that okay no that's what is happening it's not it's not like antivirus it's not anything it's the picture it's uh um that picture is off four um gigabytes i mean four megabytes let me see over here we have it over here let me edit and try reducing its resolution what was the cheap okay i created a copy of it now it is over here let's see what's its size it's less than four this one is 45117 this one is 3.15 let's see if trendy except this one the one with you one yep so it is accepting it so the problem is most likely with the picture let me check if we can use the same one has the read only attribute i'm going to uncheck this because this one doesn't have that yeah this one didn't have let me check this one again okay great let's try uploading the same previous one the old one mm yeah let's yeah the first one yep let's let's do that again img this one no is the picture of self mm yeah well um the picture is i believe is bigger in size it's around 4.17 the one we created is 3.15 so you can use this one to upload into the provider note so um i mean this is where the root cause lies that it's good to have uh the pictures with a bit lower size or with a bit lower resolution you can try adjusting your camera settings to take a medium sized pictures like with medium resolution so that the size of the pictures is low and you do not face any problems uploading them that's why you were you were right that some of the pictures um did go through but it didn't allow you to upload certain pictures so can you try uploading that picture into that provide a note and and see if it works the one that we created for you if there are any other pictures i can do that um for those pictures as well for your convenience for now yeah i mean the quality is exactly the same but you see the size is lower so if you try adjusting the camera settings on your phone i believe you took it from your iphone so if you if you reduce the uh camera picture settings in there uh hopefully that will you know fix the problem for you and see i just uploaded several pictures there was no issues and i'm like what's going on now very strange i mean myself um cannot certainly say that if it's gonna work or not but um we now know for sure that it's it is happening because of the picture itself it's not with every picture but uh with certain pictures and um i can certainly say that the problem is not with them d alright well thank you okay no problem well i appreciate your time and help as well and may i close this case from our side now um do you have any other concerns to report now okay no problem in case if you have any just log in new ticket or give us a call and one last thing that um the slowest problem that you were putting where you were getting the message that the pages unresponsive it happens because of the memory so whenever you see that happening just close the whole marcus of edge browser from here like right click and close all the windows and then reopen a devil free of the memory and you may you may continue using it um so that you do not get those areas again okay alright alright i appreciate you all right thanks for your time as well have a good day bye you too"}}, {"id": 431, "data": {"call_id": "1622567206.1209824.txt", "text": "documents office hey uh angelica this is ryan

problem may i have your first name please okay it's jay j a y and jay what practice are you calling in from cardinal rehab services do you allow me one quick moment here okay alright jay could you please tell me what report are you trying to run okay um so i basically i wanna see all the patients that were not seen in april um i mean i realize there's a few different ways we could do that uh by looking at the appointment date or uh maybe looking at all the like a report on all the notes that were done but basically i need to see every patient that we didn't get to see in april so i can um go into their chart in the month of april alright yes mhm now um i'll just let you know i have called before about this i believe but i don't know that it really worked that it just looks strange because i'm comparing um your system or this report to our system that we're integrating with y'all it's called care link it's a uh scheduling software and um but i i recently uh just yesterday i went through the whole month comparing the schedule on curemd to care link schedule and i matched it up so every patient that was seen on um curemd is now reflecting in our other program um so now i'm just going in and comparing the um the date of what this report is that i ran which i call if you go to search criteria under hot list or under patient and then search it's one of those custom searches and so i created the report and let's see it could you show me your screen as well jay yeah i have any desk here i have this number ready i'm ready ok 387163277 okay alright so it's right here so that oh you got it okay um so here we have follow up one um and then we have last visit and then all selected for status and so that report that i ran is right here and see so patient uh here we go last visit date so i had to rename it because y'all don't use the latest format or whatever um and so i sorted it by ascending or descending here under data um so here we have so bailey william and then if i bring over this other in here so we can go into the i'm just showing you the patient um so if we go to the schedule and we go to april sorry hold on no problem okay so if we go to april uh this is weird let's go to so this is when i realized there was a problem so i clicked here so this is allegedly the last visit date adrian jordan 4 6 so here april 6th there is no one here now if we go to cure m d go to the schedule there is no one on here so why would it say that that was the last visit date um and i don't let me just double check is it maybe this other practitioner no it's not that either so why would the last visit date of this report say that it says uh sixth of april and in cure m d what's the date in cure md well uh so if we go on 4 6 there's no one so uh and if we go to pull the patient let's let's go see when they did have an appointment okay oh okay 4 6 oh okay but why would it not because under a different provider oh okay that's confusing hmm well then why aren't um that's weird okay in fact you are i mean the report that you're running you're running through the patient's tab so uh had it been through a provider then it might have been in a different way right you know what i'm saying mhm so even if they change status appointment or even if it's a with whatever provider it's gonna give the last date okay um so i'd have to select the provider then now um gosh okay i guess i just select paulina"}}, {"id": 435, "data": {"call_id": "1622661087.1254199.txt", "text": "thank you for calling independence pediatrics if this is a medical emergency please

about the prescriptions uh this is doctor doqo from the manhattan center for headache and neurology my my question is um so you know how when when you're starting to prescribe a medicine um uh this you can you click on the directions and then all the saved directions show up um that anyone i guess has saved in the system and what i want to know is is there a way to edit it because sometimes these instructions are wrong or incomplete and there's it's just it messes everything up because there's so many in there that aren't right uh well well doctor if if we could get on a screen share session uh it would make things easy for me to understand and then guide you on this okay sure okay so go ahead uh do you have anydesk application on your computer um yeah okay so i'm doing it right now sure okay okay the number is 900 221 839 839 you said yes okay just give me one moment okay i can see your screen now mhm okay so i'll show you so if i check a test patient um okay so say i go into medications and i prescribe something okay uh say i so i go like that and then do you see how these these these uh these directions pop up like this they want you to choose something um but like this one i wanted to say repeat after you know what maybe maybe i'll look at this one see what this one says okay say i want to change this to repeat after four hours so i want to delete this because this is not right um how do i do that is that even possible um okay well if you hit this custom thing yeah you could change it yeah that i know i know okay so you're thinking you want that to be in the drop down i i do not want that to be in the drop down because it's wrong it shouldn't be repeat after two hours should be repeat after four and repeat after four hours is in that drop down menu but you know if you look here it is in that drop well so i guess it's not doing it again it won't do it again because let me see here yeah here see all these this is wrong it should say after four so we should i i is there a way to prevent it from coming up because it's so easy to accidentally click on it you know this one is correct because it's after four hours so right im asking is there another way or is that once it's done that's done let me let me just quickly check it on the back end if if there's a way that we could take it off just give me one quick moment doctor i'm gonna put you on a brief hold thank you sure crowded room you find something lie hello and you thank you for holding doctor you there yes okay could you could you please type in that medication here oh right there okay okay this is the one the second one yeah okay so the top one the first one is the one that things incorrect okay so you could check it from here and then you can delete it from this button okay how did you get there i'll show you that the settings tab okay once you hit the settings tab you go in ehr right down here it's medications okay under data template medication and then you try to you search it okay yeah that makes it good because we want to correct our mistakes because we are vulnerable to okay sure no problem just one quick question doctor have you logged a ticket on this question no no i just called up okay if you allow me i can quickly report this okay are we supposed to be doing that every single time well reporting uh i mean the best way you could actually do this is logging a ticket in the beginning at the first place and then the right department okay so you go up to support right next to my name log a ticket yes and all your tickets okay well all those tickets that you have uh logged in the past would show in my tickets and the status would be there as well oh i see okay alright no one told us that or if they did i wasn't aware well that's the the the the benefit out of that is that the right department would get back to you so that saves you time got it okay instructions i guess you could say so you you once you log in a ticket in the future you could just choose personal from here and if it's a question you could put it as a question if it's a bug or something something misbehaving you could put it as a bag and then the priority level then check your you have the right email here the right contact number and the best time that you could be called back at once that happens you submit this and you get a ticket number now this is where it's gonna be tracked as well and it is done on priority as well when it's uh once you have a ticket logged for for any of such things okay alright doctor anything else i can help you with no

"my family doctor good afternoon hi this is collin from curemd could i please speak to amnasia hold on a moment please my family doctor hi this is collin from curemd am i speaking with amnasia i am basically calling in regards of your support ticket where you wanted to know how to email the provider notes yes alright do you still need to know or you figure that out on yourself no i don't need to know all right can we do a quick remote session so that i can show you the workflow how to email them sure uh give me one second no problem it would be anydesk yeah okay anydesk okay i'm downloading it no problem alright uh it says enter remote desk id mm no the other one your desk can be accessed with this address there should be an nine digit code numeric that you need to provide me uh 518251 232 alright i'm sending you request please accept that thank you it's not letting me it's asking me for an administrator password and i don't have that no problem in that case give me one moment let me just open up the practice on my end i think i am able to see your screen can you please open the practice yeah i am able to you can allow yeah yeah alright you can just cancel this okay this allow access alright can you please open any provider note that you wanna send sure uh these are this is an example of some provider notes can you open any alright so if you come here uh send email and then it will ask you what information do you wanna you know add it to it after confirming the uh information you'll hit okay and it will come up like this so you'll enter the email address here this subject and the text whatever you want and then you can hit send and that er provider note will be sent to the relevant person to whom you would be sending okay i probably asked the question incorrectly i know how to do that i wanted to send for example more than one provider note like if i'm sending over medical records to someone and i also wanted to attach our provider note can i do that once you select the provider note just like before and once you had sent an email it it gives you all the relevant documents down there you see them yeah but these documents for example that we've uploaded i want i mean like more than one provider note at the same time uh no i'm afraid that would not be possible you can just send one provider note at a time so for example i have um doctor's office is asking me for the last three provider notes of 2019 i have to send the provider note one by one oh you can generate a report for those provider note and send that let me confirm you how to do that so if you come here provider note you'll enter the search criteria for the dates the provider and it will show you the report you can you know extract that report and send that this is an example where you can send multiple provider notes okay okay uh let me see uh you need to select the start and the end date as well for the time that you want and the last name is not complete so probably that's one of the reasons why it's not populating okay mhm the last name for this patient is not complete so so the name is a bit yes otherwise you can give the account number for that patient just in case if you're not sure about the spelling so you can enter the account number or the date of birth as well that's quite search okay so you can select the provider notes that you want and you know just selected that's correct and then you can export this report by hitting save uh i believe this is the option email it also yes yes yeah yes you can do that okay hold on let me just write this down because sure i haven't done it too often i just wanna make sure i've got this down correct so i would go to report and after i go to report january progress provider notes patient and i just select the type okay that's correct okay you you can enter either their date of birth or their account number uh instead of you know putting their first name and last name whatever you feel comfortable okay alright okay thank you alright no no no i'll close support ticket on my end thank you so very much for the confirmation i'm going to close this any desk session from my side alright okay okay thank you bye you're welcome bye bye"}}, {"id": 451, "data": {"call_id": "1622648084.1245992.txt", "text": "hi this is collin from cure md could i please speak to doctor kang he's not in

issue you are facing right now so i can help you out um i just sent i just entered a new insurance but when i submitted the claim i checked later that um it does not have the correct information on the platform no problem we'll fix that for you do you have any desk can we share screen yeah and i would like to stop that one as soon as possible it doesn't go out i know i just submitted it and it's sitting in my submitted but so can i stop before it really hits the insurance if it's in submitted bucket that means it's already being sent out to the insurance but i can actually have a look if it's an unsubmitted bucket so we can actually delete that file so in order to prevent of submitting the claims to the insurance uh can i have your number so we can share screen um sure submitted it doesn't hit the clearing house first so it might be at the clearing house right now right because i just sent let me actually um can we share screen first and then we'll see like what happened with the claim okay the number is 477 699 225 i'm sorry 699 and 225 235 yes 25 okay 25 okay got it sending a request please accept okay i can see your screen please take me to curemd okay perfect so it's your submitted bucket right now so okay in the submitted bucket the claims will be coming in if the claims are already sent out the insurance and unfortunately there's no way that we can actually stop um if uh if you already submit the claim so all you can do at this time you can simply call the insurance and uh you can start processing them on this claim and um once you have a proper conversation with them you can resubmit the claim with the correct details and can i ask you what incorrect information is in the insurance plan so we can actually check that out for you i this claim was denied for this patient for uh the incorrect jurisdiction so i entered the correct correct insurance for the b instead of the c jurisdiction and when i checked when i sent it right now to the b and i check in my claim um preview it doesn't have the right information it has the wrong um n p i here should be the group npi for our dmerc perfect in that case the um we need to actually create your billing group so you your billing group npi will be appearing on your hcfa box 33 b so can you actually zoom this page a little bit uh you just need to use your cursor on your mouse just press control on your keyboard and use your cursor to zoom in a little bit because i can't see it correctly a little bit more thank you so much now it's better okay let's go ahead and check your okay my bad please go through the same patient and let me open the uh sorry you practice on my end and it's for the galleria pain physician p l l c right okay just go to the patient please and open up the charge now let's see you have dmerc vision b okay uh let let me control your system now let's go to the profile on more time dmerc vison b and the edi number is already attached is it the right edi number your id great yeah let me quickly check your billing group so thats dmerc vision b got you yeah it's a good match exactly like the dmerc c that's right so let me actually add that for you give me one quick moment so the billing group wasn't created due to which your n p i was in um added correctly so we have dmerc c right over here search now let me actually create dmerc c as well dmerc b got you and all specialists alright and uh 6700 west loop south 2025 2 25 battery texas 774014104 perfect gotcha give me one moment let me attach the providers as well um you don't need to attach doctor tolosa right now doctor tolosa okay i'll remove him so the all of the providers are added with the dmerc vision b now let's go to the patient is it nancy yes please okay charges in your second appointment for 1 2021 go to the claim section professional let's preview this first and let's see okay yeah the correct npi is being uploaded on your um reports or anything else i can do for you um can you show me where can i find my providers p 10 numbers um i'll be attached to the group p 10 and stuff like if i need to check that group p 10 numbers are not added on the front end or the in the application group p 10 are actually used at the time of edi and era enrollment so that is something like we should be done on the portals and from our enrollment team but you will not be using p 10 numbers on in this application like in anywhere in the billing information so it is a different um like it happens like if you want a provider id number over here on the 24 j but that's completely different so number you won't be able to see in the application okay so yeah so the claims can go out without the correct that's right you can send a claim without the p 10 but if they're rejects due to any information they need them um like any provider id or the anything else so they will let you know right now uh since only the npa was the issue npi issue is fixed now now the under correct information you're sending the claim but you need to actually wait because you already uh submit the claim to the insurance um and let me show you in the payment section let's go to that's the 141 2021 and there you go so 56 2021 you have already submitted the claim i would actually request you to wait now because um on this claim this will be actually uh denied again because um you have already you you have sent a claim already so please call the insurance you can call the insurance you can let them know that you have submitted the claim for this patient for the merc and uh just have them stop working on this and after that like after confirming from the insurance you can try to submit the claim one more time okay okay thank you so much thank you so much for your time you have a great day take care

has data error and the loop non for one more submitting error batch functional group segment level due to unknown error contact for further details okay let me quickly look at the claim first can you minimize the screen or move it to any other screen just logo actually uh not i can't think shared i'm just looking at the rejections on my end bear with me hm thank you so much for staying on the line james so i found the issue actually the thing is you guys are submitting the group uh sorry the claims under your group npi and under this information like healthcare there was no group was created in

will be managed under your group details now i'm creating a group for all service united healthcare so you would uh you would have an idea about like you can submit the claims accordingly you can submit the claim under your original npi fine uh miss can you hear me sorry i said i see here that um the npis this 1194 is individual npi and that's right so this is what i'm talking about the npi needs to be 1073550919 so it's a group npi and 107 is a group npi yes and so the reason why the individual npis populating over here it's due to the missing billing group so this is why it wasn't appearing over there okay give me one moment let me for you okay okay are you there please just give me one moment i'm almost done mhm thank you so much for staying on the line so the group has been created you can simply mark this claim as corrected from your rejected bucket and you can submit this claim one more time and the other one sorry and the other one's like having like this one see here

josie this is john with Cure how are you hi john how are you i'm doing great thanks did you have time do you want me to show you the referring uh specialities where they're coming from or what is it what is it that we're doing remember the referring uh specialities there are a bunch of them like multiple set of one were you able to minimize them we cannot because their uh one actually has so there's basically one speciality and then there's some specialities that actually counts all of them individually yeah so there we remove them we're gonna miss the speciality then okay give me just a second i'm trying to get over here to my computer right now okay my any desk is 443 584457 okay you should be getting a problem please go ahead and accept that okay so we go to settings practice and then we go to provide our tax code so let's say if we select any of the can we pull up radiology john that's what i want to say sure there is not playing radiology maybe it's on the next page okay so you have diagnostic radiology but that's not what we was we were looking at though before remember it was different John it was it was very different see so we have different ones that we have this one we have this one we have this one if you notice all the codes are different so this radiology comes under chiropractor this one comes with clinic and i don't even know why though so hang on can i show you something so if i'm going into bob test and i go to referrals and i'm gonna do an outgoing referral okay specialty r a d you see how we have all these we have three here exactly we have three now let's say the total through radiologist correct right so now if we go back to the same page where we on and if he counsels you'll see three different ideologies uh okay c one two three oh we don't have radiology podiatrist we don't have radiologist chiropractor that is correct we just have radiology so what are these codes and who are they for i don't need those basically the main ones this is for everybody across the board for cure md so main is radiology and then they're is chiropractic clinic and then the prior automatically falls into those that's how it is that's for everybody in curemd currently not just your practice because i tested on a bunch of them and then i actually asked one of my senior seniors and he showed it to me is like this is how it is this is something we cannot remove and this is how it is because any there's a possibility that one of those radiologies it's actually one of the suburbs uh specialities that's getting attached to that uh speciality so there's no way to delete because all of them the codes are completely different they're not the same if you look at this radiology code is 111 and the other one is 261 q r and the third one is 213 how do i customize the one that we use Thats connected to swing up a theory and lennox hill radiology how do i customize it so because the doctors flipping out because every time they go to issue a referral let me ask you something else when the doctor goes in here to do a referral hold on a second let's go back to top and just see what is the difference with over here why do i see clinical and then down here i see what is this for radiology that this is to add a radiology order then why are we adding radiology under referrals for the staff i don't understand what is the speciality of the provider now those radiology the one you just open earlier those are for the test i'm confused give me that again the one you just look under the uh referred those are the speciality attached the providers that's why those are there wait a minute which which one we should i don't know which one you're the one please take open show me the one we're talking about the referrals right here when you click on outgoing those are the speciality now the one you were just asked me earlier right here the one you were able to see it under clinical this one this is for the lab results and tests when they ordered the radiology tests for what lab no no lab when they when they ask for radiology test for the patient this is where they go and order the test that's what this is for when the patient needs to radiology test this is where the provider or the nurse comes and they placed the order for the patient to go and get the radiology test done see these are the some uh samples of their radiologies so we've been doing it incorrectly then because myself as well as my staff has been going into here for the radiology and i didn't know that so they shouldn't be doing it they're they should be doing it down here that is correct it says radio is that what you're telling me that is correct so we we're gonna have to change that because we're doing it the wrong way then because um now another thing is hold on a second rick so for radiology uh which companies do can i order through here when i click on it now click on the drop down there you go ah oh wow i never knew this i never knew this and then you can actually see the patient you want to build a patient directly you wanna build insurance how you wanna do it it's completely up to you right so now once the once the report comes back if they that comes back into the e h r and the doctor reviews it then it'll be under completed or acknowledged correct correct mhm that's interesting because i never knew that we've been doing it incorrectly all this time i never knew that if if you want uh but i can uh request you can go ahead and log in new tickets said you need uh training on the radiology tests or how to offer test or how to select the test somebody from the integration team is gonna give you showed it to me i think you just showed it to me but again i i've been sending all radiology through here now those are referred only for to select the speciality of the provider i understand that now but i never knew that i never knew that we learn new things every day right that's that's what we do that's a good thing okay john well thank you for clarifying it for me and um this way now another thing it says how how are we sending this when these go out for radiology can you answer that question do you know how we can see whether or not referrals i'm in the wrong thing again down here in clinical radiology how can we send the referral how does it go is it faxes and emails how how does it go this is something that's actually gonna go to the labs directly this this is what we don't have an interface with one of them so how does it get to the lab for that i'm gonna let me i'm gonna have to talk to the lab department they're gonna be able to better assist you so if you don't mind can you hold on for a moment let me grab someone from the lab well because right here he's waking up a series we have a buyer directional with them but for lennox hill we do not so my question is if the doctor puts the referral in let's say he puts the referral in and set up the referral how do see what the referrals up top here we hit either fax or email it to the to the specialist i think but for me um i think after you select the diagnosis for what what's the reason behind the test it takes you the next page okay once that's all done you can save yeah and then you can give it to the patient i believe ah so we don't so but we give it directly to the patient there you go and then patient go to the lab and give it to them and they'll do it this alright i'm gonna have to have a brief training with everyone at the front desk because we've all been doing it incorrectly that is correct and if you still need some more details or questions integration team is gonna be able to assist you someone uh there's a person sean or my uh nick nick they're gonna be able to assist you with your concerns well no i think you've shown it to me but thank you very much you're welcome any other questions or concerns no no thank you for your help i appreciate have a wonderful day"}}, {"id": 463, "data": {"call_id":

"data": {"call_id": "1622563978.1207695.txt", "text": "hello hello this is josh this is lisa yes this is she hey lisa sorry i think i missed your call time for today regarding kiosk um do you have time right now uh to discuss all right perfect so um okay how do you wanna start alright so let's start where we left off now the signatures explain that to me again i have i can have a patient sign a consent form um the second signature can only be hard noted to one registered nurse mhm because yeah only one person probably we can get that in uh let me just reconfirm real quick because uh usually the workflow i was suggesting was that we get an electronic signature for the patient and the nurse whoever you know is present at the moment could sign it now uh let's see if we were to get one nurse let me see if there's a flag we have for that one second let's see current user yeah i think what we could do is add in a flag for current user what that would do is uh whatever user name we log into chaos with that name would be the one that will populate so i could change for example the name of uh chaos to be like for one of the nurses for example uh the user name at least what that would do is i could get their first and last name put in the consent form who's your first name last name and that way you know whichever one person you have you know they could be the one who could uh yeah i'll be the ones whose name would be available on the consent okay on consent alright that would probably be me if we choose to go with that okay what are other options well the other option uh like i said the other one would be that you get an electronic signature for the patient that would be he just has to hit agree his name would come out automatically next to the patient name field other than that uh you know the witness could be uh you know you that's uh or anyone else who's available could be signing off on it and the signature would appear there whatever you know we populate the flight for signature for the business okay alright and then the second person is the one who signed okay got it alright options we have for you and then both ways we can tie in the physician signature to the note physician signature to the i'm sorry to the note or to the consent form to this consent to the consent form yeah at the end of course uh the provider can see the consent under you know the consent section and and he can just electronically sign it from there just hit sign from his profile and his signature you know appear at the bottom okay is there any way that a nurse can go into the consent form from you know how it creates a document uh how to create um you mean if they could go in and the nurse could be the one manually signing off on is that what you mean is there a way for us to e sign on there well the e signing wouldn't it is possible maybe through uh an ipad but again the problem with that would be that you would not have a specific uh place in the consent form to sign it would just appear at the bottom of the signature for the nurse okay okay i'm not i'm writing this down specific please okay so i might be able to do that and then put into our documentation um who witnessed the signature just so if it was ever contested in a court setting that the actual documentation from the procedure says that this person consent like they witnessed the consent form being signed and have them put their name into the the actual chart of the patient and then have their signature at the bottom of that form even though it's not following on that line it's still there mhm uh if you can have that something you can document and yeah of course legality that's what i'm trying to find my way around the legal illegal thing that we have to figure out okay and then you were talking about let me let me ask after i'm gonna give me three options i'm gonna find out and then i'm gonna call you and let you know but walk me through the rest of it like as far as um you were saying it would make more sense to do the forms at every visit is every visit only the ones uh that are for a specific reason so if you have uh uh for example let's just say um what's your speciality what what's what uh what's your speciality as a you know clinic vascular surgery center so you can have certain ones for like uh uh the pre op certain ones for uh you know initial visit certain ones for a follow up visit uh you know depending on what kind of forms you have so for initial visit uh you know whatever whoever is coming in for their initial you know you have a bunch of consent forms or uh you know a bunch of stuff that you want them to sign you can just put an initial visit for them that way you know as soon as they're coming in we're just gonna pick that one easy obvious so yeah they're gonna be getting a bunch of forms so you can keep it on every visit for that reason only that way whenever you you know put an initial visit everyone will get you know the complete package of you know customer consent forms that you need them to sign okay so when i i put patient responsibility um every visit or can i do it every day but it would be have to be you know linked to a certain appointment reason that's what i'm saying so like initial for example i will link that um you know a bunch of forms to that specific appointment reason that way the patient with me you know every one of them once they're getting into chaos okay okay oh i see what you can do the drop down list and then drop them in there okay indeed yeah okay alright i can do that uh um and uh you did get the other part which i was explaining you regarding you know the witness signature once they're uh it has to be done by an ipad or you know perhaps i have i have ipads um i'm just trying to get set up mhm because the way it works there is a certain permission under our uh preferences so if you go into for example um let me just uh for your user so if you go into uh your home page for under my preferences at the very bottom there's an option for a scan and print under my preferences just check that and once you go in at the very bottom there's an option for preferred signature method you would wanna put an ipad and hit save client set up is not installed okay you might need to do that if you're running it on chrome because you have the client does need to run so if you can download that installed at first um actually it would be easier if i could do a screen share with you do you mind oh sure let me give you my number 1 2nd let me just pull this up yep and if you can give me the number okay it's 315 six 46797 okay now uh regarding the signature method they told you it could be you know done through the ipad or it could be done if you have like a script signature uh pod so right now okay you're here uh can you just text it out of here alright just leave just leave this for now this will only be important if you're actually uh gonna be setting up like a signature pad or something with the computer okay oh we wanna close this out yep i'm just gonna select ipad for now this is the one for uh if you're running it with an ipod so for example let's take this one uh go into contents and put in like a consent okay so let's do um oh sorry yeah that one's good bilateral angiogram that was on okay so imagine this one this one was already in you know the patient already signed through kiosk imagine that for now once that was done of course this option is available for the provider to sign if the nurse wanted to sign as well we have an option for the e signature right here if you know your pod was configured you could do it through here if you're doing it through an ipad you'd automatically be taken to a screen where you could you know manually signed and the signature would appear at the bottom after that was done yeah and after that uh you just have to you know hit sign the provider has to hit sign here and as you can see the electronic signature will be at the bottom if you set up like uh there's also an option that the provider can have his own uh being a handwritten signature attached to his profile as well so every time he signed the signature would appear at the bottom as well whether it be like a letter or a provider know if that's something you're interested in we can also take care of that as well um having them set that up yeah because we can if you put in a request for that of course we can have you know we just need a sample of you know the provider signature and uh we can make that active so you know every time he electronically signs a provider his signature with a pair with this electronic signature as well send a copy of signature okay so yeah if you can send over the copies put them you know attach them in the ticket and yeah someone should be able to take care of that attaching it to the profiles and making it active from the settings so uh get those signatures work so it when i open a consent form i just go the patient can sign from the ipod you just go to the bottom and you see the image right here click on here and you get it open right here right now this one signed if yuan sign it before that the nurse will have the option right here uh if you're in an ipod of course you'll just be able to click here or if you have a you know a script like i said uh attached you could you know just have the nurse sign right from the computer by clicking here okay once that's done i just hit sign the provider has to hit sign that will be the workflow so i would just would i click here or just sign it and i'll go to the bottom and the sign would go at the bottom of course and clicking here uh this option would take the signature at the bottom as well like i said this is like an image that is stored now so i can't make any changes in that but the signature can appear at the bottom i like that one so what i need to send you a um a list of our nurse signatures as well no the nurse signatures are an important because uh those would have to be manually populated the doctors uh would be the ones you know electronically signing so there uh would be the their signatures would be the one that would require if you want them you know available here as well let me just double check something in your settings uh let's see hrh uh okay signature on sign note or letter yep that's the one as long as we check this one off and it's safe or actually um i'm just gonna show you how it's done as well if you can figure it out manually up to you or you can put in a ticket but all you need to do on your side is uh just go into whichever user you want to associate the signature with uh what's your profile so i can show you lisa lisa parker uh i was unable to type in anything so uh you see the option for signature here you can upload like an image file here so as long as it's like the correct size and everything will populate so as an example we can choose something to show you uh let's see um i can create one real quick if you can create with you mm but it has to be an image again let me just take a screenshot just take a screenshot of anything the uh for example just type something in take a screenshot of it and we can okay let's take that we can make it all fancy if we want to okay there we go that looks more like it let's take that let me get there that would be better if i could let's go okay okay i got the screenshot let me say if that no uh let's see okay here it is uh copy and paste have your here we go okay oh i think the service blinking in the background but it's fine take an example anyway so um okay let's go in uh settings upload a file okay so imagine you are the provider right now going to sign the consent what would happen is you go into a letter it's signed and this is how it would appear so this is for the provider part again like i said for the nurses uh they just have to go in through this option alright any other queries or questions that you have no did we figure out what um what happened we started using last week and the um files weren't being uploaded into the folders file from being uploaded um let me check that real quick because i wasn't able to detect anything of the store let me just review your settings real quick what you guys have so far so okay you have all these um set to only once okay so you mean all of them weren't appearing or a few of them like whenever the the ones with the patient filled out weren't coming up now look i associated these with the specific visit a lot of them um to put only once with that uh with that actual visit um but like the intake forms and all those that's the one that we should set to every visit but when they fill them out they weren't populating mm intake forms uh like i said it would have been better if you got them under custom forms uh i don't know if you guys actually created the mass custom forms but it would actually make a lot more sense uh let's see if i could we can mark them as mandatory so that's another thing and it actually provides more options you know uh for multiple choice selections uh compared to consent forms but you have to you know agree and sign a few of these i don't think they would have made sense if uh you were to put the mask consents right for the patient i agree at the end yeah like this one responsibility form these these are consents the other ones i think they're more like uh custom forms right or like push uh intake forms so these are like the consent form for the actual procedure these are the procedures okay these are the procedures alright make's sense these are all consent forms yes all of these are consent forms for procedures alright alright then then that makes perfect sense but you're saying that a few of them are not populating correct right like that right it's not going into the chart alright let me check on that right now could you give me the uh credentials you have for um yes it is our password hold on i'm gonna have to look at whatever kills me i don't want to give you the wrong one hmm oh it's s a c uh f and that's the password or the okay s a c user name okay mhm user name and the password is okay let's go with that and uh how many consents they do you have that are uh you know set to any reason um should be responsibility it's a patient responsibility you send disclosure um covid 19 screening okay all right let me try to fill some out and we can see if those populate so let me take a new test station that probably has not had an appointment through chaos quso let's do uh test station three um okay i was looking to make something generic and okay trees the home number okay let's book a test appointment with this one oh and which location do you have can you set up with allentown okay it should be allentown and own town and well uh yeah you need a separate user name for like a second location if you wanted it because it only functions as one location for one ipad that is the normal how do we do the 2nd 1 we'll just create a new user for you for the second location and once you log in you know the second ipad you'll know it's for the second location okay can we just do essay i'm sorry scc which one um for the second location s a c v uh yeah sure just uh uh you know let us know when you're ready with the ipad or if you have it already just send us the location name do you have it over here under the calendar um do i have it over here the location yeah bottom street dc dc yep we can definitely put that in just uh put in a ticket for it and uh we can get another user name set up for you and you can use that one for the you know second location okay now for this one let me just look a test appointment is patient three this is not one of the ones that are associated with the consent form right yes it is it is yeah so they'll have to all doppler visit um and see i need to i need to clean that up let me do that one then if you need to clean that of course we can help with that as well uh basically we can't remove an appointment reason once it's put in but what we usually do is we uh remove association for the provider that way it's no longer viewable when you're scheduling an appointment for that provider okay so let me check in and just to make sure i'm just gonna check if the patient has any consent forms okay nothing so far okay let's check if the consent form sudden uh yeah i got all of them is that all of them where did you find him uh well when i was going into all four of them okay so they're not gonna go under custom forms or documents yeah they don't uh they don't popularly consents and that is actually something i wanted to reconfirm we did use to have them at some point under consents uh let me ask our technical team about that as well but yeah usually you see them uh for sure you see them under the consent section under your profile okay and that's for cleaning up your appointment reasons if you wanted to remove a few um going to your practice the an appointment reason that's where you get your list if you wanted to uh say you know remove any one of them what you could do is uh just an associate uh whatever speciality listed that way you could remove it for every wider if you wanted to you know let the appointment reason be for a certain provider you could just uh add it for the certain provider and he would be the only one on his profile that appointment reason would be if you don't want the appointment reason you know for any provider you can just remove all of the specialities from this section to available and it's safe but no longer appear on any list mhm okay alright right any other questions um no i think you got it and then i will um let me talk to doctor ever actually i think we're just gonna use the just the two signature method i have the patient sign off on the ipad and then have the nurses upload their image mm the nurses you have the provider doesn't need to sign it then you have the nurses signing would make sense if you could set them up you know with signatures on there uh the user profile because if the provider needs to sign it as well that's where there would be a bit of more confusion where you have to use you know the ipod to manually have the nurses sign okay alright then the nurses are gonna have to manually side with the ipod then so how is that like if the doctor has to do the final sign off on that consent form then you said it would have to be one nurse the signs of the ipod mhm one nurse the signs with the ipod and then the provider would go in and then formally you know sign off on the note that would close the note to any more edits as well so our only problem is that we have we have like five nurses and the same one isn't always back there doing yeah that's that's totally fine because of course like i said the nurses signature would be manually input so they'd be manually in putting their signature every time okay alright so if the nurse were to go to use the ipad and just regular cure and chrome go to the consent form and hit that little icon is a bit weird looks like a a signature pad or like a little pen or something signing oh uh go back into consents oh i'm in contact that's why i'm looking at it funny registration uh profile registration at the top left hand side expand that then going to profile no concerns profile i'm writing this down because i get i get all backed up sometimes okay so go into consents they'll come down here open it up at the bottom you have the letter and if the unsigned here that's where you'll see it yep near the picture yep signature of course you won't see any of this um went on the ipad direct you you know directly into uh you know a screen where you could manually put in your signature okay alright do i need to download this onto the ipod uh no nothing of the sort of the ipod uh like i said the configuration is for ipad so it automatically just takes you to the screen where you need to sign this is only for chrome girl alright okay so then she'll hit here they'll sign save it and then the doctor can go in and sign it yep perfect okay i have any questions i'll call you back alright sounds good thank you very much alright bye bye bye"}}, {"id": 465, "data": {"call_id": "1622826449.1306624.txt", "text": "how may i help you hello this is ben fisher calling from curemd may i please speak with

i have another question could help me yeah i had a previous ticket regards the printing and we're still having the same problem so i can't remember the name of the representative that helped me what was the problem it was regarding the printing like it's it's printing with large font he tried to change some things and he told me try it the following day i tried it and we are still having the same problem no problem what you can do is once you're done with him today you can uh log another ticket for the printing issue that you're having and uh someone from the it would get back to you don't worry okay no problem thank you you're very welcome connecting you with him okay thank you hi this is tim from curemd yes i am how are you i'm good how are you good thank you i have something very very simple team i submitted a claim to united healthcare with the modifier 95 because it's telehealth yes like i put the place of service office and i put the procedure and then modifier 95 for telehealth and then it was rejected i don't know if it was rejected from the insurance or from your clearing house you know saying uh that i'll tell you what did it say it said that telehealth modifiers will be considered informational only okay what does that mean i have no idea but i mean i've been doing that for like a few months and it has been working so i mean did they change the rules or should i just remove the modifier or what do you suggest i do i'll have to check just give me a second i'll just uh take a look at the rejection reason okay no problem he said did you select a place of service to our office i selected as office because in the past when i used to put two they would say no you can use it as office okay you know what i mean yeah okay so this is a smart added rejection smart added rejection is kind of a heads up that you needed to uh use place the service too so it's okay you can just resubmit the claim and it will get accepted so resubmit the claim with what what changes do i have to do you you do not have to make any changes because this is a smart added rejection and smart added rejection means that this is uh a rejection from the insurance but it's just to make sure that it is not um like it has all the proper requirements so if you uh resubmitted it will get accepted okay so let me ask you a question i leave that piece of services as office yes you can leave it as it is because you have received the modifier with 95 exactly because you have received uh the payments on uh this configuration right yes yes i have but i don't know if they changed anything or what you know what i mean like sometimes they change stuff and we're not aware of i agree but this uh rejection does not show that it has uh changed anything like the insurance does not change anything so you are good to resubmit the claim okay so i should just say corrected and then go to the bucket and fix it right exactly mark it as corrected okay no problem but if i remove the 95 i mean maybe it will it will work right or i shouldn't do that uh i would recommend that you should not and you should uh just submit the claim as it is okay no problem i'll do that and hopefully it will not get rejected again thank you so much time no problem you have a great day bye bye you too"}}, {"id": 470, "data": {"call_id": "1623072461.1335151.txt", "text": "michigan

session so it is strange enough we don't have your name give me a minute one time that i need login password but i don't know if they emailed me or not okay so will you you you will be seeing patients on because the provider okay i'm gonna ask a stupid question so please excuse me for that uh what's the name of the practice maybe i got the practice wrong healthcare kidney health care because we have multiple practices with bina and um she said doctor usman i wasn't i wasn't sure with practice yeah it's uh kidney health care and yep got it give me a minute please issues period stable patient may proceed this surgical international port placement we look for the work up at this point period clinical dynamically stable otherwise period thank you for staying on hold doctor so you have uh your user id and password on the screen it's d r u s m a n okay uh can you make the screen bigger somehow i cant see much um you can make it bigger on your end there will be an option to yeah okay where do you see that d r u s m a an dr usman man okay mhm and then i have also a message to you a link on teamwork have you received it uh let me check okay um what message i'm looking at the method that i sent you i'm sending it again it will pop up on your screen you got it okay i did not i don't know uh no problem i'll email it to you no problem so when i email you the link you can log into the link and use use the same um user id and password that i that you've written down so okay and then your password is going to be cure md all lowercase and then it's going to ask you to um default a password for yourself now i saw that you were um doing um dictation so which software do you use oh the dictation is we do like a model fluency flags m model fluency flags hospitals okay so this is at the hospital yeah i i don't have any personal okay got it i i because some some providers they they have a personal softwares like dragon so how do you envision that you will use cure md you know i i may have to do dragon because that's what they told me dragon is um compatible with your software yes dragon is very much compatible and it's also it also picks the medical terms if you buy the medical version of it so let's go ahead and i'll show you our workflows to create note is it okay we've if we jump to the to the soap note or do you want to do a specific note for the training uh no no so not is fine you can just yeah you can show me but you know i have been using different different softwares all along i'm pretty much comfortable and if you show me one like quickly uh how to get to the how to do the billing how to um right um orders then i will understand it will be not a big deal i use as outpatient in my hospital practice and i'm comfortable with multiple like if you can just yea multiple systems got it so i'll show you the workflow so this is our patient module here the second module and i'm going to record this call just in case this conference will now be recorded so when you open a patient then on the right side you have an option to expand provider notes and you'll be able to see that there are two notes that are already open for the patient when you click provider notes it will open the notes for you so there are two notes you can either pull open the previous ones or you can add a new one in order to add a new note there's an option that says add provider note you can click on it you can select the name of the provider and then you can select the templates so over here in the in the drop down you can have as many templates as you want so we have follow up kidney we have soap note kidney and we have an easy soap note so let's say we go for a soap note kidney and then you can select the appointment reason and then hit create and who's gonna be doing scheduling for you is it going to be one of your staff members yeah alright so this is your for soap notes so this is how it is going to open now from this point onwards everything is pretty straightforward all you have to do is you can clip you can keep clicking on the components and you can keep adding information for example you can add complaints so let's say that patient is here for let's say uh pain abdominal pain and then you're gonna select abdominal pain and then you can also select pattern and if you want to it's kind of a very drop down based and then you can accept it and system will converted in generation that are 24 24 day old well female patient presents for the abdominal pain this and that then you have review of systems you can click open a component so there are some review of systems there you can pick any template this one you have general hint cardio so on and so forth so what you have to do is you can select able to conduct your activities right things like that so the things that patient is going to admit are going to be positive let's say that the patient says that they are they admit that they are comfortable they admit that they are able to do their activities they're able to um exercise the deny exercise intolerance let's say and then you can go to him you can say negative bleeding gums no blending spots then you can go to respiratory fever let's say fever is positive so i'm i'm gonna just select few and then you can accept it so what's gonna happen is the the things that you marked as positive will be admit the things that you marked as negative will be denied so this is where you can ask questions is it going to your system is going to be done by your nurse or by you you know most of the time by the nurse but sometimes they they are overwhelmed or busy sure i will do it um but i need to put this in the deal like a template like i can just bring that over and change on the template instead of clicking every single time we can do that yeah i just need that how to build my template so that i can go if you want to build your templates what you can do is you can open uh duly tablets you can open a test patient doesn't matter you can go to every system you can click click click you can click on click really what you wanna do and once you are done you can click save as a template check this box and accept when you will do that it's going to ask you for the name of the data template whatever you do it will be saved as a template and will be pulled over okay let me see let me show you like can you show me again why should i do i go to the review of system on this uh like on this note out so i'm going to be on the right side left side yeah so it's over here it's right in the middle this is your review of systems you can click you can click on it system okay yeah you can click on it and it will open for you okay when you open it you can click the system first and all of the characteristics will show at the bottom okay got it and then once you're done clicking and you feel like that your template is ready then check this small box that says save as data template where is that small box which one this one are you able to see it no i can't see that maybe it's in the bottom trying to expand your screen and see if you're save as data template okay the last one i i see that i okay and once you see that then you can hit accept or what i can do is i can simply screenshot it and i can give you the steps okay and then i can put in the numbers there so let's say this is your okay this is actually four sorry three mm okay so i'm gonna send you the screenshot so this is your first option that you have to check these boxes then second you have to save this data template and third you have to hit accept once that is great yeah once you do that about you you're gonna email me that yeah yes i'll email it to you once you when she's the fourth step is that you can simply put in the name of the data template over here so this would be your 4th step now i will also i will also show you how to i'll also give you control so that you can have some hands on experience with how how do you open the note okay and then you have medical history you can open medical history it is very straightforward from this point onwards you can simply select the disease or the procedure um the patient had gone for example patient had diabetes simply select diabetes and then if there are more disease like if you wanna have hypertension you can check that and accept it so what happens is just to give you an idea all these blue links that you see here every blue link is clickable and once you click on it let's say if it's medications it is simply gonna open a box where you can add the medications there will be an add button there and you can start adding the medications for the patients most of these things are gonna be done by the nurse but i'm just showing you that what is the layout of our note so i selected i hit accept and it has become part of the note the note keeps on building as you can see as soon as you you keep adding information it keeps building so what i'm gonna do now is give you a little bit of i'm gonna give you controls and then i'll see if you can use my system and practice a little yeah okay let's see if you can you can't i think because you're on the on the web version that could be the reason okay and then you have i'll just go through it no problem then you have allergies this is where you can adding the allergies at allergan and then you can add let's say peanut containing products so this is uh everything is based so we have a concept of libraries everything is kind of a searching things you can open open a link like this sorry what the blue link you're gonna open it it's gonna show you it's gonna open a small window inside and you can put in the information there that's how this whole uh note is designed can you hear me doctor"}}, {"id": 474, "data": {"call_id": "1622670424.1258.txt", "text": "we care pediatrics this is melissa how may i help you hello this is ben fisher calling from curemd and may i please speak with melissa this is she hi melissa i'm sorry i was actually going through your update on the ticket so uh you so so you want to talk about the report so i noticed a lot of patients that were on there were under 12 years old um and then it was only um it was only um because there was more than one phone number over in that other side where the phone numbers are it's not transferring correct um but i'm just gonna end up i'm just gonna do it myself it's just gonna take me a long time to make an excel sheet just so it'll actually work the way it would if it wasn't done and have different names on there because once i started going through it i noticed that there was kids that were under 12 years old on that sheet so i just stopped going through it and um here you go thank you have a good day um and just gonna make it myself alright so so you're only looking for the patients who are who turned 12 mhm from 12 and up 12 and above okay because you know that day when we were talking so the time frame we were selecting for the date of birth was from 2009 until 2021 but i guess now you you want uh uh 20 2009 and prior to that right so any patient who has an and and and below what made

totally okay so we have never really scan documents into our system we kind of wanted to start um and so whenever i am just gonna use this one person as an anticipation as an example um whenever i go here and hold on i am drawing a blank forgive me i think it was into consultation reports no that is the one i made this consultation result okay and i said upload i am gonna literally because i just got something for this gentleman and so i could do that and that is there so i did fix that and then here it wants me to select something in this bracket here because i am not selecting something it does not let me save it so select some consultation as well i see okay so that is your issue yes i am i am not i am pretty sure this is what i was taught last week um when they told me to upload and they showed me the folders i could use so but i noticed that for a consultation results i need to pick like a sub reason and i cannot okay so but i do not see any other options either sure no problem just give me one moment okay thank you no problem thank you for calling in cold every year she is the mom of the owner of that company and so she prides herself and making that phone call every year to see if there is anyone that needs to uh be given training customer service i think it is so cute yep constantly gonna move the mouse for a moment okay i am sorry elizabeth did you say something i am just gonna move my mouse to print some results for a moment to the doctor okay no problem okay thank you for staying on hold elizabeth are you there sure i am here okay alright so lets go ahead and see how we can solve this so now uh what is the name of the patient that you are trying to uh the results for uh edward he just as an example just a test one because i just found something into the system for him that i know is not a consult note but i know it is for him i just wanted to try it out with that alright then in that case i will just tell you what the workflow is so uh just go on patients and then you just select the patient for example in this case it is early edward and then you would go over here uh under clinical uh sure sorry right over here under consultation just click on that okay so that is uh some kind of order the results okay okay you are following me okay and then you just add on the result and then you just fill this part of the order and then the procedure codes whatever is required so you are just gonna click on that select the uh the c p t that uh was performed and once you have done that all you need to do is before you continue maybe i am asking for the wrong thing just because um the cpt codes are gonna come out of the building and what i am trying to scan is another doctors consultation note so we are a pcp office and primary care office and we often have to send patients to specialists so those doctors often send us the consultation notes from the from the visit with our patient so that we know what the next steps will be for their care so say we see a patient that is um that has a heart condition when we send them to a cardiologist they send us over a consultation note and that is what i am trying to scan into the console uh consultation tab maybe i am using the wrong tab for us okay so so i would not have sequels for that i literally would just be having a report from a specialist okay so then you can just select the procedure that was performed from this i would i would not have one that is what i am saying so what for example uh say you were our patient you came in you had chest pain doctor would examine you and send you to a cardiologist that doctor would say thank you for sending uh this station over they were seeing on the state this was the assessment we found that he had high blood pressure we would have no quoting at all from that specialist but we would have is this note so i am trying to scan in this consultation note from a doctor we referred the patient too so maybe it is not the appropriate uh tab i see okay so okay i see alright let me uh let me just look for that work flow just give me one moment thank you because as you are doing it i see that it has what you are showing me has a similar properties to what i use for our office and what i am trying to stand in is for an outside specialist that we do not have any information on billing for so what i am standing in is a report okay so this is kind of a referral it is a pretty much a referral yeah thank you so much for staying on hold are you there elizabeth okay i see so uh the kind of referral that you were talking about i think the best way to do that uh would be by uh let me just show you so you can just go on patient over here then okay so i would be able to show you the workflow going forward then he can go on referrals okay so since it is an uh incoming referrals so this would be the workflow for that so you can just add on over here incoming mhm okay and then uh you know you can just uh adding the details over here so this was referred to the uh you know the name of the provider so the doctor kayur then referred by so no uh you know and i really appreciate your patience with me but it is it is similar to this but it is the opposite it is us who is referring out so what it is we are a primary care doctor so in essence are patients come to us for anything and everything so if someone comes to us and says hey my ear hurts we have to send them to a ear specialist so in essence what i am trying to find a place uh to scan and keep track of is reports for the specialist that we send the patients so they they do not come to us from a specialist they go to a specialist because of us but you are getting i am sorry sorry to cut you off uh but if i understand you are you are still getting the report from the other provider is not that right but it is only because we were the refer they were referred by you so you see where it says referred to that patient was not referred to us we were referring them does that make sense uh yes yes that uh that does make sense so uh let me double check on that give me one moment and he did not want to walk he collapsed on me i had him running i need to use a credit card i got him even glass game yes uh elizabeth you  are right so uh it is just gonna be a referral and then it is just gonna be outgoing referrals the same thing so it will be referred by and then uh doctor kayyur referred to and now is the name over here or do we need to i will have to add the uh people that we have been using okay so you can go ahead and then add uh the reference provider details from here okay and then uh you would need to uh and all the details and then you know assigned to the reason uh and and you need to mention at least the reference number or the pin number so either one of them and if you do not have that for now you can just add in any number uh but what needs to be filled out um and then once you have that uh you would need to uh go on diagnosis and then uh select the diagnosis that you have and the procedures similarly for that and i will show you an example so we will just go ahead and uh at this visits the number of visits so we will just put in one sign this for two alright uh is this a test patient oh this is this an actual patient that is okay i can remove it after okay so lets see if it saves okay so we will just add 111 okay and once you have that you will you will get this for the appointments and then over here you will be able to upload the document that you were trying to upload so thank you so much you are welcome so uh try to do this in yourself uh and if you are having any difficulties just call me back or i am just gonna call you back to confirm whether you have done this and then i can just go ahead and close the ticket okay alright and so our receptionist is telling me so so thank you for that i appreciate that if you if it is not too much work if you could give me a call back maybe tomorrow what i will do is i will fiddle around with it today and add other things in and i will write down any hiccups i bump into so that i can address them with you all at once um and then she says she is having the same problem when she is trying to upload results for the lab kind of previously uh how we were previously doing in the last window where i was showing you in the document manager when she selects the lab and wants you to select a sub kind of category and it does not have options specific from it does not let her upload results there okay so elizabeth in that case uh uh so what she can do is she can just log in the ticket for that specific concern and uh once it will be assigned and we will just give them a call back and assist her with that would that be okay that's fine sure okay and so again i'll just give you a call back tomorrow and what time should i call you back the same time the same time it's fine perfect okay so i'll just give you a call back tomorrow okay thank you so much my pleasure you have a wonderful day take care you as well thanks bye bye"}}, {"id": 477, "data": {"call_id": "1622818739.1300356.txt", "text": "welcome to arthritis relief centers our office hours are 8:30 a.m.

prescribe it i dont know why so youre saying they can see the medication in here but they are unable to proceed with it what does that mean exactly and in in in baby terms oh its in there but we cant prescribe it yeah is that what  you why mean  yes thats what i mean mhm yes we know its in there but we cant prescribe it to anybody alright does the provider have the details with the dosage and frequency that we can go ahead and add so let me show you this is the medication right but the sig that needs to be put in whats the sig so the dosage that includes the number of days the frequency uh the frequency okay so the sig has to be after let me ask her about that hold on lets see make sure shes doing that lets see he said that to me okay so let me just tell him that okay so yes so you remember the first thing you were on where um you couldnt you were clicking on it and you couldnt get in uhm thats what shes having trouble why cant you get in what do you have to do to get in we know the name is there but like you were having trouble when you click on it the first before you went into wherever you just did she um cant well you cant click on it like you were having trouble when we first started if you go back let me let me see give me a moment please right yeah yeah let me just so this is the test patient okay yeah so when you go yeah you went too far yeah when you go in here and you click on it what happens oh it goes right so basically this is what i was referring to the sig needs to be you know defined by the provider no go out at it at for a minute and go back remember when you were having trouble and it was yeah so what what is she doing wrong then so let me show you so here she would put in the name yep yeah right there so when this comes up since this hasnt been prescribed before its coming up in here so she needs to actually go ahead put in the days the quantity added this is me going ahead and putting it as an medication once this is done it comes up in the system for this patient for prescriptions shed go in here hit continue and and thats what she does but this but this part never comes up for her so if you could scroll down put in the prescription and try prescribing because its missing the number of days its missing the quantity whether its a box whether its a buff thats everything that the provider needs to put in only then it would go out since this medicaid application was not in the system so we went ahead and had this added now the sig uh now by that i mean the dosage that doctor that again what yeah im gonna have to try it again so yeah so now where did you go for this medication so you will go in medications no if i just try to hit prescription which is what i would do so i try to add to write a prescription and i put the drug in so youd it doesnt come up so you select this and youd hit prescribed correct i dont get medications if i go into prescription and i go to add okay its the bottom you have to fill in so what does she have to fill in at the bottom she needs to put in the dosage the days whether its a box you know the further details how many days is she prescribing this for if theres a refill for it yes i know how to thats fine i know how to do that i its just that before it was not giving me the outlaw it wasnt giving me the option to do that when i clicked on it now it is okay now now its fine before it was default to the coupon code and it wasnt allowing me to even prescribe it so now it looks like okay so you said would you want to try it now what right now its working so were good right this minute so you can take us so they dont keep calling us i think there was i think there was at some point a uh uh no you know what do they call that thing that we you make but its cool because i never do it yeah

this is mindy from dermatology laser and surgery today we discovered that um all the uh all the confirmations and reminders in my system is all messed up and haven't been going out which is a problem that a ticket has been created and so i know that they're working on it but aside from that here's my question when i have a an outside appointment with a doctor right um and i get a confirmation and when i have a uh an appointment for a haircut my beauty salon they ask me to either respond with a c for a confirmation or y for yes um and is curemd capable of doing something like that uh as per as my best understanding and information this is a one way communication that means you can notify application with whatever information you want however in order for a patient to respond back they either need to uh give you a call back uh or they can you know choose any other mediums such as an email or something but yes the uh confirmation text alerts that they received they cannot reply back to them um so they they can't mm i'm afraid that there's no such option available for now right now is that a suggestion that could be made or something yes definitely yes we always welcome the precious suggestions from our valuable clients and uh there there can be an option for the patients to you know respond back to the text sms alerts that they're going so what i can do for you is i can escalate this suggestion to the relevant department and they will definitely consider this option by curemd however i cannot commit our promise that this will be available in the near future however it would definitely be considered for the possibilities that if there is a possibility uh for this feature to be you know uh made available on curemd okay alright very good okay alright thank you you're welcome thank you so very much for contacting curemd and have a wonderful day ahead bye you too bye"}}, {"id": 488, "data": {"call_id": "1620676321.806686.txt", "text": "thank you so much for

morning i'm good so um are you in the office today so that we can check printing problem okay great i would like to do the screen share yeah well that's yeah that's not ever ever really possible because n y u blocks um any desk that's the one you guys use yeah we we normally use the software can you try downloading it any desk yeah i've tried multiple time i know what i'm talking about and it's it's blocked by n y u i have a n y u computer so it blocks it so how do you normally connect with the support usually they just walk me through it they usually just walking through it because we can't connect we can't share screens can you log in to can you just get on to the login page on internet explorer yeah but let me go through internet explorer because um that was the problem exactly like like you said um in the ticket you were not able to print hicfas from the internet explorer right and then when i printed and when i printed our connection is terrible when i printed it through chrome of course it's it's it's you know it's so small you can barely read it all right let me just lock yes it's not gonna work on chrome we'll have to fix it through the internet explorer okay so just get onto the log in page do not log in okay oh you just want me on okay i'm on the login page and you don't want me to log in okay on the internet explorer okay in the top right corner do you see a tool button that is right below the cross yeah click on that mhm in the list do you see compatibility view settings yes click on it uh-huh now there's that small box opened up do you do you see cure md dot com um where exactly in the small bar at the top or in the big box in the box on the bottom okay um there are two or 3 check box options right below the big box yes are they checked um is there anyone checked no okay please check all of those okay once the display internet sites and compatibility view and that's like in a light rail and then in dark it says use microsoft compatible compatibility list to check both of them the other one you can't check the one that's like gray is that checked or it's not it's not that but you but when i go to check it you can't check it because it's been like light gray alright check the other one use microsoft compatibility list okay alright just press just press close after you check that okay and then uh go ahead and log into alright now just look for any test patient patient and search for any cancellations okay are you on the patient's demographic yes okay so on this demographics page there is that print option on the top toolbar there just going to print and um click on demographics over there okay yeah alright so does it open up a separate screen or is it showing you the report or is it anything for yes or no something well yeah and i said yes and now it shows the patient demographic reports okay where do you see the print button on the top right or on the top left top left okay click on the print button okay see that box comes up and print again the print do you see your printer there select your printer and then click on print print print it automatically yeah but the problem is that we need the try the claims try the claims now see if there's any claims on here charges this doesn't have a head because it doesn't test doesn't have the insurance somebody else we can check the real patient okay i'll do that do you print the claims claim forms from the same printer or you have different printers same printer yep same printer performance it's not it's very rare that i have to print hicfa forms as you know these days but you know um every once in a while i do and uh you know i did last week and i couldn't do it and now i don't even remember what patient that was uh let's see okay so claim professional i'll do preview and then print review okay print okay no no it's doing it last week i wouldn't do it okay is that because you just upgrade updated that compatibility um well most likely it fixes because of that problem but i just wanted to confirm that if it's can you to that box where you see the printer to select and then you click on the print button because if you are able to get onto that box over there it means that the problem is not with curemd anymore now you are directly on the screen where you can select the printer in princeton so till that point if there is any problem then it's something that is related to curemd but at the moment you get onto that box is from where you can select the printer and hit the print button and if it's not printing from there then it means that the printer is somehow not connected or not last last week it wasn't getting to that box when i click the little up left corner on cure the print print this report uh it was giving me an error there right so that's what i was um you know pointing out that if it doesn't take you to that box it means that something is dropping you reaching there and the problem might be with them but it's letting you now so i think you should be all set now great thank you very much for your help i appreciate it no problem thanks for your time to have a good day"}}, {"id": 490, "data": {"call_id":

yeah i mean the the button has some dust in there uh normally um you know that can be cleared by just using you know alcohol to clean that button up because it evaporates and cleans up all the dust

otherwise if you can afford a new mouse please go for it okay okay thank you for your help alright no problem take care bye bye"}}, {"id": 492, "data": {"call_id": "1620736277.8130221.txt", "text": "thank you for calling curemd this is peter how may i help yes this is donna calling from um cardiology associates in mornington and i need to do a screen share because were trying to figure out this um e message thing okay you you would like to um know about the e messages or its not working for you well i dont know someone sent us some messages and i cannot figure out how to open them oh okay let me see one moment this is the tech support um i need to get you to the right person one moment okay thank you your welcome alright can you give me your any desk number please seven 66998762 okay im sending you the request okay i can see your screen over here okay so i need to open i think its this one what do i do from here oh well there is an attachment with a c c d a file for this particular patient over here if you click on this okay it will open up this c c d a file let me see if its over here it is oh okay alright let me let me go into your ccda tracking oh here we go so in the e messages uh someone is sending you uh the ccda files over here that are being uh received under the ccda tracking so for that patient that you opened um which one was that this one over here can you open that this right here john frisbie okay and we have the c c da for that let me click over here under c c d a tracking we have the ccda received as we can see if we click on this okay and pulls it up there okay and we see all the information over here okay so um okay so if it doesnt say that c c d a tracking on it or will they all say that uh well emessages are synchronized accordingly uh with the system in case if there is a ccda file which is normally transmitted um using emessages because theyre uh an end to end point encrypted and they normally uh get sent through a secure channel uh we are uh surescripts so whenever um there is a c c d a file being sent to you for a particular patient containing patients clinical information um the system will automatically detect that information and well um you know show you under the ccd a tracking tab over here and you have that information uh for this provider uh for these three patients as we can see um accordingly with the date and time when youve received it uh with e messages okay so um how do i get that can i just transfer that somehow to their documents um i think we can add it to update it within the patients chart let me check how we can do that im gonna put you on brief forward for that thank you so much for patiently holding the line so um as we receive the ccdas through the e messages there visible under the ccd a tracking were gonna go under that we can view all of that information now all of this information can be imported into this particular patients shot right away okay and in this patients there is a profile in cure md for this patient okay even if there isnt any you can still add this patient with all of this information uh within cure md and we can update that so we just need to click on reconcile over here okay and it says that patient already exists do you want to import demographics from this file note demographics currently stored in the patients chart will be over within okay so its giving us a warning over here that there is uh some demographics information that we can see for this patient over here if we accept the c c d a it will update and override all of that information that is under cure md with this particular patients information so we always prefer to press no on that okay okay okay okay so were gonna press no and all the rest of the information will be imported into the system except for the demographics because okay we already have that so should we press no over here okay so where does it go then its updating the information so over here um this is the information that we see under diagnosis under medication okay and summary of case these are the current medications okay these are the continue on so so does this override what we have listed under his medications and things like that it really should not um it it will only um you know add more information in the system but let me confirm that because we do see and accept button over here yeah yeah so yeah i dont know if doctor siegal would want his information over written and what i need to move is like the office visit notes and stuff mhm yeah let me see one moment let me let me check that person again he was on another line and he was assisting me because im from the techincal team okay and um yeah i have limited information on on this particular module over here let me check with him once again one moment away from the way that i dont know with my hands ive got two kids and a wife she okay hello uh thanks for holding the line donna um the representative is saying that hes gonna uh contact you uh once hes done with the call so ive been asked to you just document this particular concern we a support ticket and someone will call you back to assist with the matter okay all right and that way uh we wont be wasting more of your time so my apologies if someone uh the right person to contact you and help you with that okay its a question with e messages okay alright one moment i think im receiving another call one momemnt okay alright donna thanks for holding the line uh the representative actually called me and updated me about this information that we see over here yes so all the charts and everything like vitals and all the information is being sent from that provider to you in cure md these are some of the uh uh things along with that information that you received for this patient from the provider side that these are some of the current medications on descending providers side and these are the diagnosis that the other provider is using that is being sent to you so now its up to you if you would like to accept these medications uh and diagnosis in your system as well i mean if you prefer um the information that was added by the sending provider um under this particular patient this patient is having these current medications um as for the sender provider side if you would like to accept these medications as current medication for this particular patient you can select these and you can hit sign and similarly um there are certain diagnosis that are being used uh for this particular patient uh by the sending provider side and these are the dates when they were um you know added into the system for this patient i do see they are from way from the past from 2018 and all these medications are also very old so if that all of that information uh is very old and you do not prefer to have then you can keep it unchecked and click on sign there is some information against the medication like under summary of care i do see this one uh is like 10 days old uh for this medication is also 10 days old and there are certain other uh medications this is uh six days old so if you think that you would like to accept any of this information you can select that and hit it hit sign otherwise you can leave it the way it is and all the other information like the provider notes the patients chart and everything will be um you know imported already that that we can see over here in the background if we scroll down yup medications are these we can select between um these medications from the other screen if we would like to accept any of these are not as we can see these are the active medications so we can select those similarly there are certain diagnosis that we have the option to choose all the other information will be imported as default okay so its the other information that i really want i want it in their documents right so thats what i was trying to figure out so normally if im doing something i could hit print and just save it as a pdf hopefully and then put it in documents that way um yes that can be done that way as well uh as as a part of a document but uh the meaning of the c c da is actually to have this information against this particular patient in the same manner as you have uh your information added against this patient if you accept all of this information this will appear under the patients uh chart in in the clinical section this information will be um you know selectable for for you to you know refer to it back and forth its not gonna be like a document it will be like an interactive information that you normally enter yourself or for the patient and the clinical like you enter medications you enter diagnosis you enter vitals so this information will appear just like the way um the information that you have already for for the patient similarly this information will appear over there as well um if you choose to print this thats also a way to save the information but in that way uh in case if you would like to enter this information youll have to like manually type that or copy paste well normally when we get records from someone we just scan them in the documents and then they look so im kind of confused as to where this is going to actually show up you said oh no its its its not gonna be under the documents and its not gonna be within a document form okay it will be like uh you know a a same type of information that you already have in the system against the patient and it will appear under the ccd a uh section of the patient we can we can choose to exactly we can choose to accept that for now and lets see how it appears okay alright so were not gonna choose any medication on the screen or anything from that provider side correct simply gonna hit sign okay we have all these reports this medication these are current okay okay lets close this one i think its done can i go into this patients chart lets see if it appears somewhere there he is under cc there is one and this is that we this is what we imported yeah we can click on it to open it and it will appear just like this okay and we can reconcile that again if we want to okay so the way it so would it be there automatically or when you reconciled well its its its here by default the moment we accept it it will appear over here just like this okay and then we can you know reconcile if we want to accept any of the information from here into the chart we can do that okay by doing the reconcike okay so how did it get did we do something to make it appear under his chart instead of or does it automatically go there when his name is on it when its sent from another provider i think it comes over here automatically um probably we didnt do anything let me confirm that again from here we can check for another patient okay on this one yeah its its still coming up over here okay so we just have to remember okay but the best way is to just go under the home module and you will see ccda over there okay if you choose to accept any just do that if you dont just so do you always have to reconcile thing or no reconcile will import the information uh within the clinical section under medications just like for john frisbie yeah um mm you know usually we just ask patients when they get here about things like that so i dont know that we need to reconcile anything so you dont have to do that right uh if if this information is not useful then definitely um theres no need to do it i i see that the medications are away from the past these are some of the reports if i click on it let me see what comes up okay so its just telling us these are the current medications and diagnosis okay if we go under if we go under the clinical and medications say that once we put in because theres not um yeah exactly okay okay okay so i just need to look under the ccda  i didnt know to look there um yeah only for those patients for whom you have received one if there isnt any then um i mean theres no point in taking over there right and the best way to look for it is from the home module it will appear under the ccd a tracking you can also see from here the ones that you have reconciled the ones that you have sent out and the ones that are received okay so will it stay there under received uh will it will it will go under it will go under the patients um you know track and it will come up under reconcile unless you reconcile those they will appear under received the moment you reconcile them they will appear under reconciled okay so we did on freeze be already so we can see it right under under this particular you know section that we have reconciled that but we didnt do that for okay so for her if we wanted to move it from the received so we didnt see it and think it was new exactly just we would just reconcile and then yes that can be done from here and that can be done from the patients chart as well under clinical okay ill okay so now its still there yeah it is because we havent reconciled it yet and reconciliation involves the whole process where we choose to accept or reject any of the diagnosis or medications that are being sent along with this ccda so we just have to sign and after that and then exactly if we dont want it okay yeah reconciliation  in a sense itself means that if you want to see uh which ones are needed and the ones that are not just you know reject those okay okay so we can just sign it its not like it goes away it just doesnt go into and then do we have to hit report um yeah you you may and it will generate a report you can print it for your documentation for your record uh otherwise its not needed you can still you know go back into the same patient and look for it again okay so we can generate the same report we can generate the same report for john frisbie that we have already uh reconciled okay but on this if i dont want to print it i can just x out of it okay and click on ccda tracking over here again okay so good shes gone now okay okay alright um i wasnt able to give you much details on that because i myself is not sure a lot about this but in case if you have any questions or concerns you can always call us back again again unfortunately the other representative was on another line so thats okay we could help because i didnt know to look under the ccd a tracking i couldnt figure out how to make those documents pull up so no problem uh all of this information comes directly from the providers we are direct messaging that is the e messaging system uh with cure md and whenever there is a ccda detected under the e messages it automatically appears under the c c d a tracking and that is for sure okay okay okay thank you all right youre welcome donna have a good day bye you too bye"}}, {"id": 493, "data": {"call_id": "1622577135.1220698.txt", "text": "hello maribel speaking how can i help you hi maribel this is evan from curemd can i please talk to martinez hold

i'm gonna close this ticket bye bye"}}, {"id": 496, "data": {"call_id": "1622817736.129979.txt", "text": "thank you for calling the lmg cancer center the office of doctors ali and firestone they're located lmg cancer center janine hi janine this is colin calling from curemd how are you hey colin good how are you i'm good as well thank you so very much so uh two users britney and aaron are not able to use the oncology module so i'm calling out of that sure um and can i also i'll put in a ticket but can i verbally about another issue that we're having sure no problem i will be more than happy to assist you thanks for colin um our so there's a patient here um her name is sander swan and i can give you her account number to reference and i'll put it in the ticket as well um but she is here for um for her treatment one of her drugs is not crossing over correctly with those things um her account number is hold on one second it is 1157396 um and her name is sander swan just uh so we're clear um but the the medication cyclophosphamide um it's in there as 1000 mg to be given or dispensed but when so it's in here in curemd but then when it's crossing over to the nucleus the nucleus is telling us to pull 10 50 and we've never given that before it's always been 1000 so i'm not sure why it's you know it says it correctly in the computer but then when it's crossing over the nucleus it's not communicating correctly um i don't know if you guys can look at that on the back end and see if there's any issue connection wise or mhm uh i would have to check that because of the reason it should not be adjusting the dose like if it's 1000 mg it should dispense 1000 mg so i mean does the nucleus let you dispense 1000 mg or it does not let you dispense 1000 mg and instead it says to dispense 1050 let us let us pull 1000 we have to it will but it manually does it so we're just worried about there being an error made and how much we're pulling because one system is saying one thing and then you know that when we go to pull it it's saying a totally different thing so i don't want it cause it's cause it's room for error to make the mistake of getting more than is needed on ordered that's correct uh alright uh let me confirm this can i put you on a very brief hold please absolutely and you're in the oncology but you know now you know okay and she okay yeah the the okay i just wanna make sure that's what he was calling about i didn't he didn't tell me so i talked to from it and because i couldn't get it yesterday everybody else and he was like oh i'll do it like after i was on the back end okay nobody has to worry about it well he never said that he was doing it for everybody he was like i'll see if i can work it because it was and he never told he never like this message married tell me hey right now luckily there's people here that are like like good for a while and now it's like uh no i know that's why i was like if we pull more than terrible i'm like because that is great this is like my he's still not here i'm kinda like i'm wondering if cheaper dot i oh forget it the people eating are you like signaling that you're gonna hurt alright janine thank you so very much i was able to identify that uh since there is a change in bsa from 1.35 to 1.37 so do you do the rounding of rules it is taking it to the multiple of 50 that's the reason oh really even though it doesn't seem like that much of a change but but this is due to the running of rule in the practice okay so if we wanted to change it we need to um well but the the nucleus would spend the doors that you would you know it's just giving you a prompt that it did i mean the adjusted those should be 1000 and 50 mg instead of 1000 mg i know i guess the nucleus the nucleus is telling us that is what needs to be pulled that's correct and it's not and i mean that's not so i don't know hold on one second is it like a straight across the board okay he says yeah the team and due to our like percentage it falls in that category for 10 50 yeah from 1.35 to 1.37 or whatever into the percentage that we have it set up its it was within 5% or whatever it changes i guess it's rounding he said wow either way that's not okay hey colin so they are so the nurses are concerned um because what it's suggesting that we pull is still more than what she is supposed to be given so it's running up it's supposed to be 10 30 not 10 50 and they're wondering why and if if that's the change why in curemd is it not changed and but in the nucleus it is so why is it reflecting on both so that's yeah that's yeah i know are we are you know weight based doses are off you know they are on a percentage you know when we when the doses are changed but this is over that and they're not in both systems are not reflecting together they had supposed to have been i get that uh let me confirm that as well i'll be right back okay thanks frustrating somebody else should have been a point it does what we needed to do it does like we can tailor on call a lot more expensive and and then we'll be off of ecw which is actually beneficial 1st why they chose can be over like uncle mr because that would have been are increasing in our mr position mr because our referral basis i'm trying to help you neither alive unexpected support i mean you could have this l m g i help you out if you want because they were so helpful this morning and telling everybody that i need to use the google chrome somebody else no that's that's why yesterday i was like i haven't i have never oh my god the guy yesterday but we'll set you up for the phone and they were like if you hot from different computers that affects it too and i'm like everybody like everybody sometimes i mean we had a good street we didn't need him for a couple of months i take what i see it what's what's going on so hi janine thank you so very much for holding on the line and i apologize for such a long hold thank you uh yes i figured that out as well and i have escalated it to the uh back in department and they're investigating that and we will get back to you on that it should be the same in the curemd and then the uh nucleus as well that's correct all right i'll go i'll go ahead and send that ticket for you now sure no problem so uh britney and erin yes they are both they are both on it they did not they're not made aware to buy rip to use the google chrome instead of these tricks the internet explorer so they are both on the on college manager in the air able to use it all right i am glad that they are able to use the oncology manager so um uh should i close both the support tickets yes that's fine alright thank you so very much and i will be waiting for the ticket for this drug so that we can you know further investigate that and get back to you thanks for calling i appreciate it no problem it was my pleasure thank you janine  have a wonderful day bye you too bye"}}, {"id": 497, "data": {"call_id":

from vitality medical center hey charlie how are you hey im great i was calling because i have a question one of my providers she is in signing off on her note okay um and somehow she went through and signed them all but she didnt click review so theyre still showing up for her she didnt realize she needs to click review and then sign off are you talkin about the provider notes are you talking about the tasks the provider notes the actual note okay uh looks like a weird okay because normally when you do sign it and save it thats how its gonna stay that you cannot remove em unless you wanted to delete them right if you are still viewing them on the main page thats the task and thats the only way when you need to review it and save it so it can actually go away from there yeah lets go ahead and do uh any desk just to be just to make sure that we are on the same page and it looks like just confusion okay okay you ready for the number one sec 473 huh 524 okay 221 go ahead okay its waiting for you to accept please allow access and if you can please go ahead and show me the workflow okay so whats happening is we signed off on the note but its still showing that needs to be reviewed can you show me okay were gonna show you what were talking about thank you so so you can see this like how is this sign signed the status is signed uh one sec oh we have two screens can you see it uh yeah now i can see it so i do see the provider notes okay theyre all signed but i did not have that review button is there a way to let me so yeah see these these are tasks these are tasks not the provider notes yep there you go right so what were trying to figure out is because we have so many of these is there a way to mask without having to go into each one manually youre not no youre not gonna be able to do it all in one shot because thats how the system has been set up you have to make sure that theyre getting reviewed 1 by 1 like if you wanted to do it in one shot there is no option for that because this is basically a confirmation that providers going through and making sure that everything is good and if they just select all of them at one shot and thats it theres one provider that there needs to be updated and he accidentally reviewed and save it so that could be an issue in the future makes sense so where is it showing how do you see that exactly and these these are basically the tasks that they were assigned to you these are assigned to you kristy so anything thats gonna be in this page is basically got you assigned so you have to review em in order for them to go away from this page okay thank you okay alright any other questions or concerns um i cant remember your name but thats thats it okay awesome i think you guys have a wonderful day okay bye

is josh oh hi hi i'm just on a meeting with everyone alright what are you calling about uh you put in a ticket regarding patient notifications and the frequency oh yeah uh huh so would you like me to tell you now or to for a call back to tell me now okay so uh if you go into settings under practice then my practice settings you'll find an option for a device integration where at the bottom you'll see the settings it has um pra practice and then my practice settings okay appointment and then device integration under my practice settings why don't i see device integration it'll be under my practice settings you have to expand that as well oh expanded okay oh okay and the device integration you'll see where the text messages are what they're saying and the frequency of them like two days before one day before well ours says email oh here it is texts i got it i got it um two days before so that's it oh no yeah ours is only two days before that's it it does he's sending an s m s as soon as we schedule the appointment you have a new hit uh send text and uh you know schedule then yeah at that point it gives them in one text at the time of the scheduling it says send sms from scheduler that is yeah that's quick that's because whenever you go to the schedule in order to schedule an appointment you see an option to schedule and that will allow them to get a confirmation as soon as we make it right yup yup okay so this one says two days before the two days before the appointment is a trigger to go out that time okay um okay um so now if i wanted to also do the same day how do i do that hm uh you mean like uh you wanted to send like two of them instead of like only one that we're sending hm uh we don't actually have something for that we only have one text message that is sent so yeah we have just a frequency from here well what are all these follow up visit alerts and what is all this appointment those are the other ones so clinical reminders their whole entire thing lab result notifications if appointment what does that actually do confirm the appointment yeah well the status of the appointment if it's confirmed then it goes out today so you know when you schedule an appointment the status of the appointment is scheduled if you change it to the status to confirm then that's like a confirmed appointment and for a confirmed appointment it sends out one day before and what is it it's a notice it's a reminder mhm it's basically uh the same thing your appointment is confirmed and the other one is that the appointment is uh you have an appointment yeah so it's basically the same thing but a different statuses oh you just don't have the choice of the same day yeah we can do one day before two days before and not the day off okay so um are they confirming them when they get that first text do they have to confirm the patients you mean uh no it's uh just a reminder not a confirmation uh text basically it's just appointments in here there's no confirmed appointments once i confirmed confirmed confirmed appointment at the status of the appointment it could be a scheduled appointment or confirmed appointment or you know even it could be on the waiting list those are the different confirmed that cure md that's just us knowing it's confirmed well the patients would also know if that's what you're choosing to put in the uh you know text message but yeah basically that uh message under you know confirmed is sent out only when the status of the appointment is confirmed how does it get confirmed well if you wanna yeah we could if you could go on to the scheduler it would be easier to explain so if you go on uh say you're scheduling a new appointment for a test patient if you could try doing that now when you get to the page where uh you know you have to select the reason and the status you'll see that the status of the appointment is scheduled you can change that to confirm the waiting list so that's what the text message is for basically if you have an appointment which is scheduled they'll send out one of the text messages the other one would be confirmed someone would have to go back and confirm this when we're scheduling it we don't write confirm schedule right yeah so why would you ever go back and write confirmed and how would you do that you already scheduled the appointment you can't even get into this this was only for people who actually schedule and then later you know confirmed appointments you could always change the status to confirmed after you were done but this was only for manual has nothing to do with the tax okay forget that alright then that answers all my questions alright um anything else that you wanted to know no that was it thank you alright then you have a good day you too"}}, {"id": 501,

you let's say just be doing the clinical intakes and then having the provider sign it off so what will you be doing most so i i just want to make sure that i head in the right direction with this whatever documents uh so usually yeah you you do the notes and he signed them off okay so oh okay so it's more about the patient's clinical intake any history is anything than the provider signs off the note correct yeah okay i mean i can check let me double check with yeah definitely thank you i mean how how long is it gonna take because i need to get uh so the training itself maya usually last around 30 to an hour i'll try to speed it up as much that's the reason i asked rammy that what you will be doing specifically because if you let's say just taking the intake for the patients yeah and the doctor signing up the notes we can probably get this done earlier but regardless whichever scenario it is i just wanted to confirm so i can save your time as well i mean we don't change today can you finish next time i'm i'm sorry i didn't get that i mean if we don't cover the whole thing today can we finish another time uh are you saying to reschedule the training i mean if i what you say it's gonna take more than half an hour yeah just yeah letting you know so it could go up to half an hour maybe up to an hour if you don't that's something you can let rammy know so uh okay i'm okay with that that's completely alright so okay so what do i do uh i'm just waiting for rammy to come back i just wanted to know that if you just be signing the notes and creating them or will you just be doing the clinical intake no i'll be doing the whole what do you mean uh so for that it's so let's say if you're creating the provider notes yourself you know like when you check in the patients that's a different workflow that yes i will take you through but let's say if you're just putting in the clinical information like allergies or histories and then the doctor is signing off the notes and that's a different training uh process i will take you through so it depends because if i take you to the other there might be a lot of information that won't be any of good use for you so just want to save time and effort but uh yeah so i'm right here but uh as you mentioned you might be short in time is completely up to you so if you want to let's say in case if you're running short on time we can always continue this let's say the next available day on monday but that's something i'm just giving you an option because you said you might be short on time so yeah she will be allowed to sign up to sign the notes too bye so she she will be or she will not i will i will okay let's let's go full i am a doctor ok let's imagine this year this is bullshit mm i'm sorry i just put something not not a problem okay so without further ado i'll just go ahead and start with the training and if you have any questions maya please be uh make sure you can stop me and ask me at any time and since you're short on time i'll try my best to take this at a nice pace so without yes so without further ado as soon as you log in your dashboard home module your patient module and your schedule module now you can create a note either from today's patients which is a quick race wait a second do i need a pen and paper uh honestly maybe not it's only if it if you want to take down notes but uh mostly uh if you have any questions i can answer that it's up to you if you want to take notes yeah okay so uh as i was uh mentioning so when you log in you can create a note either from today's patients going into the patient or scheduler so let's kind of go into those right now so if i click on today's patients let's say right here okay so i have all these patients right here so you can see the the status right here they are checked in so for the ones that are checked in most of these notes are already made as you can see but one of these you can see that there is a create note option right here now that's in today's patients let's quickly go into the patient module and uh let's for example let's i'm just gonna pick up any patient right here provider notes this tab right here you click on provider notes just just kind of showing you and uh just a moment i think it's just loading up real quick okay there we go so we have the same add provider note option right here so today's patients patient module provider notes provider notes provider note addition right here the third place that we can go to create a provider note is through the scheduler and as you know any day pick out the patient you can create on the patient as soon as they're checked in so there will be an option so this is for today let me just show you okay just one moment let me find an available patient uh i'm sorry did you say something yeah what we are doing"}}, {"id": 510, "data": {"call_id": "1621973262.105822.txt", "text": "hello hello good afternoon linda this is brett from CureMD how are you

accessing the provider notes and we can look into the super bill uh actually currently that's where i kind of just hit a dead wall because uh i looked into the database and there's like this very important note for us that uh we just need a doctor pirzadas approval if you can just have him if you have a discussion with him whenever he's free and he actually just did and he said that we can keep my provider notes tab so i can get to the super bill i just can't read the provider notes which is fine so yeah i guess that problem solved itself no i personally i would love to help you more than this uh so if you can actually uh have doctor pirzada understand he's very busy but uh so i see that uh this is still in the pips state so you must be where with simon young the implementation specialist uh for the account yeah so if you can just have uh doctor pirzada send an email not even a call that hey can you kindly give currently provider note access or vice versa so that's just you

if you guys are not gonna bother us what we're gonna do then so uh you know the the ticket you have logged in uh it mentioned that there are two rejections you guys have been receiving one as for doctor hudas and others for doctor jane so first doctor who does rejection it's coming from medicaid i have seen all your claims previously that was those were submitted to medicaid those are not getting paid so i just wanted to confirm if you guys are credentials with medicaid or not yes we are because some of the medicaid they are telling us that okay maybe the you know the primary paid is the maximum and stuff but this one i've never seen this rejection so did we change anything on the tpi side or i don't know nothing has been changed everything looks same but uh let me just check one more thing real quick just stay with me because you know i did some research you know checked that you know if there is any changes anything has been made and you know check the older claims as well everything was same so let me just check that real quick one moment i think so i got it it's the taxonomy code that is causing this rejection let me just double check one moment i'm gonna verify the taxonomy code just bear with me yep the taxonomy is wrong let me put in the correct taxonomy sorry in medicaid group and i think that will be good to go now yep it's updated and you can resubmit the claim from medicaid and the claims that are being rejected for doctor james and the blue cross blue shield the reason for that that those claims for being uh those were submitted under individual npr because doctor jane i believe she has recently been added in the practice right yeah so she was not added into the billing group so yesterday someone from my team has already added her in the billing group so all of our claims are good to go out you can just simply go ahead and resubmit okay perfect thank you so you can submit medicaid and blue cross blue shield claims you know again and in case

substance i'm prescribing a controlled substance okay i sent it in for this patient last week and he called me and told me the pharmacy said that there was a problem so i sent it in again and i just saw him this week and he said the pharmacy said they were never able to prescribe it so i sent in a new prescription today and called the pharmacy to follow up and they said every time i'm sending the prescription it's closing the prescription okay i have no idea what that means or how that's happening because i can only send it one way and on my end it says right there it's prescribed okay uh you you said your name is judy correct yes okay judy let me just transfer you to our controlled substance team so that they can see what's the problem okay stay online awesome thank you mm mhm alright

you just fine thank you okay how are you i'm good thanks alright so uh rick told me you're having issues with the prescribing controlled substances yeah i sent this prescription in three times over the last week for this patient and i called the pharmist and they said yeah we can see where you spend each time and each time you send it you cancelled it you closed it they said we can't do on this one it's the way you're sending it well i only know one way to send it and i look at my software and it says they were all sent it doesn't say they were closed or anything else i don't know what the problem is and it's just this one patient alright uh would you be able to uh share your screen using anydesk so i can see what the issue is yeah let me get in there um okay my number is 983641095 alright i'm sending you the request now please accept alrighty alright perfect um let me see if i can play controls its i believe uh alright do you have a macbook so i can take control can you please

they said it was closed they can't fill them alright uh in the left side uh alright uh let me see if that one i believe i can uh in fact take control so let me okay let me see did you see your name here yeah i'm julie i'm sorry that's okay you knowrick said judy so i was looking for judy so i'm so sorry about that alright so i'm gonna search with the patient name uh see uh how many times you have tried to send this one yeah well i've seen it three times but they said each time it comes closed and you can see i send lots of prescriptions i haven't had this problem with any other patients so i'm not doing anything different on this one i don't know what the deal is alright and they they said that after you've sent it it it's cancelled automatically you cancel it from your end all the ones in uh may were sent closed or you know this sometimes happens when you send them back to back you know when you try to send it and then you try to send it again and again at the same time then it cancels the last one uh so that then you can see it wasn't at the same time the first and last time we were a week apart yeah so uh that that's something you know that that's why i was uh checking for the prescription for the patient but that doesn't seem to be the case here uh so let me see alright i believe that's your n a d n number i think so right um everything else uh looks uh right so what what i'll do is i'll go ahead and report this to our development team see if they find any issues from the back end and if there's no issues from the back and we'll see you know how we can proceed from there uh everything looks good from our end should be should be you know available at the pharmacy then so i said i sent it cancelled so i can't do it this way for some reason i cannot send a prescription for this patient to walgreens they will not accept it because it keeps coming closed alright um then there's one just before i go ahead and report this team i just need to confirm if this is in fact your correct n a d n number just to make sure that's not sure but i don't see why that would close it anyways um it shouldn't but uh you know uh when uh we report it go ahead yeah that's

ticket is submitted in a few minutes the the subject is training receptionist it's taking a while i'm sending it but it's taking a while why is it taking so long okay the ticket number is 379-0556 okay let me just see okay i'm putting you on speaker and what's her name can you please get her on the call pick up line okay the number is 309 the number for any this is 30 nine eight three 47 nine okay can you please accept mhm okay click on yes and allow the access as well okay so can you please open your cure md for me so that i can train you with the major areas of curemd okay so this is the home page for you which you will be using for that and there are certain things for that that i need to talk to you but so the first one is the messages that you see over here so we need use messages for two purposes uh one for the practice and one for the patient but right now you will be able to have the access to only send messages to practice so the thing is how will you be access like this messaging feature is like you have if you can send messages to one of your colleagues into the practice and they will be able to receive it on there curemd as well so it's really simple for that if you want to send a message or an email so you can use both of these features so for message you see this box so if you want to send it to the participant you just need to click on two and you have to select the name of the person to whom you want to send the message so you're gonna send this message to this person to select this person's name and the message can be sent to one or more than more than one person so once you get it selected you can attach a patient for that if it is required you can mention the subject uh the test and you can add any attachments from your computer as well and in the same way you can add anything and you can add the message into the message ability and after writing the message you can just click on send and the message will be sent to the relevant receivers cure m d log in okay any questions okay and the next one it will be if you want to like see your sent messages so you can click on send so this is the practice email option so you'll be able to see your sent messages over here the messages and the emails as well similarly in terms of draft you will be able to see that as well over here and the next thing we're gonna be covering is the tasks so the task will be like that that if you want us like go to like someone signs your task so it will come into your not started and let me just show you how it just looks like let's just create a test task priorities set to high and right now i'm resigning this to yourself as well so this will be assigned to you so this is how when a new task lands in the system will give you a prompt that you have one new task and this is how you're gonna see the task like some uh like the reception provider assign your task to uh send a medication or to review the note so it will be stated over here the title will be over here so as soon as you start working on it you just click on this task and if you have to change the status so the status like that it's not started if you want to send it to in progress you can click on in progress and click on save and from there you see it's vanished from not started and it will be landed into the in progress one and similarly if you wanna like you said if the task is complete you can click on the status and it's just set to complete and click on save so this will fall into your complete tests breakfast any questions i saw that there was there was an option to put complete and hide if you hide it it doesn't come up in any of yes yes it will it doesn't come up in any of these yes okay so the next part so this is the task part and these are the quick links at the top so this is how you gonna arrange them by going to my preferences and quick links so if you want like today's patients also with the uh quick links if you want to provide a note any quick links you want like you wanna see the faxes coming into your practice so you can drag and drop them and arrange them as per your choice as well so the next part is the patient model so this module allows you to search a patient based on the uh like what's the patient account number so this is a major in the first a search bar is for the name and if you want to do the advanced search these are the criteria you can search a patient from his first name last name account number or any date of birth any plan by plan so these are the various boxes from where you can search a patient okay and that's just to be more that would just be in the case exactly with the same name yes just to make sure like you can search with the date of birth or the account because the account number is unique for all the patients it's different for every patient so and similarly if you want to add any patient so you just click on this you're seeing this add option so this option is on the search criteria as well on this one as well you just click on add that's to add a new patient you can click on you can enter the these are all the mandatory items that are marked with the orange static so you have to just fill in these at the addresses the patient name first name last name their contact number and email address and ethnicity preferred languages and location zip code so these are all the uh the referral source from where they're coming so you just need to input all the information and click on save and the patient will be saved to your patients curemd data base okay any questions you wanna ask schedule mhm so if you if you want to schedule a patient like if there is a new patient into your practice and you wanna like he says like it's the first time he came to the practice and you want to like uh you just add it and you do wanna schedule it just click on save and schedule and it will take you to the scheduler page to schedule and schedule an appointment and this is how let me just open a test patient uh quick let me just show you the search workflow as well just to be sure see i'm just gonna search test patient so you see there are three test patients coming with the same name so i'm just gonna be opening this patient so this is the patient demographics actually uh this is this is having all the information the the personal information which is just fill into the patients while entering the patient's record and the second bar is for the insurance here you put in the add a new insurance for the patient and in the same way say this is the insurance part from where you'll be adding the new insurances and just just give me a moment alright uh sorry for the delay this is the part where you be adding the insurances so when you click on the add button so you can select the plan of the patient that uh which plan patient is using and you can edit the address and the policy number and the sign on the file so this is how you're gonna add the insurance to the patient and you just click on save and it will reflect into the patient's insurance okay okay and the next tab is for the contact so this this this contact is just for the emergency contact with the patient that if you're not able to talk to the patient on the given number so you can dial into any emergency contact number and you can add a contact number like click on this ad responsible party and when you click on it will add the new appointment add the new contact number for the patient okay okay yeah that's what's responsible party like if it's some other like who is responsible for the patients so you can add the numbers as well and the next is the contents part so this is the consent form so if you wanna add any hippa consent for that but i believe uh this is this will not be done by your side uh this this is an optional part so and so the last one is for the preferences so this is the patient based preferences you can add a default pharmacy as well into the patient's chart as well over here uh like this uh so like just clicking on this add option and you can select the pharmacy that is highlighted in blue the blue ones uh support erx like electronic prescription but the yellow ones as it says at the bottom that erx is not supported the yellow ones come up that that doesn't support electronic prescriptions they support paper prescriptions only okay so and you can set alerts there as well like which sort of alerts they should receive text or email for schedule appointment or confirm one so you can set the priorities as well from over here and after that doing that you can click on save and the settings will be saved any questions so far with the patient model all good yeah okay so the last part which will be covering right now is the scheduler part so this is the schedule this is the main you will be scheduling the patients daily so um let me just give you an idea like how you will be scheduling a patient so if you wanna schedule any patient for this lot you just need to click on the slot this is the open slot right now click over here and these are the patient so if you remember the account number you can search the patient or you can if you have recently opened the patient's account visit patients demographics you can click on hot list in the c uh just open to test uh just a few moments ago and it's showing up over here so you select this one and you select the reason that's the main part the main uh mandatory part for this so the reason should be the follow up of like forward to the patient is here like if it's a new patient for the first time so you can select the new patient reason and over here you can select the insurance as well as the patient is having any insurance over here so you can add the insurance plan over here as well and similarly you can change the duration of the patient as well the time of the appointment so when you click on this it will schedule the appointment when you click on schedule so let me just schedule real quick so you see this appointment has been scheduled so uh you must be wondering like why they're having different colors so the the reason for the different colors is that the statuses so you can see the status summary from over here and this will give you the idea what these colors actually mean so you see this one this is for the schedule appointment i've just schedule this appointment so it's in this color and the waiting list shows this orange and no shows in yellows and the confirmed in the greens once and the one that you're seeing right now these are the checked out appointments just checked in checked in once that have been not checked out so these are the various colors based upon to their status is okay and the next one will be like uh if you want to change the status of the appointment so from using this workflow when you left click onto the appointment you will click on check in and you can like the patient is here you time will automatically reflect if you want to enter any amount of copay if the patient is using the copay amount so you can click enter the amount and click on save and the patient will be checked in and similarly if you want to like change the status of the appointment so you can click on change status and like if you want to cancel the appointment right i'm just cancelling it so you can select it as confirmed as well or you can select as cancel and click on save this appointment will be cancelled from the providers dashboard okay any questions if you have okay and the thing is this is the weekly one uh this is the weekly view like if you want to view the weekly patients like weekly provider for a weekly view for some provider so you can do that from over here from this weekly view you can select the location then you can do that following this workflow and similarly these are the multiple calendar this is the multiple view like if you're having one or more provided into your practice you can select the location and you can view the calendar side by side like selecting a location selecting this provider and over here you can select the same location and you can select the provider like this okay and you can save this view and moreover you can add more than five of the columns over here so this let me just show you how you can do that as well so if you want to save this view of yours you can save by clicking on the save option over here and if you want to change the number of columns over here you just need to go to your homepage and go to general and you see uh over here the schedule of multiple views should be five of the column so you can select it to four or five as per your choice okay any questions so far to the scheduler module if you have okay so you see these are the five light right now the the columns are set to five so you can select to five and four as well as well okay and similarly if you want to open any patients documents so like you can go to the demographics and if you want to upgrade anything into the chart so this is how you're going to access their documents by clicking on this document folder and over here you will be able to upload and add new things in any file into the by clicking on this upload and you will be able to do that okay okay so any more questions you have so that if i scan something in the email that i do that directly on the screen um yes actually you can do this directly if you scan something you can select the item and you can click on the email and we'll be able to a relevant person if you want to okay you can scan from over here as well and you can scan from this advice selecting the folder if you scan from over here you can just drag and drop into the folder okay and then if and then how do you do it from here if you wanna do the scan from here you just need to click on this on some certain for like for this insurance this will open this and you can click on file and you can click on upload or you can click on scan if you want to scan it so this is how you're gonna do that and it will be uploaded into this folder okay okay and any questions you have okay so we are all done with the overview of different training so if you have any further questions you can give us a call or you can log a support ticket for that if you have any queries we'll be happy to help you out alright alright thank you so much take care have a good day bye bye bye"}}, {"id": 538, "data": {"call_id": "1623160458.136391.txt", "text": "welcome to the prime health medical group if you are a doctor how may i help you hi this is rick from cure md

"1622662590.12551.txt", "text": "hello this is joe doctor khan office how can i help you hello this is ben fisher calling from curemd am i speaking with joseph freeman that is correct alright uh just received this request from you saying that you wanted to have an additional resource added to the system and the scheduler yes and uh uh you wanted to know so uh there there are no charges for adding a new resource there is no problem you can go ahead and add the resource and you can have a schedule created but i was reading your concern but you mentioned that you are gonna be uh using that schedule for the staff members so what exactly are you looking to document their um things like time off um that way it's a quick reference for everybody in the office um because everybody in the office uses the mr and they're constantly looking at the schedule um we might as well put things on there like uh things that don't necessarily involve doctor khan but do affect the practice so say if the receptionist is out um or they request vacation in advance we would put that on that side of the schedule and it would pertain to that same day right it wouldn't be kind of muddied in uh into doctor khan schedule does that make sense uh well uh i mean if if you wanna like not the only thing so it could be like you know we have to call this patient um or you know say someone in the office uh promised to call a certain patient on a certain day whenever they had more information you know that would that would be a place that they could put a reminder to call that particular patient let's see what else i mean i understand there's there's other reasons that there's other things you can put on there too i understand you're actually trying to use this for internal use for the practice however uh you know even if you add a resource uh similarly you know like a provider that's going to be a calendar on which you would be able to schedule or add the information for that particular patient if only the users are added also as the patient only then they will be able to document it over there but you know let's say if you say that you would like to uh documents and information for particular user that's not possible because the users information does not populate onto a calendar unless the user is also added as the patient into the system that's understandable that's understandable we would i mean my original idea was simply to use the test patient and then in the comment section right what would need to be done does that make sense or write what alright so so there is x information i understand there was something else you know there are the things which you can use i can then i can think of right now for two things uh which which you can start using in this matter a let's say if there are tasks which are to be created let's say you know if a patient has to be contacted in to to your 22 months time or you know in a week's time or something so what what can you know either the provider can do that or whoever however you wanna start off with this workflow somebody at the practice can assign a task to another user and that will go into their bucket of task and everybody the way you look at your emails can look at their uh tasks and they can just you know work on their task they can also put in the comments they can put in in progress they can the task can be assigned from one user to another user as well and so on so forth secondly the option for messages you know you can send in the messages internally you can use that already and we use that system that system already but i was referring to something that we we seem to be having an issue with is simply you know um if people are out there's not one consolidated schedule that has that information you know um ex staff member is out until 12 p.m. you know that way people if if it's in a if it's in one singular spot that everybody looks at all the time then everybody will understand that okay i can't be out on that day till 12 you know does that make sense well i that's gonna be difficult i guess for your guys but if you think you guys can keep up with that one so that's that's up to you but uh how is each user so if you're gonna use a test patient how is uh you know one user would know that this this information is for you know which user or person yeah so you write it in the comment section you know you use a test patient for an example you know you can create a 15 minute time slot for the test patient but in the comment section of their visit you write the pertinent information that you need to share with the rest of the team right so let's say doctor khan on vacation um this is a bad example because if doctor is on vacation then his entire schedule would be blacked out you wouldn't be able to schedule anything right but if it's for staff member no one else is gonna know that except for maybe the administration or doctor himself and no one else knows that so that whenever they they they don't people won't think in advance to you know uh you know compensate for that person being out does that make sense well if if you're uh for your concern uh for now i cannot think of anything else besides task and messages which can help you in this matter so what what what i can do for you is i can assist you adding a new uh resource and add a calendar for that and you can you know start using it and let's see uh you know how it goes if if you guys think you're comfortable you know what that's going to be ok because looking back on it i have a paper copy here with that i'm that i'm making as a master schedule and maybe once i finish it if i decide that we'll still need a resource then i'll reach back out that sounds like a deal

say look up any of these let me find who i was looking for earlier okay and we'll go all the way back to january alright so i'm specifically asking just for this physicians um information okay um for the month and when i pull it up and tells me there's been one patient referred which is incorrect um when i go and i dropped down and instead of doing a referral i do by demographics and then all of a sudden it changes um for the same physician more uh m a r r i s same timeframe january by referring in print and now i have uh well yes three patients instead of just the one can you tell me why it's pulling different reports um because this is very troubling to me because when we when we wanna look and see what we've gotten from certain doctors we always go by um you know these reports and when i'm getting two separate information uh you know i i don't like to see that contradiction alright let me go ahead and make note of these patients account number and then see why there might be discrepancy because i see that it's the same reference provider but the source being selected is different so what exactly do these you know why is one pulling under referral and one under demographic right give fishing 24919 referring provider sos and then the demographic is giving up three now what i am saying is this referral source being under none here is the reason why he's showing up on the one so this patient was not entered with a referral source now let me go ahead and investigate this at my and get back to you okay would that be okay yes please please thank you so much"}}, {"id":

luxury narrow simon it's uh n a r a s i m as in mary agent that's the last name the first name is l a k s h i'm sorry l a k s h m i perfect how is clouding cure md m d cloud 18 and uh the name of your

on hold on line doctor are you there yeah okay so does the doctor what exactly was your concern again no my thing is you know i've got the secure md avillon and put the you know date of service and all that and everything you know billing but it asked for admission date where can i put the admission dates okay so it's asking for an admission date to put an admission date no no see see the the problem is most of the insurance companies want the date of admission okay uh so uh the insurance company they want the date of uh admission admission yeah when do i put that in curemd okay let me uh let me just ask that just give me one moment thank you for staying on hold doctor are you there yeah yeah so uh doctor are you specifically i mean uh is a concern is the insurance company asked for the date of service or date of admission no they want both they want both alright so uh let me ask again thank you for staying on hold doctor are you there yeah okay alright so if uh i've asked around and uh now in that particular field uh is that a mandatory field like would it not let you proceed if you don't uh fill it in no no it's it's not there but the company because they need that admission understand yes because i've asked i've asked from the other uh team member and basically what they've said is that you know that particular uh it's it's uh it's there so that you know if in case if a patient comes in an inpatient if they stay over and so uh for that particular reason they have that date but uh in your case uh do you uh uh was it an inpatient like uh where they admitted yeah in patients yeah okay i see okay alright uh well in that case uh i think it's better if i just uh transfer you over to yeah what i could do is i could cheat the system like you know when it comes to the address you know i can book in paris athens paris uh you know in brackets i can put the date of admission in the address it says 24 whatever uh you know greenware lane right i think uh in that i can put a paris and you know right i see okay well i think that's the best way i can do this is that uh i'm not the uh special for this one uh let's give me one second i'm gonna ask for that okay thank you for staying on hold okay doctor so uh yeah so regarding uh the uh the date of admission now you're saying that it's an inpatient correct yeah so so you know what date uh the patient came in or is patient so i mean like wouldn't that just resolve it i mean if you added that date yeah we actually had the data and uh where should you add it on the avallone that that's your question yes how do i add that date of admission see date of service is there okay see date of service is there okay but date of admission is not there okay so all right so you're not going to find that right okay so you're not able to see that okay uh alright let me have my uh last month of my team members let's see if uh even knows over here okay doctor so uh where exactly are you trying to add the date of admission like which page are you on right now no wait uh 1 2nd i don't see any field for that uh you you can't see it where where would i have to look at it you know where would you let me let me see see if i go to the profile there's a add provider info and then it has a other add other info and that's the reason and all that but nowhere is there a date of admission you know i have a date of service so you can't see you just can't see the date of admission over there yeah i see okay just give me one moment let me relay the message i'm talking about the ipad mini yes uh that's where the avellon app works um so i'm just uh discussing this with my team so as soon as i get a resolution i'll let you know doctor thank you so much for patiently staying on the line here okay so uh uh doctor what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna be transferring you over to uh one of my colleagues uh he's a specialist at this so we're gonna try and solve this all this together okay okay thank you hey this is josh at curemd how are you doing yeah good sir i have a quick question i don't see a entry for you know uh i'm trying to uh you know uh what's that uh uh kind of uh uh integrate the office and the hospital thing you know so that i can do the charges of the hospital on avellon but there's no you know usually some insurance companies they require the date of admission that is not available here and date of admission where exactly you're talking about you're talking about the charges section in curemd where you see that yeah yeah alright let me let me just get a full because i actually wanted like a full idea about which exact section you were talking about to determine if it's actually available in avalon so uh because if you go into for example just imagine you're i don't think it's available um okay but i'm in the patient's thank you mhm as they create super bowl see there's date and time that's the date of service and then provider location diagnosis procedures total maybe comments comments i can put it in you can put it in the comments but if you're talking about you know creating a super bill then even in you know if you open it up in a computer you have the encounter date but uh you don't have the admission date there either yeah but uh usually when we uh buill the insurance companies it requires that the date of uh you know the information but yeah i guess yeah we don't have two things on our like our template i guess so yeah but i can put it on the comments right okay definitely yeah you can definitely put in the comments comments and then uh it'll be visible right it will be uh yeah going forward in the office in curemd yeah it'll be visible alright i thought of another thing you know the telephone number is 10 digits right the date of birth is what uh two plus uh 24 plus i can put four zeros followed by the date of birth you know what i'm saying yeah i don't want to put it on social security number you know because i had to come after me yeah the social security uh definitely not put on there no no no what i'm saying is in that section i can put it in the telephone section or the comments thanks for the comments would be best okay thanks no problem

i have checked the status log um and it was uh because the reason that the confirmed messages uh i mean all kinds of messages are not set up for saturdays and sundays i just noticed in the rings i have rescheduled and appointments saturdays and sundays oh you mean wait a second so we we're on the schedule but what about monday i thought it was two days in advance and then one day in advance so it should mhm the appointment was scheduled for monday right so the no the the appointment was scheduled for tuesday and you just scheduled another appointment for wednesday and i got a text message um but i have i still have not received a an email but i did get a text message the text message that you got that is the one that is for for scheduled appointments that's working okay uh the appointment was scheduled for tuesday that you're right and okay so the status of this appointment that we schedule the other day was still on schedule so we had to check that it is uh it should have a confirmed status for you to send a message 24 hours before the appointment what what what i'm sorry what um are are you on the 25th of may uh calendar for jessica yeah right so if you see it the appointment it is showing the status of the appointment as confirmed that i just did i did it like 10 15 minutes ago i was looking in your file so it was having a scheduled appointment status uh well you did that yeah right you turned it green i turned it green so once it's green that that's the point when when when it sends out the the message now the appointment that i scheduled hold on hold on hold on this makes no sense no sense whatsoever so you're asking me to confirm the appointments that haven't been confirmed in order to send out a confirmation or reminder is that what you're saying that is correct well that doesn't happen at flat iron why do i have to do that i mean these appointments have not been confirmed so why are we confirming them if if if the appointments are not confirmed mindy we need not to send the confirmation messages as well well no no no no i want the messages to go out as reminders not as confirmation who's gonna i mean the confirmed once we schedule the appointment we're kind of like assume that it's confirmed because they scheduled an apointment the the only thing is that uh it's always good to send out a schedule appointments on the patient asked for the appointment so you you kind of assume that it's confirmed it's just that reminders needs to go out the reminders are all set that they're going out no they're not going out there not going out there not going on alyssa patient is confirmed and the patient isn't confirmed because they're confirmed when they there there uh okay if i i'm like so lost here you mean to tell me at flat at flat iron they all their patients are confirmed they when they schedule the appointment they make them confirm patients i don't think so i don't think that's happening it's flat that's right that's how your your practice workflow is i absolutely understand and let's not talk about the confirmed messages let's just talk about the reminder messages that you want the patient to get the reminder messages now if you go in your text uh status log the reminder messages mindy are going the way you just received a message the one that i scheduled okay so you just need to let me know if you need those reminders to be one day okay hold hold on hold on hold on you're wrong that is not happening i okay i scheduled this appointment for tomorrow last week number one never received a conference received a text when the appointment was scheduled that was fine i never received a message two days before never received a message a day before until you changed it to a confirmation status that is when okay so none of these other legitimate patients all 22 of these patients have been sent reminders none of them have show me how they have on your your screen because i i i was a test nation patient and i did not receive a confirmation nor i i did not receive a reminder you are right you are right let's put it down could you please give me your anydesk number so we could get on one screen okay hold on no i can't until i i have to log off in order to do that hold on okay it's (837) 037 426 837047 what was no no 837037426 thank you hold on i have to log back on did you are you there i can see your screen i know you can see that okay mindy now uh before before we get into the uh text message status log one quick thing you're a good communicator you you've made me understand what you actually wanted to communicate now at my end uh i will try hard to uh put it in a way that you that you understand the way i understood what you said now if you go into text uh messages give me one moment here now we're we're just talking about the appointment that we had on tuesday the one that we scheduled on friday for tuesday you should have had received a message two days prior that was sunday and then one day prior that was monday and you have not received today today yes so yesterday and today you should have received two messages and you have not received either one of them right well no that's not true about 10 minutes ago i received a text message after you changed that conference you change that appointment to green i received a text message now also i received another text message because apparently you created another test on the 26th and i received a confirmation for that but not a reminder okay so recently well i wouldn't receive just now you've received two messages one for the confirmation uh when i changed it to green and the other one for the new appointment that i scheduled for wednesday is that correct that is correct right um now the reason why you have not received the message that you should have received on sunday right that's one message that you have not received is right because down here now this is one of the settings i just lost control i just lost control on the screen i see you i see you um so there's a not responsive let me send you the request again thank you okay down here now this is when the text messages are sent right so over here saturday and sunday are not checked so the right the message that we have not received on sunday which we should have received is not received because this should all be checked right one the message that we should have received on sunday is not received because of this reason the message that we should have received on monday that you received when i change the status to green is because we did not turn it to green on uh friday when we schedule it when it was not confirmed we don't you normally do not do it you normally do not do that right now so what we would do is now looking at these two messages scheduled appointment and confirmed appointments so the this second message is what we do not do normally we do not change status so what we would do is that one message is gonna go to the patient when you schedule it and you hit schedule send message the second message would go which would be a schedule appointment reminder message as per your requirement if you could please guide me now this one is not for us right this is the one that we because we do not follow that workflow in our normal routine so we would not be using this confirmed appointment message right so we can even uncheck it if we want to now this is the one schedule appointment message that would be sent out as a reminder now please tell me when do you want it to go one message is gonna go as soon as you hit send and schedule s m s right that's the other one is gonna go once uh as per how we how we set it up here right so if you want the reminder to be sent one day before two days before whatever you can set it over here and we can save it it's gonna go like this okay there's just one other thing mhm you said that it wasn't checked off for saturday or sunday we have patients on wednesdays and fridays mhm and they so there so the two day message wasn't going out then either that could be that could be a configuration uh researching i mean right now what has happened is that the configuration for messages is all being checked and refreshed so there might be something in there which is now not there so it's all set for now and once we set it up save it it's gonna go the way you want it to be from this point onwards so there there could be a problem in the in the past that's that's there okay so okay so right so what you're saying is that we are kind of starting from scratch here and no reminders have ever ever been going out since september of 2020 is that correct is that my understanding and now going forward that is that what you're saying just trying to understand okay so so right now since we're not sending out since we don't do confirmation only one reminder is gonna be going out is that correct true okay so let's make it a day before so if you could mindy please uh save this what we have the changes that we've made okay this is how it's gonna be and for for have you hit the button okay got it so it's now one day before the other one is checked out all days are there nine a.m. to seven p.m. after 30 minutes wonderful all right now let's go back and see uh ah that mm from from when were the schedule because they confirmed messages are not going so scheduled messages are going out the scheduled messages ah the first one is going out yes i know that the first one is going out and the 2nd 1 yes you see the confirmed messages that's right we know that that because you changed to confirm you just told me yes okay so scheduled appointment messages are going out let's let's just hit um uh the month of november in 2020 i'm sorry 20 because we we just discussed that probably from august 2000 and 20 no schedule messages are going out i just wanted to have that that's the reason i want to check november that if there are messages been going out in the month of november or not starting one november okay i'm putting you on speaker okay sure go ahead so this is now the month of november for the last year only for the schedule appointment so we have almost let's see we have 88 messages that went went out in the month of november 2020 oh that's fine but that is so that they're all the messages that went out i know that they went out when they stole the appointment they met went out we know this that was that that was never the issue the issue were was the reminders reminders have never gone out the uh mindy please have a look at this screen i mean this message and this message are being sent to the same uh the recipient right one was sent on uh the but but it says scheduled appointments it doesn't say i thought it would say confirm message or reminder message we can change text over there i mean if you want to know it doesn't matter no i don't care what the messages say all i want to know is that it's working and it hasn't been working and all i want to know is that we i don't i don't really care i've been told in the past that no miss no confirmation messages have been sent out since last august and i and and that's fine and i have no confirmation messages have been sent out like i said this afternoon and i called every single patient to remind them on the schedule for tomorrow so i know it hasn't been working i just wanna make it start working and if you're saying that it'll start working now and that the people that are on the schedule for wednesday because there are patients on the schedule for wednesday will be getting reminders tomorrow let's check tomorrow and make sure that that's true that's all thsts correct that is correct okay okay so do you past is the past it doesn't matter the past is the past what's important is that going forward people should be getting and and i'm gonna put myself on the schedule again for wednesday and see if i get without you confirming it okay alright perfect mindy i'm gonna be giving you a call tomorrow to confirm before i go ahead and close the ticket alright yeah okay i'm gonna pull this appointment for tomorrow and you're creating an appointment for tomorrow under doctor five um okay so i should be getting a reminder for the message tomorrow is that correct that is correct for wednesday okay so let's let's just wait no that's incorrect you've already confirmed this message so that is not correct so we know that it works but we don't use that so now hold on one second alright so it's not only doctor five this is going for all providers that are in the network is that correct correct okay so at 12:45 i'm going to schedule another test on okay so i just scheduled hold on this is wait now i'm going to cancel this appointment okay so i just got hold on okay i just got a confirmation for that this is interesting i just got a a confirmation and it's the appointments with doctor crystal tope doctor jessica fied they're both mentioned in this confirmation message why is that you you've you've uh i made an appointment only for doctor jessica or you've done it no this is under this is under crystal toe not but but crystal is a resource under five is that why it's going out saying that that could be the reason yes so is there any way of changing that well we can change the flag in the text message if you need to you can change the what uh the flag that is uh added in the text message because i mean it's i don't know how you guys work because she crystal is a resource under five but the but i find that very very confused it's gonna be it's gonna be both names in the text message in that case it has to be okay alright okay well let's let's see what happens okay let's talk tomorrow again yes but tomorrow is a very busy day for us but uh okay let's talk let's talk tomorrow okay sure mindy okay great i'll speak to you tomorrow if there's any good time that you know off for now uh for tomorrow

the settings if you click on that for me carly thank you and then you click on downloads go to the menu of downloads uh yeah so if you click on those three uh dot on the top right corner right underneath the cross option uh and you click on that then you click on downloads which is the fourth option uh on the drop down menu this will take you to a screen carly for your downloads do you see anydesk on the top of the download list no you don't okay uh would you mind get anydesk for windows and then you says download now okay perfect uh carly would you mind kindly going back to the anydesk website and where it says thank you for downloading anydesk do you see a download now option where it says if the download does not start automatically please click the download link below do you see that by any chance hold on thank you is it the remote control desktop free the website or download which one is it not a problem so uh it's anydesk definitely and when you click on the download now option right on the screen and then it gives you this thank you for downloading anydesk uh if you can just click okay yeah if you wouldn't mind just clicking the download now option one more time maybe it didn't work the first time if you do it this time yeah you'll get something that's downloading on the browser itself do you see that by any chance i don't really you click the download option so okay i i do i do understand so right now you might be seeing the same thing i'm seeing that get started with anydesk in three steps with the images yes and there's a download now option right about that do you see that by any chance it just says download now yeah absolutely uh you keep clicking i have like five things open really okay it's uh so it's now not downloading it all you want to download and there's nothing for any any windows download open okay and you don't see anydesk anywhere no okay uh would you mind going to your uh download folder if you have if you click on let's say my computer your computer itself uh on the left side you'll see a download option or a download folder uh i just want to see because you did it a few times and it probably did download it where did you want me to look mhm so uh carly if you let her know so i'm trying to get the system going i'm so new i really don't know you know you can be all right that's why i'm here to help carly whenever so uh just so that's pretty great so anydesk will really help you in the future too if you ever log in a ticket we always use anydesk so this is pretty great on setting you up with this and no problem i'll figure this out why you're not able to find it and we'll definitely get this started for you i will do for you carly how about this i think that might be much easier for both of us so i'll try so are you using the just a moment i see an email over here i'm gonna try forwarding this app over to you via email uh just to make sure that you're able to get it okay okay i'm just gonna upload this right here carly and perfect awesome okay just give me one moment carly i just wanna confirm one thing and before just sending this out okay just another moment i'm just waiting for the system to respond i'm just accessing the file and uploading it through the email and awesome so yes carly the email that is best to reach you at is that the one with your first name carly at doctor bradley wiserman perfect amazing thank you for confirming that bit and anydesk okay perfect uh thank you so much for your patience currently i have just sent that email over to okay undelivered message why would that even be uh software you're i received the email you did okay awesome uh okay so if you open that up do you see and uh anything attached to that probably it would be in anydesk uh software application says attachment included with this email message it just says you should not files from yeah no no you're good it's actually uh just the email thing like whenever you attach something it just gives you this kind of you know be aware kind of thing there's something attached with it uh that's that's okay so uh okay one moment because you did click the download now option uh i have 100% believe it's in your computer somewhere right now because it did download i'm because this would be downloaded okay so let's take this step by step let's try to see if we can find it over here so uh so let's say if you click on your windows option currently for me on your keyboard so you see the windows option at the bottom left next to the space bar mhm yeah so if you click that uh do you see like a little text box option that you get in which you can like type something so if you right yes if you write anydesk a n y d esk uh can you let me know if you do see anything pulled up when you write that up awesome so do you see this little uh red box kind of icon with like awesome uh would you mind clicking that for me it says yes it says more info i think this might be the yeah yeah if you wouldn't mind running that i think we're we're definitely on track right here so yeah uh if you wouldn't mind just like following through with the application asks you to continue next installed that kind of stuff and uh when you're done uh the application will open up um just let me know if that happens and whenever that does okay it just has remote desk on this desk okay one second one

via telehealth if you have reached the marri ann young mind how can i help you hi my name is harry sanders from cure m d and i think i just missed a call from jessica so is there any way you can connect me with her uh yes let me put you on hold and see where she is sure hello hello harry good morning jessica how are you good morning good can you hold on for 1 second for me sure thank you hello yes hey how are you i'm very good how about yourself i'm good you probably had a very busy day yesterday i did okay so i have a ticket in which you have asked two questions i did so is there any way we can do a screen share sessions so i can walk you through yeah any desk yes please 318 376 728 728 okay okay so let's skip the first question the second question is is there a way to open up a little bit hold on 1 second sure okay hello can you hear me now yes so the second question was is there a way to open up a previous note in a tab or window while tapping anyone so let's assume we are inside a test patient okay test andy and you are in this note and you want to open up a new window so you can open up a previous note so you click on your name okay and you click on new window and if there is another note you can definitely go inside that note so that's the only way to do it you can't like click it and open like a little no that is okay okay and and then the other one was to see if she pre populate the same thing each time for the assessment let's yeah let me show you what she means actually sure um let me go to one of these patients really quick so she is talking about this plan follow up here like it doesn't repopulate each time and she has to retype this is there any way to make sure that saves for each one and i checked yesterday because this is not a component and this is a custom form that's why okay not moving forward to them so it's because she's free typing is that what you're saying that is correct if it was like a component then it would have moved on to the other note okay let me look at that really quick sure and see if there's something that we could do to fix that why does it hate me provider note what internet service provider do you have uh we have comcast oh would i choose a blank one i mean to do that just wait slow today i'm assuming it has something to do with the com xfinity okay okay see all other information is populating from the previous notes right this is a custom form if you click on it it says right here custom forms so that is the reason it's not populating automatically so i see that on here is there a way to free type something in there that it populates each time where is there something that we could add right after the plan follow up to that would populate each time after the plan follow up because this is what they do is they'll they'll go in here and then they'll click you know whatnot that's right and then yeah and then i'll accept it and then down here they'll free type like what they change like changed zoloft increased zoloft 50 mg and all that and whatnot so they want to keep that that same one thing in there is there a way to like make another one of these that they can just free type that would happen that would do the same thing each time so they don't need to go back in each time so if they free type it will not populate on to the next note mhm but there is one way where let me check so let's say you have created this note okay mhm and can you just type in anything next to it so i can show you how that works decreased literal program anxiety okay and hit save perfect so let's say the patient came in last week and this is the note from last week okay okay so we're gonna go ahead and create a provider note mhm and this time we will choose the note template as blank okay and we will select follow up this is just one of the work flows okay okay this is a completely blank note so what i will do is i will click on import from prior note and this was the previous one and i hit import and now the note template is back to the follow up and everything is populating and even the free text is populating as well so this is one of the workflows okay does this is help i believe so i'll see if they're okay with this if if we want to try doing it a different way i'll give you a heads up and let you know no problem jessica so i can go ahead and close this ticket you can thank you so much enjoy the rest of your day thank you you too bye bye bye"}}, {"id": 579, "data": {"call_id": "1622653919.1250405.txt", "text": "hoping haling center this is taylor how can i help you hey taylor

i'm good how's everything today how are you i'm doing well as well thank you um no i don't know it was it's kind of in a hot mess i am not gonna lie well i think people there's a problem is that people don't know that i switched to something new and so there's a lot of confusion so then there's a lot of time or people then miss the appointment time and then i can't get them scheduled during anyways so i think it'll be good to send this out because that will be helpful and then also oh while i have you on here yeah ofcourse for a couple of things um okay so just i prescribe something and then but it's the wrong medicine how do i cancel a prescription cancelling a prescription okay let me walk you through workflow for that okay okay do you need to get on my desk ah yes just tell me any desk okay 560 512692 okay i got to your screen so this is the medicine right here that i have you sent out this prescription or it's still not sent out uh i already sent it out okay uh could you uh i don't think i have controls these uh might have to direct you in the process jessica okay could you just uh cross out from here alright and go to your home the dashboard alright can you go to a new erx activity okay could you open this prescription uh could you close is it this okay that option is not popping uh could you give me a moment let me have a look at this at my side sure in the meantime uh let me show you the process of sending out the emails and text alerts for your patients first let me show you the text that i've created so could you go to settings on the top right um could you expand practice my practice settings expand that as well and device integration can you scroll all the way to go all the way down please uh i think it's just loading yeah okay do you see the very last patient search report where it says patient portal mhm could you click on the message icon oh this yeah this alright this is the text that we send out to all your patients with the patient's name and the practice name mentioned over here at the same time this is the message that you want to send out we're not at liberty to send out uh text uh without any approval that's why i mentioned that uh they have been created but not sent out so if this is okay then i can just go ahead and this is for the for telemedicine it's just a template yeah a template the template name won't pop up inside the message okay and also let me show you the letter template that we have would you scroll up on the left um you know could you just scroll down on the left can you see reports at the very last on the left side mhm okay could you expand that and click on letter templates so the first one the very first one email text communications that's the email that will be sent out to all the patients you can just scroll down and have a look at the message do you want to mention the patient name or anything else in this or is this okay yeah maybe we should do the patient name okay let me add that do you want me to add it um yeah i can show you how that's okay i already know how to do it that's good and then okay you've got a pretty good hang of cure m d yeah i just like i kinda get it um ikay alright okay now let me show you how to send these messages out could you scroll all the way to the top click on report the second last icon that you see um no i believe uh no uh just scroll all the way next to settings on the very top the second last reports yeah this no no next to settings you will write on the settings module this is the dashboard so next to setting that's reports yeah this one okay got you alright and from the left hand side okay okay you don't have permissions let me just give you permissions real quick okay could you refresh this page i mean go back to a different module come back to reports okay now you can see patients on the left tree menu could you expand patient and then go to search i think that's the fourth last button alright okay so this is a test that i created uh let me just show you how to do a new one so in order to send out it's a bit of a a bit of a long process i know but um since it's going to be a one time thing it's not used quite regularly that's why you have to follow this procedure so in order to send out a text alerts what you can do is just click on new okay uh just give it a name probably telehealth text alert and at the bottom so these are all the criterias that you can select from so this will filter out all the patients that you need to send out the email communication okay so um let me just show you so what usually we do to send out a text alert is yeah you can see status over here on the profile you see at the very last row status yeah just mark it as active so all patients are active inside curemd will be filtered out okay okay and just at the top just click on search so these are all the patients inside curemd that are uh gotcha filtered out and active as well so just click on the check box next to patient yes go to send this is where you can send sms or an email and yeah this is the message that the patient will receive all you introduce click on i accept and click on send text and this is the message that will be sent out to all the patients okay similarly you can also send out the email as well okay so there are 500 participations and all of them will also receive an email cool okay so yeah just to test it out we should have done one thing we should have added your email as well just to see if you're receiving them i think i'm a test patient so um is your email entered in one of the patients let me have a look yeah no it's not like honest yeah i'm like the cure md test patient let me have a look so your email is under jack sparrow yeah i'm i'm also under cure md test i think jessica email takes a bit of time to reach but uh let me show you where all your text messages fall in so you can check over there so on the very top could you go to dashboard again please and uh could you scroll down on the left side do you see administration um-hum click on administration please and uh the third last team status log so all your text messages have been sent to these patients okay so okay so this is how um i can tell if somebody's like i didn't get a text reminder and that's set up too right the text reminder i think i just thought that we were in somewhere text reminder are set up but those are generally used for in office visits all the text reminders um okay well maybe i created my own then maybe thanks where how would you go to i think i created my own text reminder for evite for telehealth how would i have done that i would have gone to here um jessica could you hold on for a second i'm just checking one thing practice oh reminders and confirmation that's what i did okay um jessica you were saying i'm sorry about that that's okay that's alright um i was saying i i set up an appointment reminder for telehealth do you see this i mean i think i did it right mhm okay so let me ask you this why does it so this is what i did is this right so telehealth reminders will go automatically to the patients jessica i don't think you need to create a reminder yeah because they don't know i mean i don't think they know what is going on i just think the more information is better like my clients like i mean yeah i got the thing that said that to collect a novel health but i don't like i don't know what that is i mean i don't patient if the patient opens the novel health once they click on the link instructions at the at the very below they click on which uh specifies all the things i need to do to connect to novel health inside the link right right but what i'm saying is my patient don't even know about novel health okay so you want to send out reminder you know what i am saying yeah so i'm sending a reminder did i do it right um yeah this looks okay you send this out to a specific patient um i i did it for just follow up visits any telehealth visit mhm okay and this is how you want to send it out to the patients yeah is that okay because for the telehealth there is no appointment reminder like right yes there's an appointment reminder thats sent out automatically before the appointments but it's just the day of right the day of yeah an hour before and 15 minutes before yes right so what i'm saying is i want something even before that it says hey you have a telehealth appointment okay okay let me have a look there might be a work around to this what do you mean work around it do it right now this is okay but i believe this is um a different type of reminder inside the system so so then what is this doing i'll let you look i'm sorry okay um jessica at the current moment so all these reminders uh that we are sending out to patients these are not configured for telehealth reminders since we that feature is still in the implementation phase uh they're working on it to have that feature added on to curemd so to send out alerts two days a few days before that's not possible inside the system for telemedicine at the moment okay so then what is this this is just for the office visit that you can send out to patients but right now i believe you're not doing offices at the moment right but if i could you tell me the exact exact concern of the patients yeah but i mean it says follow up visit telemedicine these are the these are the reasons why we click on it um how do i explain this to you um so these are primarily used for any other reminders other than telehealth medicine for instance the patients you need to ask the patient to bring in any notes or any forms that need to fill out the patients so these reminders work that way but these are not configured with telemedicine at the moment so telemedicine uh reminders of standard that are inside the system so the patient will receive them a day before an hour before and 15 minutes before those reminders that we send out to the patients okay so i mean even if this is just for in the people that come in i mean would it if i okay maybe i don't understand why it would be bad to send us this is this will be sent to anybody that has an appointment with me right yes but this won't show them about telemedicine it won't show them to click on this link and no no no i know i know that's not the purpose of this email that's not what i'm asking the purpose of this email is to remind them that they have a telehealth okay so that they're looking for the novel health link if you log into the okay could you give me a moment let me just confirm this with someone sure okay jessica so yeah i had i had confirmation from my team just this is one way that you can send out telehealth reminders as well and this will be sent out on the trigger that you have uh mentioned over there three days before five days and six days i believe that you have mentioned so this will be automatically sent out to all the patients regarding the telehealth okay cool i believe uh they made some changes to this that's why i wasn't informed about those changes they just informed me that can be used for all the purposes now oh good yeah um okay so oh can you show me how to delete uh um oh yeah the prescription thing um i just uh texted our eprescriptions team and they said in order to cancel the prescription you need to give the pharmacy a call and ask them to cancel at their end yeah so once they cancel it there and then you'll be able to see that cancelled under cancel response on the left side okay all cancelled orders gotcha the pharmacy has to cancel it so you can just give the pharmacy a call and ask them to cancel this prescription and that will be displayed over here okay okay okay um alright and then um no i think that's it okay thank you so much for your help i really appreciate it okay no worries i just need to ask you one thing how is your documentation so far good yeah yeah anything else that i can help you improve yeah i mean i like i did an intake today and there are some things that i'd like to change okay um so i don't know what's the best way to do that mm i mean i can do it right now i just need to leave in like 20 minutes okay we can schedule it for tomorrow as well its okay okay alright so what time should i give you a call tomorrow um i could do it at 8:30 or nine nine would be best for me as well okay i'll give you a call at nine and we'll go through because um right now how much is it better you don't have to rewrite each and everything yes everything is populating over uh well i don't know because it's like i haven't um like all these people are people i haven't seen i've already seen i understand um now maybe let me see yeah so i haven't seen her yet so the other all new that's the down time but um okay i think we'll sit down tomorrow look at the note templates and see where we can reduce your documentation okay sounds good tomorrow at 9 yeah i'll give you a call thank you you're welcome have a nice day okay bye bye you too bye bye"}}, {"id": 582, "data": {"call_id": "1622641389.1240475.txt", "text": ""}}, {"id": 583, "data": {"call_id": "1620841386.840866.txt", "text": "thank you for calling

practitioner um she doesn't have any experience with our electronic medical record we've just been doing hipaa and osha and all that um she's watched a couple of people um but and she's logged in so um that's about as far as we got perfect so i'll just um uh take from here i'll uh train her on uh the application how the overall um models looks like and uh does she need any information regarding scheduling uh no okay so um i'll just give her an overview how to see the appointments and everything but i can certainly show her how to uh make provider notes and uh how to attach medications or um you know clinically things on providing yeah and if you would just touch on templates a little bit um you know making their templates for their um clinical provider note um i've got somebody that the other nurse practitioner can help her i'm gonna put you on speaker hold on okay so um alright robin just a quick question by templates you mean uh the provider no templates how to create them uh you don't have to show her how to create them but just show her where it is and you can cut you know um i don't expect you to teacher and set one up today um just so she's familiar with it okay so how to customize uh note templates right yeah yeah okay i can certainly do that yeah and we do a lot of um messages you know with um patients calling in the operators take a message and then send to the provider so if you could test on our due on that you're you could and then um there is a let me just show you there is a whole lot i have you on speaker now um any of these tests patients you can use okay i'll do that i'll do that okay alright um um miss love is right here and um i'm gonna hand it over to you guys and if you need anything let me know perfect i'll do that thank you ok alright there you go hello good morning how are you i'm doing good how about you i'm good thank you um uh so the um let me just uh give you a brief introduction of how curemd works exactly do you want me to call you doctor keltonhowser or miss love miss love is alright okay this is fine alright perfect so um miss love actually uh this is whenever you log in you already have the login credentials for curemd correct alright so whenever you log into curem d uh this is the landing page where you will see um a lot of things up top there are quick links and uh feel free to uh stop me any time miss love uh if you have any questions okay so this is uh the alright no worries um so this is the dashboard this is the landing page whenever you sign into your curemd this is the home model you can say so up top you have quick links uh the inbox tab uh the today's patient tab so if you need to see um if you have any pending inbox message is basically the same like gmail or um hotmail uh or any other email service that you use um this is basically the same thing but then these messages are the internal messages so if uh uh let's say robin sends you an internal message of using your curemd you should be able to see that message in this inbox tab you can see the messages here as well if you click on practice you should be able to see the practice messages here as well so this particular message sent to you that is why you're able to see it um so it has uh you can just mark it unread because uh this was uh you already had that message so um on your left hand side these are the messages if you need to send out a message you can simply compose it and um you need to make sure if you need to send it to a patient you need to go into the patient model if you need to send it to someone in the practice you can compose it in the practice uh model you click on the message and when you when you compose the message there's the two options you simply need to click on the two options you can select any of the users from here you can click on next or maybe you can search them with their names and once you do you click on it and that name would be you would be able to see it in here and you can type in the message and send it to them so uh this is the messages tab and this is the tasks tab so if you have any um any task you have been assigned with the uh from the practice you should be able to see a notification here as well where you can see the messages and if you need to assign a certain task to somebody else you can always create a new task and assign it to someone else then um up top can you see this uh blue uh the green looking on right so these are the online at this time uh with a pipe speak as you can see 12 people are online so uh then down below you have the er x tab so e r x tab is basically where you can see all the electronic prescription um medications all the electronic prescriptions all the medications that was sent to the patients let's see uh you need to see um the uh current medications that have been already sent to the patient pharmacy you click on new rx activity and over there you would be able to see all the medications that have been sent already you can see the sent status the current medication which pharmacy it was sent to and the patient's name and the date so that's how you can do it that's what you can do it on your uh home module then you have the orders and lab results you can see all the orders and lab results in here if you need to see your pending notes you should be able to see it in my notes then uh this one is not important at this stage so i'll just keep that for now uh my preferences is basically if you need to change certain things uh according to your uh requirement or just for your uh user account so let's see if you go to general you will see certain changes uh that you can make just with your account this particular change uh be implemented for the whole practice just uh for your account let's say you need to see multiple scheduler uh five use you can see that in here you can change that uh the default landing page was the personal page the whole module but if you need to change it to any other page you can do that as well let's say you have a lot of uh patient provider notes that you normally look into you can change it to patient module so whenever you sign into um um it automatically takes you to the patient page uh we'll get into that later how you what it does and how you can search for patients and everything then you have uh the payment tab the patient tabs these are all the changes that you need to make with your account this one is important uh quick links so as you can see these up top banners are called quick links currently in box is grayed out so it is always there for everybody uh today's patient is checked as a default but if you need to uh add any other quick links let's say you click on documents refill request uh procedures or lab or anything that you uh have that you would be using on a daily uh basis you can select them and hit save and you should be able to see all the quick links up top okay so that is um the whole module and if you uh look into your uh right top corner you should be able to see your name and then that's the practice details whenever you're uh logging out from curemd you click click on log out and uh you can just uh then we have the release those options uh where you can see uh the current releases we have planned and um what are the changes you're going to implement you can see that in here then if you go to support uh there is an option of knowledge base knowledge base uh basically what it does is if you have any questions related to uh patients uh providing for clinical um model or anything related to curemd you can click on knowledge base and you can simply type in the um issue you're having and uh you you will find a lot of faqs and a lot of uh already uh uh made templates by to answer your questions so you can do that from there then you have a log a ticket option uh so basically what it does is so whenever you're having any issues and you're not able to find it in the knowledge base so you do not have time to uh you know uh for all those answers you simply log a ticket what you do is you click on log a ticket and um you type in the subject what exactly the issue you're facing if you need to describe it you can do that you can select the module type severity you can put in your email address and your best call back number and hit submit you can also attach any um you know attachment with it as well that you need us to see uh we would be able to see it in their uh in the ticket so once you log the ticket uh it directly gets assigned to me um uh even hughes and i'm the account manager for your practice so i look into all the clinical issues but if it's something related to billing uh module i get it assigned to the billing team but as far as the clinical issues are concerned and the concerned person and i will be looking into it and i will contact you uh as soon as possible to resolve that concern so make sure uh you type in the correct email address so that you can get daily updates um that we try to contact you or what exactly is that we discussed and uh your best call back number so that we can get in touch with you in order to resolve that concern so um that's that um let me go back to uh okay so then we have the patients module so this is basically i believe that the main thing that you will be using because you will be dealing with patients and uh you will be uh uh you know maybe uh adding their provider notes i'll go ahead and tell you how you can do that so um once you go module you can simply search the patients uh with their first name or last name let's say type and adam so all the patients with this name that these um alphabets in their names uh you should be able to see them um these are there um date of birth and these are the account numbers so you can either search the patient with the first name or last name or you can simply type in the account number let's say 1024 so with the with that particular uh account number let's say 100 you should be able to see um the patients with their um uh account number so on the search tab you can search uh pretty much uh with the patients account number or patients um the first name or last name but if you do not have those um uh in that information you can simply click on advanced and here you have all the um you know a detailed kind of uh patient search engine where you can search the patient with the mobile number or their home number or if you need to search them with their uh address or the location maybe the appointments from their zip code numbers um so anything uh you should be able to uh this is a detailed search criteria where you can search for the patients not much people use it uh they do have uh the first name and last name so you should be good if you type it in here and on your left hand side um these are the patient heartless so uh with your account i believe these patients were open earlier so that is why you can see that in a in a in a uh you know um uh most recent uh patient uh order right now so you can always a political order or the most recent ones or the most frequent patients that you go to every day uh so you can sort that option out under my preferences as i showed you earlier so that would be just for your account but uh the generic is when uh you can see them in the most recent manner um so this was the last patient you open so that is why you're able to see it whenever you um who were over to the patient's name you should be able to see the uh the main information uh their address the agenda the uh age their date of birth the email address the number and their provider name and the account number as well so um let me open up a test station for you see how exactly it looks like so let's say we open up test amanda so all right let me give you another uh let me tell you another thing as well so if you click on task if you type in the patient's name do you see these great out options patient test for these are the inactive patients so whenever you see that uh it means that this patient is inactive this patient is no more in the practice and whenever you see a red looking um patient's name as you can see here in your patient heartless jade this is a red flag patient i'll tell you how you can mark the patient red flag and what could be the reasons for marking the patient red flag but let's just open up a test patients so as i said before this is the patient's name uh patients out of wood and patients account number so let's open up the test patient okay so once you open up a test patients you will see a clinical overview of that patient where you can see their history their allergies their complaints the medications their diagnosis so uh you can always change that but i believe this is the generic criteria for everybody in the pipes they should be able to see everything in one window so that's how it is set for now up top you can see the patient's name uh if they have any pictures attached with that patient um you can see the picture as well uh their age their um gender their account number their home number they're referring provider they're white tails you should be able to see them in here so this is the patient banner you can say where you can find all the information in there uh the allergy insurance notes and everything so let's say um you need to go to uh the detailed demographics page where you should be able to see um you know all the um insurances and everything how that looks like so you simply need to click on registration tab in here and you click on profile so once you click on profile uh you should be able to see the the demographics page for this particular patient uh same thing all the um information for this particular patient is in their their uh social security their date of birth the uh gender um their preferred language uh they're referring providers and so on everything is in here what these tabs up top uh and again please feel free to ask any questions and stop me anytime all right so um these are the top things if you need to make any changes you can simply hit save uh once you make the changes market active as i told you before the great out of the market active let's say this patient is not no more coming to the office anymore um you can just mark the patient and from here you can mark the patient red flag uh if you click on red flag it will show you multiple reasons why you are marking this patient red flag let's say patient reside in s or these are all the options that whatever added as a red flag so you can either choose it uh from this particular drop down you can select do not schedule or whatever the reason is if the reason is not in here you can simply um add a new one you can add the reason hit save and that patient will be marked red flag and that red flag is basically for um uh if you have any balances do if you do not want to schedule this patient or if you have to put in any information you can put it in there and it uh uh it costs the uh users uh i that this particular patient mark red flag will be able to as well then um uh you can print the super bill from this for this patient you can fax the demographics to another uh patients um you know any other uh wherever you need to fax this information for the patient demographics you can do that from here the logs is basically um if you who exactly made changes to this patient's account uh you can click on log and you should be able to see who made the changes for this particular account at what time and if you expanded what were the changes that were made so um that's the demographics page then we have the insurance tab i'm just giving you a brief overview so that at least uh you have uh a bit of knowledge how patients module works and will go into the main thing that is the provider notes as i discussed with um robin earlier so uh the insurance tab i believe you would not be doing anything related to this uh this is the front desk job uh even uh when i go to the scheduler tab um that is not something that concerns you but i will give you uh an overview how it works exactly so insurance tab is where you can find patient insurances uh contacts tab is uh if you have if the patient has any um you know uh any responsible party or any um support contact if they have any siblings or uh there um you know uh guardians you can always add those in here consent tab is if the patient uh comes into the practice a new patient uh the practice asked them to sign certain consent forms whether uh they can sign it via patient portal by sitting at their homes or they can simply uh do it from the front end when they come into the office and define that particular form you should be able to see all the consent forms in here then you have uh the disclosures tab if you need to disclose something for this particular patient you can always add it in here preference uh purposes tab there um uh if you need to add any preferred pharmacy for this patient any uh you can block any appointments for this patient you can add pretty much uh anything in this preferred tab if you want them to receive text messages if you do not want to uh want them to receive text messages you can make changes to it hit save and that will be done and then you have the restrictions tab let's say um this particular patient is a critical and you do not want this patient um you you know you do not want other users to see this patient you can simply um click on user you can add those users that you do not want this patient that they can access from their end you can certainly do that i have a quick question please in the preference area i don't have to worry about it i don't want that we'll do that one right so the preference tab is basically um uh so this is not something that concerns you but i'll tell you what it does um so this this is the genetic settings for uh the purpose is all the patients when they are added into the system but if you need to change things like uh pharmacy or you do not want them to see the to receive a text message or something like that that is something that i believe front desk or any clinical staff looks into that but um um yes that that is something that does not concern you um but if you need to make any changes just for this patient as you remember i showed you your preferences earlier that will be changed just for your account these are the preferences preferences just for this particular patient so if you need to make that but uh i believe you will not be doing that okay right so uh then we go to demographic so this is basically the main pages i showed you earlier um all the details for the particular patient uh on your left hand side as you can see there are referrals have uh if you need to refer this patient to any other uh provider you can do that from incoming and outgoing if it's an incoming those in here outgoing you can add those details in here uh then the family is basically the family tree um where you can find all the things related to that particular patient uh as i showed you earlier about the contacts if you add certain contacts in there you should be able to see the family tree in here these notes okay so there is a difference between provider notes and the patient notes so these patient notes are the notes that you can see in the patient banner up top so if you add any notes you can see there are certain added charge created to bill so if you need to add any um uh notes in here you should be able to add them in here or add them from here and it will reflect in the notes section so uh other mhm i'm sorry so if i put a note on that red top on the i mean in the notes area at the top that's not gonna stay there or that will stay there but you will only see uh the recent ones up there uh and uh or the most uh you can say uh i'll show you so let's go to notes so if you put the priority high be adding this and you can hit save so you can see it in red color the yellow color is basically the priority was um uh normal and the green one is the low so if the priority is high you should be able to see it up top if it's normal uh right next to it if there's too many high priorities you should not be able to see them in the notes section because there's a little space there if it's low then uh you should be able to see them in uh the patient notes in here so all the patients them in here but the priority wise you should be able to see it in the patients yeah go ahead but but it stays how you cannot delete it like even though later on you can delete them let's see if we are able to delete them uh so let's say i added this uh test exactly so test basically click on it let's see if we can of the time so you see you can believe them as well oh okay right so uh but you will not be able to lead them from here i believe you can let's click on it no you cannot so um you simply need to go to patient notes select the ones that you need to delete you click on remove tag and it will be okay alright um then uh you have all good here okay all right so then you go to letters there are certain letters that you can attach with this patient i believe this is something that you would not be doing but if you do i believe somebody can uh tell you how it can be done but um if you attach any letters you can do that from here these are all the templates okay so now the main part is the provider notes part to provider notes are basically um these are for uh uh knows practitioners and the providers if jay need to document all the allergies all the medications all the uh history all the complaints everything uh related to patient it once they see the patient they document everything so just give me please alright so uh as you can see these are the visit dates uh so that particular patient visited uh the practice on this date and that's when the provider note was created so let's say you need to add a new provider note you simply click on this provider note then uh you can select the provider let's say we select your name and their uh you can select the note template these are the uh noticed that uh was added by the request of pikes peak uh they requested uh template should be there as i discussed with uh you need to know how to edit the as well and later on i'll show you how you can do that but these are the uh let's say you select initial visit pikes uh you can select the note template you can select the visit reason so just so you know miss love um um whenever an uh an appointment is scheduled um they already have a visit reason right i will also show you schedule tab how you can create a note but this is just i'm showing you from the patients uh profile how you can create a new note so if you need to create a new note from the patient's profile you need to also select the visit reason as well let's say this uh patients visit was um new patient 16 minutes alright then you select the location i believe um this is the location uh then you select and then you hit create because um these uh static ones these are the mandatory ones that you need to uh like everything and you hit create so now uh you selected no template as an issue visit so that this is the template for that particular um uh uh provide a note so this is the this is how you can see uh their first name last name is automatically generated the date of birth everything in there uh if they have any vitals uh you can always put that in here okay so now let's uh go into the details and this one is the one that you said this one is a month correct this one is the one that you said it's almost like the review of systems the name the account number and all these things right the review of systems why this is populating this uh many in this much information is because there are certain provider notes that we created earlier for this patient so this is uh not a new patient this is a patient where so if if there is a new patient so all this will be blank so what it is doing is it is uh populating the previous uh provider note data to a new provider note you can always make changes to it you click on it and you can certainly make changes let's say you do negative and then you can just hit this and you hit accept so this will change the review of systems so it depends on first it will populate the previous uh provider notes data and then you can change it according to the new session that you had with the patient okay alright so um i believe you do not have the signing permission at this stage but uh i believe um once uh uh your um fully up and running and you know what to do exactly and once you spend some time in the practice i believe robin will give you that access and if she does not maybe she does not remember you can just simply ask her that you're not able to sign provider note so he can give you that access once you give you that access they should be an option of signing here right next to save so whenever you're done with the patients provide a note you can simply sign that provider note all right then um uh you have uh on your left hand side as you can see this a lot of options in here there are prescription tab if you drop click on drop down this is the option whenever you see this option that means that there was certain medication that was prescribed to this patient on this particular date so you can see the drop down in here as well histories you can find the patients histories in here review of systems you can find it in here on what they uh the system was added and you can see what was added by clicking on them then on this particular uh patients uh this particular no template uh you can click on vital these are the uh you can say uh flags that are already added and uh uh note template so you can put in all the vitals in here except let's say 1 50 wait we hit accept so you should be able to see the weight in here and it says that you have added this uh weight and everything you you it's it would be under your name you can check the logs as well it will be shown that you made certain changes so uh each click uh you uh so each click uh we have uh logs for that so whenever uh somebody is doing something and uh later on they need to see who exactly made those changes uh we do have logs for every click okay then um there is a complaint option if you need to add any complaints you can add them in here you can search it from the search bar hit accept and the complaint will be added review of systems medical history you can see it in here uh you if you need to change any medical history you can click on it you can select what is that you need to change you can put in the description that test test hit accept and it will be added in the medical history as you can see a cancer test test test then we have social history tab you can click on it so if there is a new patient so how you would see the uh this particular tabs uh just like this the complaint section so this one means that there is nothing attached in the previous provider notes that is what you're seeing it like this and if it's a new patients all this will be just flags right now you're seeing everything because it is auto populating the data from the previous provider notes so family tab you can add the family history in it what exactly is that uh the issue you can search the diseases you can put it in all in here uh let's say um migraine headache you simply hit accept and it will be added in the family history and you can remove the previous ones as well same thing allergies you can have go ahead please i'm sorry and then you said i can also let's say they um what do you call that like let's say they have something in the family history and then i wanted to delete it i can also do that one right so uh right now there are four uh family history that are added so let's say we go in here we delete this one we delete right and then we hit accept so those one will be deleted and only two you would be able to see so you can delete them as well and it goes for everything you can delete medications allergies social history everything you can do that then um uh there is uh medication steps these are the medications that have been prescribed to the patient you can click on it you can see all these medications uh you can simply um let's see so you can see the past medications as well you can see the current medications let's say um click on just this medication and hit accept you see everything is now uh lost you can see only one medication you need to add all the medications you click on them the ones that you need to attach with this patient you simply hit accept and you should be able to see them and once you click on them uh the prescribed options is that this particular medication has been prescribed to this patient already you can see the right and let's say uh you need to prescribe a certain medication to this patient uh let's say we go to the current uh okay i'll show you in the prescription how you can do that but if you go to next let me show you okay so that's the physical exam alright so then there's a physical exam um if you need to add anything same thing you click on it and you select the next or anything uh cardiovascular or anything you need to make any changes uh it's tender normal just give me one second i believe you're not able to make any changes because there's a block to it as well at this stage that is why okay alright so um uh you can uh if you need to click on normal hit accept it will be done if you need to manually added anything you can put in scar this this you hit accept and it will be added in the physical exam okay then um diagnosis uh if you need to attach any diagnosis with this particular patient you click on it um you can attach same thing you can attach diagnosis you can add new diagnosis in here as well uh and then you can hit save and it will automatically show on the provider note then um we have a plan you can add procedures let's say you need to prescribe medication you click on prescription you select continue and then you can select any medication from here these are the current medication that was assigned or that was prescribed or you can just add a new medication if you click on this medication and then um we select the uh uh for how many days what's the quantity if there are refills you select the provider and then um you click on the erx once you click on erx this particular medication will be sent to this pharmacy that is mentioned in here you can always choose another pharmacy from the drop down as well select another pharmacy and then you can select any pharmacy and uh send them the medication if you need to simply prescribed the medication but you don't want patients to get that medication you can click on prescribe if you need to uh let's say a pharmacy does not accept um you can simply print out this prescription and hand it over to the patient and the patient can get the medication from that pharmacy okay okay so um let me see where did the prescription okay sorry this is the prescription okay and let's say um uh uh uh miss love if there is uh something that is missing in the provider note but you on your left hand side you can see a lot of options here as well so if there's something missing i believe everything is covered right now but if there is i believe allergies will not i believe it so if you need to add any allergies you click on allergies here so you see this option uh current provider notes so this is already uh opened up the um all the options for you so if you need to add anything extra to this provider note you can select from this list as well okay then you have the clinical tab you can select this from here as well i believe all the um tabs are already all the tags are already added but if you need to add anything extra you can do that from here then if you need to see any labs or radiology results you can see them here um okay so uh documents tab is basically if you attach any documents to this particular patient um you can click on documents and you should be able to see all these files and you can search for these uh documents if there are any attached documents so as this one is correspondence one so this one is added you click on it and you should be able to see that document then uh we have the appointment tab so if you click on status it will show you when uh exactly this patient was scheduled the last appointment was on thursday may 27 and so on all the previous appointments you would be able to see them in here okay and the appointment okay right and then there's the billing tab i believe the billing tab if you need a training on billing uh that is something we have another team who looks into the billing team who looks into the billing um issues or billing uh so they will be able to explain to you how billing works um so let's go back to that provider note so we were in this provider note so now once the once the provider has put in all the details in here everything is done the provider now needs to simply okay so you do have the signing permissions okay i am not sure why you were not able to see it earlier just give me a second so you go to provide an old mhm okay so this is the search criteria as well that you can use in order to search for all the provider notes so this was the provider what you created okay so your name is not let me give you those um required permissions because you should have those permissions you're able to see other providers uh uh notes but you're not able to sign yours just give me one minute okay okay so i believe in your account was made um uh it was there before when you were added as a provider so it should be good now so let's go to the patient module this is the patient hot list we went to this patient earlier uh then we go to the provider notes this was the provider note you created today click on it and you see the sign option so once uh we're done with the provider note and you pretty much did everything uh you simply click on sign options and you click yes okay okay you can just select no for now because it will be sent to uh mr richard okay so once you sign this note that means that this particular note has been signed now the only part left you can also unsigned the note you do have that option and permissions as well but uh now it means that this patient note has been signed if you need to make any changes you simply un sign it and then uh you know make the changes and sign it back again so once you sign it right so this is just uh so so like let's say i sign it and then i forgot something and then i realized i realized it later so i can assign my thing i have to do and then it's not gonna ask me like any reason why i'm doing or no it will not ask you any reason uh it will simply added in the logs that you unsigned this note and then you um made some changes but let me tell you one thing uh would you be using uh would you be creating super bills or any billing related things for the patient you know what i'm not sure but they're going to teach me like how to bill the patient i might be right so in in the future you will be doing the billing right so uh let me tell you one thing uh you can edit the note uh you can unsigned the note but once you see this option uh created create esuper bill so this is where all the billing things well so if you click on create e super bill so once you create any super bill and um so e super bill will automatically populate everything that you have mentioned in the provider note so let's go to the e super bill so all the diagnosis that other than the provider note you should be able to see them in here all the proceed past you should be able to see them in here once you sign the save and sign this particular um super bill so it will contain all the charges as well right so once you save any super bill and uh it will be sent to the uh relevant team and it will be sent to the uh to the insurance and once the insurance has um you know cleared that payment and once the payment has been done the amount has been claimed then you would not be able to unsign a note because basically everything in the provider note then you create a super bill to get the claim right from the patient's insurance so once the uh once you hit save and sign um uh you will not be able to make any changes to the e super bill but you can still make changes to provide a note but that will not make sense because uh it will not include something in the e super bill so if the if you uh if the e super bill is not sign let me tell you so we created this let's go back to the provider note okay so this uh particular uh a note has been signed you create e super bill it takes you to the e super bill uh and it's save and sign and sign it then uh you cannot make any changes to provider notes but if it's not if you are still in the provider note and it says edit e super bill that means the claim has not been sent to the to the sorry uh insurance right so then you can make changes but once uh the uh create super bill tab is not there that means that the provider note has been signed to create the super bill has been signed and there's nothing you can do about it uh there is a one day gap so once you sign uh uh any super bill and within 24 hours you need to make any changes you need to contact our billing team and they would be able to tell you how they can you know resolve that for you but it's just a 24 hour window signing super bowl and if you need to make any changes so as you can see uh whenever you click on provider notes you should be able to see this status for that particular provider note so that this says that the provider notice sign and super bill it says not created right so if it says created or uh if it says uh billed or claim then you cannot do anything about it so okay so what what is like in the super bill area why did it say not created okay so if you click on it again why does it say not created because we did not creat it so once we creat it once we creat it we click on save and sign let's uh let me just do that to show you so if you save it it will say that it's been created let me show you how that so once we save it let's go back to the progress note so now you see it before it says that um create a super bill now it says edit e super bill yeah alright okay so once you save it that means that the e super bill is there but you can edit it but it's not signed yet okay so now if you go back to that page it will say this uh status of this particular provider note is signed e super bill it is in draft uh state so before if you if it was not created now it's in draft so you click on that particular provide note you click on edit e super bill and then you click on sign once it's done so you click on sign do you want to sign e super bill you say yes so now the super bill has been signed and um as i mentioned earlier uh miss love um once it is signed uh you would uh know when exactly it was signed and what was the time within 24 hours if you need to make any changes you can simply do that but after that it will be sent to the uh insurance and it will be claim and there's nothing the billing team can do to reverse that change if it's something on priority there are certain things that the billing team can do but that is not my domain so i'm not sure and i'm not aware what is that they can do at that stage but i believe other billing administrators they would have an idea um how that works so now we signed the e super bill you go to provider notes again now can you see that the status says signed for the provider note and super bill assigned as well so that way you can um so let's say uh the status says signed uh for the provider note and super bill it says draft or not created so that means that you can simply go to the provider note and you can un sign that provide a note and make any changes if you want but once the e super bill is signed i suggest you do not you should not make any changes to the provider note it makes sense yes that makes sense perfect no worries alright so that's basically it for the uh provide a note and the patient module same thing you go to the patient module you click on any of the patients uh you search for the patients you let's say we click on this patient you go to provider notes you see they provider note so everything is now uh done from here um um okay so next thing is the scheduling tab uh robin asked me that you will not be using it but i just wanted to give you a brief overview how it okay so once you scheduler as you can see these are the providers that are uh already in here um this is today's date these are all the patients that are scheduled and the difference in color means different status so if you click on summary uh it will show you what uh color means what appointment status so if it's blue it's schedule if it's a yellow it's no show if it's green it's confirmed as you can see there are some that are confirmed and this uh pink looking um one is checked in so this patient has been checked in and checked out as you can see there's a minor differences checked out uh think and a little bit darker color for checked out and if you need to see the status of that appointment you can simply who were over to that appointment as you can see the status is checked out and if you go into the other patient uh it says status confirmed different color means different appointments statuses right right right so and now you know so um miss love this is the providers uh is uh you know you can say uh providers domain where you can select any of these providers i believe your scheduler is not get added into the system once robin adds that uh you should be able to see your name in here as well so these particular dates uh if it's a green uh looking um uh you know they that means that there is no appointment scheduled if it's uh red as you can see the problem that means that there is a block on that particular scheduler it could be uh it there could be any reason for that it could be a public holiday or if uh you have a meeting on that particular date uh the block the scheduler uh it varies from practice to practice and if it's uh or orange looking um uh um uh color on the on the scheduler it means that uh and it says one so that means there is one schedule appointments if you were hover over you can see that it is uh saying that there is one schedule appointment you click on it you should be able to see that particular appointment and um how you can go to provider notes by from scheduler that is something that you can do you can simply click on the patient's name once the patient is checked in all right so let's say you need to go to this patient demographics you can click on it and it says patient demographics and it will take you to that page where i showed you provider notes and demographics and all the details that the patient has in the system you can see that from there so if you click on check in once the patient is check in there should be an option of create provider note right from here so you can go to the scheduler you can go to that particular appointment you can check in the patient once the patient is in the office and use uh you're going to check in the patient you check in the patient you would see that option create provide a note and once you click on it it will take you to that page where you can create provider notes and everything the clinical orders the um medication the allergies the diagnosis the procedures everything you would be able to see that in there okay alright and then this is the daily scheduler and then we have the weekly scheduler where you can see uh for one provider you can see uh uh for the whole week scheduler so let's say i select any particular um provider let's say i select this provider so this provider does not have any scheduler um let's see you know the okay so for a doctor uh born uh you can see the whole week scheduler in one window you can see all the patients and everything then we have the multiple multiple tabs basically if you need to select different locations and different providers at the same time and again this is something not related to you this is something from the product they would be looking into all the um locations and all the providers scheduler in one window if they want to see it they use this option okay right so this is basically the scheduler tab then we have the document manager as i showed you earlier in the patient's charge you can see the documents from the patient's profile and if you need to go to the document manager and search for the patient in here you can search for the patient you can search for the let's say i opened up so this was the um patient we were testing on so you can click on it you should be able to see all the documents in here and uh if there there is any document in the folder you should be able to see that in here as well so that's basically it uh for the whole model uh the patient model so what we covered today is the whole model patient model scheduling model document manager um other than that these are the things that are not applicable at this stage for you this is the reports tab this is the billing tab these are the calls uh so uh the report section is basically where you you do not have access to it at the moment but uh if you need to uh extract some sort of report for within the system that how let's say it was related or demographics or any any sort of report you can always do that from here right now you do not have access to that but uh once you have access you can see all those reports okay so that's pretty much it um that's the whole overview how curemd works how you can add new provider notes how you can see patient's appointment status is how you can edit your preferences everything we covered in there uh now there's one more thing that um robin mentioned that we need to uh have access to edit note templates so as we search earlier the this patient uh we click on the provider notes i didn't provider note so you see these note template so these note templates if uh they ask you to edit these note templates how you can do that so you can see all these note templates right so uh maybe uh if you have a pen and paper handy um you can uh write it down this love uh that would be let me yeah let me write that down all right okay so in order to edit a particular provider note you need to go to settings settings okay let me write that down this one is to edit okay so go to settings i will stop right right corner you click on settings uh there is settings you have in here you uh expand the templates option okay let me see uh mm left expand okay okay alright so i'm not very good with computers i'm like i have the right that's that's perfectly fine miss love and that is why we are here to help you out on uh in each stage if you're having any issues as i mentioned earlier you can always log a ticket even if it's a basic thing there's uh obviously you will take some time to learn the emr how it was and by the time you get used to the system i'm pretty sure you'll have a lot of questions you did not ask much much questions today but you will have a lot of questions down the line once you get used to the system that's when we come in we help you out for all those issues right so let us know you now know how to log a ticket you you can simply log a ticket for all the minor things major things any issues that you're having okay so uh settings then templates then you click on notes here no mhm okay right so now these are all the uh provided notes that are added in the system as you can see there are seven pages of them so let's say um robin asks you or somebody else asks you to edit this template that you need to make some changes on this particular template you search for that template or you can complete it next and search for that particular template you open it up they will give you the name you open it up and then you can make any changes to it and uh this is basically related to the customization team they normally do that and if you need help you can log a ticket that you need to edit the template i will not be able to help you out with it because that is again not my domain i will forward that ticket to the customization team and they will be able to help you out how you can make so uh this is a template as you can see uh let's say they ask you to remove medical history in it you can simply select it and hit delete and it can be removed if you need to add any fields so these are the field these these are the fields medical history the history so you can select what field you need to add uh if it's a patient balance or whatever it is you can simply hit insert and it will be added in here i am not able to do it right now because this is a live template and we do not want to miss anything so um that's how you can edit the template right so again settings uh just close this tab settings uh templates right so you should be able to see all the notes in here okay so um basically miss love i believe um we covered pretty much everything um that uh you need to know at this stage i think it's a lot of information just for the first day but uh again um we are always here to help you if you have any questions down the line and uh you can always ask anybody from the

md its image formula R40 you said i am sorry no problem mm yes okay okay we need the uh admin on on this computer to ensure the user name and the password why did i do that um okay one second you you got it every test strong right now great scanner software is installed as well okay open discounts directly from it log in to curemd please and uh one more thing were you able to scan before or i was able to scan i just can't scan into i'm already logged into curemd right here um i just wasn't able to uh like put it from curemd usually i can say like the scanners connected here in like this little corner right here that way it'll pop up the documents will go here that way i'm not going from file folder to the documents and all that well the reason why you're getting this message just because you're um you will be able to scan or scan feature work if we get you logged into the safari grounds with uses compatible over there i have to make sure you're logged into supply if you are able to scan before then it's definitely under safari no like i wasn't able to this is a new office so i wasn't able to scan it all yet over here like we just got a new scanner so we're just trying to hook it up to curemd me i was never able to i was able to scan like i can go to the like the application and scan regularly but i can't scan in curemd alright and this is what we're going to check that if it's i'm gonna allow you to scan in your curemd or if we need to use this tool provided with this scanner to scan the documents and then upload them into the application using this button over here so can i get you logged in under safari and then we can check it over there because home doesn't include that feature so chrome will never have that uh not for now um our development team is already looking into a way where we can make it compatible under chrome and all other browsers as well it is fully compatible on windows computer but on mac there's a limitation that it works only under uh safari browser and that is also valid for the older version of mac i do see that yours is probably compatible because it's still under 10.15  i see over here um it does work under 10.14 for mac OS it doesn't work for 10.16 which is the latest one so uh we need to confirm but if it's gonna be well i mean if if it doesn't go to chrome is that's what i use so i will just do it the way that i have been doing it then um please use the software that is provided over here you can put you on to you you are aware of using the software mhm okay yeah i've already done i've i mean i've already scanned it was just easier because where i used to come where i came from the other office they were windows computers and it was just all right into so exactly that's exactly so uh in this case unfortunately you'll have to scan the documents using the software first and they will be placed under a particular order and then you may go into pure envy you may choose the folder where you would like to upload that document"}}, {"id": 607, "data": {"call_id": "1620837580.839071.txt", "text": "thank you for calling curemd this is jeff how may i help you sorry what was your name again hello hi sorry what was

sorry the um that's the scheduler in the schedule the appointment will be still there as soon as you are so that's fine but under the charge you know how when patients schedule what the office is doing is they're creating a ticket for the patient when the patient don't show up uh well the patient was never seen it was scheduled patient and cancel or anything but the ticket was generated because patient was doctor supposed to see this patient over the phone okay so then he didn't have a chance he had to go to the hospital so that we checked in patient but he never saw it so therefore the ticket is generated so i just need to remove that ticket remove that ticket like do you want me to i'm sorry remove that charge survey under the charge and date of service 12 9 20 so i just want to see how can we just delete that line item automatically uh sure i can actually let you know how you can do that can you please confirm what status is actually being shown when you actually go to the charges section is it under check in status confirm schedules or like what is the actual status on the charges well on the charger charges we just put charged because um there was nothing we just had to use the procedure as 99999 and then go through a line item without charging so can i have the patient account number sure it's 75 92 7592 and it's dina wards correct yep and that's for the date of service 12 9 2020 2020 let me look okay alright yes you can delete this so uh if you go to the charge actually just open up the charge on the top right corner you will see uh it's kind of so you can simply delete that now uh there's one thing only when you actually and not submitting a claim to the insurance if it's not submitted to the insurance and nothing is actually posted against this specific uh c p t or the charge only then you will be able to see this trash can so you can delete it otherwise if it's submitted already to the insurance so due to the reference data he will no longer be able to access this button to delete it all right another question once i deleted just reflecting that the patient was checked in 129 2020 so how can i remove that line item you need to go to the scheduler and on the schedule you need to either cancel this appointment or you need to actually um like if it was canceled if the patient was on scene so it should be canceled so just cancel it and this is how the uh the appointment will actually removed from the charges section as well 12 9 you just need to change the status of it okay let me see sorry my system our systems are super slow actually cure md but just give me one second please okay so editing check in okay now you don't need to add the check in page you need to actually um as soon as you were like left click on the appointment on the scheduler it says cancelled i'm sorry change status change status is the option on which you need to actually go and then you need to actually mark it as cancelled you will have several reasons there so you can put a relevant reason on it and then see well i have no idea developer reason for that line item but okay let me just check and remove that out of it uh let me check it in no it's still showing okay hold on a sec what did i do wrong change status cancel a payment has been linked to the provider notes that it cannot be changed so the provider note has been created maybe you need to do that as well yeah the provider in order was created accidentally too so how can i delete that you can simply go to the patient profile and you need to click on provider notes under registration so if i look at it it's online 2020 and it's actually under draft so this can be deleted as well so 12 9 yeah okay go to the patient profile 1st i am there so under provider notes i click on notes correct 3 18 right 3 18 or four 3 18 that's 12 12 9 2020 correct now you can actually open this up and after that you need to delete it yeah just next to the great super bill option you have delete option so just hit there and this will be deleted probably not isn't used by roger pete i can't my bad i was on the note okay can you delete it again yeah okay so now i'm there and then there is the option again i just next to the great super bill on the top on the top create super bill and just next to it there is delete button um it's a switch case i don't have that delete button give me one second let me see that let me tell you for you 12 9 2020 and it does give me the i think that's the um are you sure you want to leave the associated competence there's an image along with the note and there you go it's done can you try to change the status one more time it kind of uh it's it's there it's it's yeah i saw it it there's no data service anymore there okay so if the notes are created how come i couldn't able to delete it so i access for that correct i thought she said that she gave me the whole access to the software who i'm sorry i'm sorry my provider said that she gave me the access like she gave me the fully access to the software hm let me actually look into it give me one second can you uh go to the scheduler and change the status in the meanwhile yes thank you and you just need to it's the access actually and for now uh you don't have it but i'm actually making sure you should have it now meet you okay if you feel like we just need to talk correct let me see that patient and there you go now you have the access great so now i will i suppose to have access fully fully loaded access in this account honestly i should be able to see things um and then delete things uh whatever the provider can because you know i'm the manager here so i just i just wanna make sure that i have a full access to the account for now you have the access and it does actually uh says medical biller and i've been user type so i think it should be good but in case if you find any discrepancies at your end to let me know we'll handle this out no problem you can close the ticket thank you so much pete i really appreciate that no problem you have a great day take care you too thanks bye bye"}}, {"id": 610, "data": {"call_id": "1623077224.13385.txt", "text": "mm mm

through the whole process and then right at the very end after she answered her insurance and everything it said unable to schedule appointment and the slots were available because i went in and manually put her in those those appointment slots and then i went in to try to schedule the appointment thinking maybe the patient is something wrong you know give her the benefit of the doubt i went in step by step i did everything it didn't work it said unable to schedule appointment so i scheduled her and her daughter's appointment manually through cure md let that one go and then this other patient um oh what the heck is his name francisco something francisco he's got on the schedule today i put him on the schedule because he was unable to schedule and he just tried to do it through google okay you have to pick log in through google facebook set up an account he picked google because he has a google account it wouldn't let him he gave him the same message unable to schedule

what is the issue they're unable to sign yeah they can't save them and they can't sign them what is the error nothing it just does nothing or the cloud cloud which cloud are they um dr markowitz i think she's on 19 let me see arleen is on 18 and ocular prosthetics is on 14 are we able to do that like is it happening on our end when i was on with doctor markowitz um i could do it but she couldn't and then uh which browser was she using and then i got on her computer in chrome and i did it under my log in but she couldn't do it under hers so then she switched to a different user and she could do it with ocular prosthetics two of their providers can't with the other ones can same computer no different computers okay arleen markowitz test patient progress note so when she's clicking on create e super bill nothing's happening no it'll open up to the e super bill but then you know at the top part of the e super bill where it says uh one save and then you got saving sign neither one of those buttons will work can you take me to her computer if it's okay we can try uh not not arlene markowitz with some of the other one ocular yeah it's a lot harder because they're on a mac um i can't they can't get me logged on to it so alright lets try arleen completely black screen alright hold on carrie yes hey so did you fix the mystery no i have bread on this i mean a bruce on the phone with me from curemd here on a second i was actually really literally getting ready to leave and i locked up my computer already oh no no no no no no i can get it believe me get in and out all the time i just have to actually do that so let me grab my keys hi bruce how are you good thanks how are you i'm doing well good okay so sherry tells you my mystery all of a sudden i can't make money very distressing hang on let me just turn this thing on okay i've got it i got to get my hair pins out of the way coming on the little windows so yeah i had it happened kind of um you know towards the end of my morning of work the rest of the morning had gone well i will yesterday i had run you know just a windows update and this morning when i had to do a chrome update but um those went very smoothly and um so do i do many pro support dot com sherry go ahead um and the code it's gonna be 41273 joint session connect wise bring myself up so i had done a couple of patients and i had run the bills this is something i do very routinely because i always do my own bills and things like that and um and everything has been an eventful but then i got to one patient and i couldn't save his super bill and um which i really like to do on the fly because we give them to that as they're leaving um and um then i um then i i said gee that's odd and then i couldn't save the the my second class in the morning the last page in the morning i couldn't save her either so then i said okay let me try and explore i couldn't make it work and explorer i closed on my windows open my windows and rebooted the computer i have this other extra computer that i walk around with a laptop um i uh tried it on that that didn't work and uh sherry and i then fooled around with it a bit and we found that um it was seems to be just me as the user even though i had not gone into any of my settings and we couldn't figure out which one because when she came on as a user she was able to um to to create and save i could create it but i couldn't save or save and sign the super bill she was able to do that and then when i have this alter ego user that i hardly ever use that i created just sort of as an emergency in case i can't get in myself and that as that user i was also able to uh save a super bill and so that's where we are but as my normal self i can no longer do this so that's where we are yeah let me go ahead and get you on bruce it's uh 537-901-195 alright let's log into the application alright go ahead if you can log in for me please sure thing oh yeah my thing always gets in the way hang on a second i can okay yeah there you go i'll just take one of these again there you go that works that works now this is her user that that this is the one i use all the time the other one that i have is an emergency one is truly that i never i had not logged into it in years as a matter of fact she had it as inactive and had to reactivate yeah no i usually keep it in activity as it otherwise it's distracting to people to whom to send messages oh yeah because they both are sort of versions of my name so yeah i will deactivate her again my misspelled alter ego and as a bruce as i said to sherry i had been being good i do like to tinker under the hood and change my settings to my own liking as you may see my set up is not your you're the set up you send the system out with but i haven't been doing any of that because i've just been all morning seeing patients writing notes doing you know the e bills and that was that i think i submitted a couple of uh insurance claims so it works now well there you go i had actually as i said the computer was locked up so um i had turned it off again let me just see while i have you to lovely folks on the phone uh let's go to that patient laurie laurie and let's see if we can take her bill through to its logical conclusion which we did not do we did not create a charge out of it but it's there because it's now editing instead of create i'm gonna sign it try to find it yep not working it's only on this user as far as we know actually we signed one other bill because we did sign that other patients bill together sherry she logged in with the other user name of her and she was able to save and sign the other patient but this patient um but she couldn't there was two patients that she could not do this is being one of them and i asked her to keep this one not signed a while ago so that we can show it to you but it doesn't let her sign it the screen just kinda jumps a little bit and before it wasn't even letting me save it i could fill in all the you know the blanks if you will it wouldn't even let me save it any other user or do we have any other ones i well all i so the only people who have the rights to do the billing are me and me sometimes sharing quote my father there's no maneuver like the eye of the owner um so that has to do with the fact that i do all the billing stuff myself because i am just you know i i'm responsible for making sure the money gets accounted and that cash payments as well go into the account not into someone's pocket there's only one way for me to be sure of that because i really don't have time to be checking these things you know i'd rather just do it once rather than looking through i've had colleagues who have had you know a lot of money not make it into their practice accounts and then they get into trouble with the irs in addition to having been robbed so i don't want none of that so that's my father said that my father was a doctor one day when i was watching my mother laboriously do his books at home because it was all on paper then and i said how come mom does that instead of miss assessment her that was his secretary he said there's no maneuver like the eye of the owner so can we can we try to create a super folder for this one can we try to create an e super bill we could i don't really want to but we can because i'm not gonna bill her for it but we can always delete it so let's just do her last visit saving fine i just have to charge her a little something let's click on the same thing it just kind of alright rises up on the screen a little bit doesn't save as work either uh can you log in doctor i tried this on explore oh i never tried it on edge i tried it on explorer i didn't know i was allowed to go on edge am i allowed to go on edge yeah definately yeah why it says use chrome i'm trying to be a good person when i called that i have a problem you're gonna say in fact i should do this you're gonna say hey well you didn't use chrome alright so you have the control i always like the same issues same thing all right i can see like uh we can explore i used to be an explorer alright uh what i've noticed that uh when we create a new patient and you provider notes allowing us to you know create a super bill for that but the patients that already have a provider note and already have the e super bill we're unable to sign that so uh give me some time let me report this to our technical team alright i'm not even able to save it it's not only the signing because what i usually do my workflow here is a computer word is that i usually save it because when it's saved for some reason my office manager can print it out in the format that's understandable to the patients with the codes but if i saved and signed it she cannot i don't know why but i usually save it and then i signed it at a at a future time so yes those are the two things that are going on all right um i'm gonna try to come up with some work around in the meantime because i do need to keep making money and uh thank you both for uh coming to the phone i think i'm gonna revive that old user alright thank you doctor alright thank you bye bye bye

ticket that you wanted to know that if the claims are in the denial bucket and you want to ask that if it stays there or does it go anywhere right yeah we want to kind of because there was a few i've already fixed but they're still on the denial list so we were just trying to figure out if there if there's a way to get you can you can move the denial from the in process bucket to the uh sorry from the pending bucket to the in process bucket and after in process bucket once you post the payments against that denial either you can write it off or you can post the actual payments the denial will automatically be moved to the resolved bucket okay so thanks for okay so for example there was one in the denial for the diagnosis is inconsistent with the patient's age and it was just that it was he was a male patient but we accidentally had put the pregnancy test code in there which is why that was coming back and i fixed it but still there so how would i move that one can we do a screen share

patient's account this particular claim will be automatically moved to the resolved bucket you cannot manually add the claim to the resolved bucket these are the ones which automatically goes here so you can move into the in process because yeah that's all i really wanted to move i just needed to move it out of the denial so that works alright that's what i needed to know okay perfect nope that

that will work the best with curemd uh which scanner uh you believe in our opinion would work best right yes yeah so i purchased some in the past but i've noticed that they don't do duplex automatically and i'm having to put the page um is there a scanner and i saw on your website the scan jet pro 3000 well that do automatic duplex in where i only have to run the paper through one time i'll have to check that just give me one quick moment and that will be right back with you okay yeah i appreciate that thank you you're welcome thank you for holding uh are you having a scanner now i mean uh with what company is that yes so we i purchased let me see real quick in my orders give me one second here i believe it was yeah it was a cannon dr 1 40 and i would like to support a couple times and had people remote on but they said there's no way for us to use the automatic duplex feature and then we would have to take the sheet out flip it over and re scan it okay so so you believe that uh an automatic automatic duplex feature has to be in the printer the one that you want to use so i have that on the other printers it's just the support team from i've spoken to and they said that we were not able to do the automatic duplexing so i saw on your website the scan jet pro 3000 scanner is supported recommended by curemd and i just wanna double check and make sure that it will automatic duplex before i purchase it okay um alow me one quick moment okay yeah thank you you are welcome okay what i'm gonna do is that it will be connecting you with uh peter in the it department and will be uh able to assist you with this thank you yeah thank you i appreciate it you're welcome hello thank you so much for patiently holding the line this is peter how may i help you hey peter i hope you're doing well today i just got a quick question about um some scanners and their compatibility with curemd okay so i okay so i saw on the website that it is recommended to use the scan jet pro 3000 sheep scanner i just wanted to make sure that that scanner will do automatic duplexing and i don't have to flip the page uh when i do that because i purchased another scanner the canon dr 1 40 that supports duplexing but i still have to take the page out and flip it over um and i've tried to troubleshoot with here and be supported a couple times but they just say that's how it works alright so um if you don't mind can i connect into that computer to actually check the settings if it does scan um so i'm not actually physically one of those computers right now i'm just double checking to make sure but um can you confirm that the scan jet pro 3000 does do automatic duplexing it does but um i do have another scanner which is a fijitsu um scanner which is also a good option and i believe it's a bit better than the one that we recommend and that's also gonna work with a number of that yes it's fi 71607160 okay it does scan ids um insurance id driving licenses um documents from the front and back without even having the need of switching the paper okay um does the do that as well or just this one uh h p m does the same thing as well but um i think this candidate is much faster than that so that's why but you can get either of these whatever is available yeah yeah i just wanted to make sure that it was supported um you know we've been having with the other one i purchased and it just kinda crapped up but um if can i call back at a later date to troubleshoot the duplex scanning um sure definitely um you just put in a support ticket if possible otherwise it's called us again and uh whoever is available definitely be able to help you okay and then if you don't mind i have one more quick question for you sure um is the dymo label 4 50 still recommended or is there something else now that's the one that's what we recommend perfect okay i bought a couple of those so i just wanna make sure that'll work too alright i really appreciate your help thank you no

the united way of greater statement vna of saint louis how may i direct your call hello this is ben fisher calling from curemd may i please speak with amy sure hold on please in program this is amy hi amy this is ben fisher calling from curemd how are you doing today good i received this ticket of your saying that you would like to have the rendring provider's name included into the face sheet now can you tell me you're asking about the uh the the demographics of the patient right that when you print out the demographic it should have the name of the rendering provider associated there right correct i'd i'd like it to be on the face sheet when you print the demographic page and on the patient banner you know like the banner across the top yes we're currently currently it says pcp and referring provider it would be super nice if it said witch doctor in this practice treat them i understand but can you tell me what's your need for this like uh your does it confused people at the front desk to create an appointment for which provider or is it for something else well one we are not an office-based practice we're a home based practice so it's for all of us like our medical assistance when we get phone calls from patients or when we're scheduling patient when we're calling the patient to schedule a provider we were trying to remember which doctor saw them because uh we have a geriatric practice so think of it i was calling your grandma i know so right so think about if i was calling your grandma they remember the doctor they can't remember the nurse practitioner or you got to at least associated with two like then hi it's amy i'm calling to schedule doctor foxes nurse practitioner to come out and see you because they can't remember tammy right we gotta kind of and it would just really help if we knew which doctor was overseeing their care the patient care i see okay well a that uh the name of the rendering provider is uh can be added on the profile of the patient and it does appear on the print out as well however uh you do you know how does that appear well hold on just a second let me because i'm in a chart right now let me just do that let me hit save when i go to print the demographics uh can can we do remote session through any desk let me show you what i'm talking about oh i do see it i do see on the on the face sheet it says rendering provider that's right so if if that only happens if you know it is documented under the patient demographics however having the name of debate provider in the banner that is uh actually i mean you know the the name of the referring provider and the primary care provider that can be added onto the banner but for now we do not have the option for the refer the you know the the the provider who they are uh being seen by so for now that is not a problem however half of your concern is addressed okay i appreciate that well yeah so i would have you know i get that uh from what i understand i can't be the only one in the country that makes a request of the development team i totally i hope i'm not the only one i hope it's something that other people see value in otherwise my work around i already use the notes section i already the three the stoplight colors you know the green yellow and red but but why you have to ask well you have to add the name of the provider in in the patient notes i mean it's it's already there in the profile of the patient right well and now i i think that could solve a lot of our problems we just go back and add all of our old patients if we just go through and look it up once and like you said add it to the demographic page that's a good that's right also uh right at the end of the page you see the box for comments a comment section box so just in case if there is something uh which you do not find a place for or you want to document something which you're not able to figure out where should you put something and how should you develop the workflow and let everybody know the practice so that is a very good place to place something right i do that because i already do that because the demographic report is terrible because it only prints one contact emergency contact and it's never the right one if you put more than one like let's say they have a son a daughter and a spouse it doesn't print it print i can't figure out if it's the last one or the first one it's never the right one because it doesn't even matter if you change it to power of attorney which should have more weight and should always be the one that gets printed but it's software the software is smart enough to even do that it's the emergency contacts are useless because it doesn't print on the face sheet 1 1 of them will print but you might as well not have anybody that's not the the main one because it doesn't print them anyway or it's gonna print the wrong person so i have to spend the time in the comment box of adding all the contacts to the comment box so that they do print on the face sheet because again in our practice because we're a geriatric practice you almost never almost never called the patient directly we're always calling someone else child spouse somebody and we need to know who that is and even if you print the report so i spend a lot of do i spend a lot of time doing work around and i would love it if you guys cared enough to fix your demographic like in your updates uh man of course that's the you know this thing with you just mentioned about uh the the contact i totally understand that part uh you know where the contacts are actually very important and also that depends for some practices which are of different speciality that might not be a big deal for them but for you guys of course that is and of course not only the problem is i don't i still don't think that curemd understands the purpose of the demographic report the purpose of printing that out is when you're making a referral for a patient right so you're referring this patient to another health care service so it could be a home health company it could be a hospice company it could be an equipment company it could be another doctor it could be lots of things right and the most important information is many times missing right so you use the referrals like create the referrals and send over the referrals right i've not sent an outgoing referral i do i use the incoming referral to put in like an hmo patients okay you know like the if it requires an insurance referral but if i'm gonna do an outgoing referral what's the point of that uh well about on the left tree where it says referrals under registration you got it and and that's where you uh document incoming ones if you wanna let's say for your patient to anything else for something else uh so you can uh you know document a few information pieces over there and you know when you're gonna uploading documents or uh if there are any diagnosis codes or cpt codes you wanna document there you can do that too and you can you know just print out a sort of report that will be that will have some uh basic information of the patient which might be required by the other party you're uh sending over the patient too but again that depends of course who you're sending it to and for what uh but just to just are you telling me i can attach a face sheet to that outgoing um you can attach a face sheet as well you can just download you know you print like download this report and then you can upload it with the referral and when you will print out the referral as a whole that will become the part of uh the referral as well because what we're currently doing is printing out either printing or faxing the demographic page because you can fax it right from curemd uh the problem is the reason we have to print it is because the missing information has to be corrected um and then we have to print out the providers visit note and assigned prescription usually so um the outgoing referral and it doesn't allow you to attach things from within curemd i mean i get how you can put diagnosis from there you know i get that but it doesn't let you attach a provider note a visit note from our inside our practice uh well if you uh run a report to provide a note and downloaded onto the computer and when you're creating this referral so you can upload it as a document with the referral and when you're gonna printing out i'm i'm sorry i'm i'm just working from home so okay so uh you know when you print this report out uh you can just you know get the whole report and that will have the documents associated so that you won't have to you know separately send each information uh in the fax you can just send it one fax and that will be a whole document you want me to show you what i'm talking about i think so because i'm not convinced that that's faster than what we're doing because but i wanna see maybe i'm wrong maybe uh yeah let me opem any desk real quick sure let me okay here we go and just from my knowledge when you're referring to whoever you refer to uh what what pieces of information would you need provider notes uh contact i mean demographics precisely and what else a script and order script and orders okay and orders you know so a prescription right many right many times what we're order what we're ordering or referring requires a doctor's order a providers order and i'm not aware and so correct me if i'm wrong if there's any way we can i know how to e prescribe the medicine but there's not a signed script pad you know in here like for us to if the doctor gives us orders to do something right they gotta send their doctor right now we're filling out their signed script and faxing it with manually faxing it with the face sheet and their provider note uh let's let's remote session let me show you what options we have it's 251 296 404 thank you i'm sending you the request please accept once you receive it amy are you the office manager perfect that would be great to share this information with you so that just in case if you need to start using this workflow you may i'm gonna i can see your screen now may i take control of your computer yep alright so let's bring up curemd here yep so on screen 2 let me cancel it here okay so there are multiple things which you can uh print out and uh you can share with you know other uh providers or whoever you refer to but this is uh this is called clinical over review it has got you know some allergies details a diagnosis complaint history and here is the medication list if you wanna rip pull up a report so that's where you know uh it shows your details here so you wanna uh patient information and all that stuff over here i'm gonna hit this okay and this is a you know a summery of report which got a lot of information already from the uh from the details of a patient where the cancer you know probably you won't even have to share the provider note details if this is all what is uh precisely the information of the patient right if if any way you need to share the provider notes you can do that too i'll show you where can you get a whole report from the you know provider notes as well so this is something which must be helpful for you uh you can also just download this one and you go to demographics oh sorry the referrals and when i'm i don't wanna use this real patient let's pull up test patient so what you do is let's say it's an outgoing referral your document effective date let's say it's for i'm gonna use the same thing maybe you're gonna do 25 to 22 alright sure for a year sure and uh let's get this now that's where you are gonna be documenting who is being referred by i'm just selecting any random provider who the patient is being referred to once again i'm selecting a random provider and how many ways it's you know you can just document five or something sorry actually okay now whatever the status of this is uh if completed it is other it is in progress whatever uh if if you want to assign it to somebody to follow up hold on i wanna try something sure okay okay and uh where you put up a reason here if there was any referral number otherwise just whatever works for you guys you add the diagnosis from here let's say i'm just selecting any random just to demonstrate and and the procedures you would select one here and you can add more so i just added two for now and uh i'm just gonna hit save here okay with that i mean plan will appear here as well but for now we're just proceeding like that and that's where you can attach the appointments as well and here you can upload the documents if your providers are using uh direct you could simply upload every detail of the patient what you have into the system but uh if you're not so that's that's all right summary of here is you know uh the complete detail as you know so uh here the documents can be uploaded simply or scan into this why would you upload a document that already exists within curemd i wanna attach a document essentially right that's that's actually where uh you know there's limitations which is being worked on right now and uh our product team is working on this to uh actually they're trying to revamp the whole referral system but for now i'll just do it let you know that we are uh you know you can do this one and when you're gonna let me just save here and did i save that i did i guess okay and when you're going to send this this then then it lets you fax okay yes so it will create the sort of report over here and it will have all the details and the documents associated and everything so this report which is attached here that is actually a detailed report which includes everything off the procedure codes diagnosis code provider notes whatever your documents uploaded documents and all that so it will be one document which is being sent over to the other patients to the other provider or wherever the patient is being referred to so that's that's something which you can use it i mean you can of course try and test it if it works for you guys so you can right so here's what i need you so i i see what you're saying it's just i might as well i might as well keep doing the process that we're already using and here's what we're doing right we had to we have to manually fill out a face sheet so about a patient so in this case i try i was trying to test uh to see if i could do this electronically with what you were doing here so memory care home solutions is uh a dementia and alzheimer's resource so i do have them loaded in our uh what do you call it you're referring providers list so when you do referred to right not all of them are doctors i've the work around again is i've had i've added all the home health companies that we use i've added hospital medical record departments and things like that to so that they come up in that list with their fax numbers but because i can't attach a prescription and our uh so here like i got a cover letter here's the here i have your face sheets you still don't there still is not a way to brand them so i have to print out a sticker and slap at the top of a demographics so it tells who are practice is in this case i was not aware that the rendering provider would be on here so that was also part of why i wanted it branded and let me see then same for this one the one contact i do have is the correct contact but down here in the comments box is really how i give make sure that whoever is on the receiving end gets the correct information uh here's the the provider note right because they often need to know what the physician documented and we're very research based so they want to know what the conversation with the patient was what the physician they want their whole provider note they wanna know what the doctor said or the nurse practitioner alright so and then i faxed it this is my fax confirmation letter but this is our every day with because your software doesn't allow us to to send the provider note with uh script and a cover letter and the face sheet like otherwise i have to do it separately i can fax the face sheet directly and tell them whatever is missing i can fax the provider note separately but i still have to manually write out a prescription you know i have signed prescriptions from each provider here in the office because if they're not in the office and then they send us a message to say order this do that then there's not an electric paperless way for us to do that with curemd right well as as i showed you about the uh clinical summary report that would be quite helpful to you in this matter not really because like for example the home health company and the equipment companies they wanna see that that position documented medical necessity that's not necessarily a diagnosis or besides the diagnosis they want deep read that they are short of breath with exertion that they are unable to perform without help that they are bed bound wheelchair bound those are things that are not diagnosis right those those are the painting the picture of how this patient documenting what's going on with the patient does that make sense the providers note is the only way because otherwise it would be amy saying oh the patient is this or that right they they want to see the signed provider note from the sure physician the nurse practitioner sure so there's another report which you can use over here under uh reports under ehr you have provider notes instead of finding out each provider note separately you can just bring up all the provider notes of one patient at the same time uh do you have any patient's name on the top of your head um sure because we're right so this is the list of all to provide a notes of this patient right if you want to select this all of them you could do that if you want to let's say skip a few you you could remove them and other you can print them all or only the selected ones so let me show you by printing them all how does it look like it actually gives you the list everything whatever is documented ever in the provider notes so i mean i understand it's gonna be a lot of information there uh but that's that's everything what has ever been documented on the provider note and instead of you know pulling up each provider note separately you can just simply get this report faxed or emails or however you like it okay alright that's that's easier instead of getting each provider note and you're concerned about uh you know we're as i mentioned we're definitely gonna look into that uh there you can document the provider's name into the profile of the patient under the demographic it gives you the name on the report as well however uh you know for now uh like that's what you can do is yes it it might not appear on the banner for now but we are definitely gonna consider your uh suggestion about that and let's see if we i mean we you know now that the name of the providers referring provider and the primary care provider is there is because of course this you know suggestions and maybe it was internal external i'm not sure but you know so so we of course uh appreciate the suggestions and we look into that uh that that might depend that how long would it take for a particular thing to work on and get developed and have it installed into the into the system and also that you know how important part is and how much uh how many you know practices are facing the problem with that so we are definitely gonna look into that alright however referring uh the the rendring provider can be added onto the profile of the patient alright amy i hope today's session was a little more helpful in in a few things maybe yeah i do appreciate it not a problem anything else for now i can assist you with no that's it thank you thanks for updating appreciate it no problem i'm gonna get include the ticket however uh we're gonna look into your concern about the the name of the provider into the banner alright okay thanks thank you you're welcome have a good day good bye you too bye bye"}}, {"id": 643, "data": {"call_id": "1622657968.125249.txt", "text":

the patient's progress notes access on CureMD could you help me with that sure um alright it's patient progress notes uh could you please tell me the name of the practice you're calling from yeah it's lawrenson heart institute just give me one quick moment um it's with us under the name um lawrenson heart specialists right yeah hillside avenue right mhm okay uh just one moment what was your first name again i'm sorry syeda s y e d a s y e d a okay and what's your role in the practice associate medical assistant medical assistant right okay it's uh your last name is rizvi yes r i z v i okay syeda do you have anydesk application on your computer so you can show me any what anydesk that's a screen sharing software do you have teams uh we do but we we actually cannot share screens on teams um you can download that i mean what you can do is that you can go on google chrome and type any desk dot com okay let me actually see if i have it anydesk okay yeah let me go to google first for that sure okay should i do download now yes okay but er yeah it's done alright once you open it will give you a nine digit number that you need to share with me okay um yeah it's 963 881 058 i'm sending you a request okay accepted it hello yes i'm here could you please take me to your screen the application okay um one second yeah the screen can you see it yes i can okay so when i go to i had to actually use the are you sure you're using the diagnostic code so i was asked to go to reports and then go to the patients go to search um new mm and then will select all the active patients and diagnosis and put the diagnosis code i'm trying to look for ingina okay so what should i click after this i want to see all the patients who who have this diagnostic code well um one thing syeda is that whenever you're using the CureMD application everything that's written in blue is clickable okay so once you you hit here that's gonna be where is that come on okay so the i s d is icd i'm sorry is is saved down here right and um another thing is that these criterias are separately treated so you don't need to uh i mean select anything in the profile if you're using this one right okay so these are six separate criteria i have a question that i i only need access to the active patients so i don't have to do because the the guy before you told me to click active in order to have access to all the active patients not the previous passed on patients okay so you could pick current from the status thing i mean so you'll be using only this window once you're once you're using this you're only using this okay alright and uh custom fields is not going to be a part as well so you would have to run this report could you go to the first patient and show me if i can see the doctor's note yeah so this is what i'm getting and i'm i'm actually expecting to get the entire progress no doctor's note um how do i see that for the patient okay well now for this particular diagnosis because this is the report section so uh i believe it it does not exactly allow you to go into that patient for that particular note okay um what could be done alright thats fine yeah what is it yeah go ahead i'm just thinking of something that could that could make it a little better for you because in reports normally i mean what we see right now on the screen this is this is it right you can only while exporting it you can only change this i mean if you want a summary report that changes the uh the headers a little i mean this report and when it's unchecked are gonna be slightly different um so that's the only thing how about this that uhuh if i if i exported to all these patients and then one by one through the date of birth i search them individually would that work that would work that would for sure work i mean even yes after after exporting this you could you could do it manually i mean that's what could be done i mean you would have the list of the patients but again for going in their notes you would have to do it manually okay so can you demonstrate um let's say if i use one of the date of birth to go into the patient notes sure could you please deal with this do you want me to click yes i don't know the file you're trying to open is in a different format and specified by the file extension verify that the file is not it's not now what you can do is yeah i need the patients date of birth exactly so that i can access uhm the particular patients note so account number won't work let's try that okay let's try that i mean you'll do it exactly the way you do it uh while you're doing it for a patient i mean any of the patients okay you going in the list of the provider notes now um okay anyone that you want alright so then i can okay the second one is fine follow up and uh doctor one question have you logged a ticket for this question have i had a ticket for this question mhm no i called you and um i don't have a ticket or anything they didn't give me a number or anything no problem probably for the last call okay no problem i'm i'm gonna be uh logging a ticket from your screen okay and just in case in the future you have any of such uh questions you could simply log a support ticket and someone from the right department will be getting back to you on this i mean whatever the concern is right all the tickets that you've logged and whatever the status is updated comes in this my tickets tab right and for logging a ticket you hit this and you put a subject for now i'm putting it's really it comes to me and uh how do the pull particular patient if there is anything that you want to add uh for instance a list of patients or a document that you want to share with the ticket you could drag and drop it over here okay alright you could tell what's the best time to reach you and could you please put your email address over here sure okay perfect and whenever you log in a ticket please make sure that you have the right email address and the contact number down here okay now once uh such a ticket is locked you get a ticket number and that ticket comes in the queue and then reaches the right department uh i mean the relevant department someone from the relevant department will be getting back to you and then it's their responsibility to update the ticket on uh the status right sure alright one moment i'll be picking the ticket number once it's done anything else i can help you with doctor no that's fine thank you so much you're welcome you have a very good day okay bye bye bye"}}, {"id": 655, "data": {"call_id": "1622668328.1257699.txt", "text": "sherry hale extension 1049 sherry how can i help you hi sherry this is ben fisher calling from curem d how are you doing today hey good how about you i'm good thank you so much i received this ticket of yours for for simon that doctors providers actually no it was wrote by another user so i i saw the picture you have a task i can see that there is no law for any other users who actually access the that particular provider note however i could see that actually so many users and the practice do have the access to be able to revoke access if somebody else is uh you know using this uh you know provider note or is working on so don't you think it should be taken away from all the users um well so they have that feature already checked in the settings that says um god i don't remember the wording but basically revoke basically yeah one person at a time so that if she's in it and she's doing something and um she goes to save the note from what i'm understanding from the client um then that message will pop up sometimes and usually my understanding of that feature is that if she's already in it then nobody else should be able to get in it to do anything at all so are you yeah so that's where i'm like well it doesn't look like somebody else was in it um at the time that she was in it so it let me explain you know that let me explain you how it works so first the practice setting under settings must be that the the you know which is already text that is restrict access to currently open provider note which means that if that access is checked it means that i know of the user will be able to access any provider note which is being worked on to by another user so let's see i'm working on some provider note if you're trying to access it the system will tell you that you know this note is being used by you know ben fisher so you cannot access it okay now in in user settings there is another additional thing which was added for a particularly the office managers and the providers so that in case they need to access a provider note they i mean you know they don't want to read that message that you cannot access their the providers right so for them there is an access which uh you know if it is a check which means that if a provider wants to access that uh that particular provider note with somebody else is working on to they can but for now i can see almost all the users have this access that where is this access because i've never heard of this you just open up any uh user there okay and uh if you go to the permissions you scroll down and under provider note uh actually that is under patient you would or you can just simply do control f and find revoke provider note access you just write revoke and fill appear there oh so it is a new thing okay so if that is check marked what will happen so that person can just get into any note that they want your got it that is right so let's say i'm into the profile of anthony author now this user if has the access to be able to revoke note it means that no matter the practice white setting is that no must no one must be able to access anybody else's provider note but this user which is anthony author will be able to access to provider note off another user you know that will be forcefully because this user is an authoritative user and needs to provide a note more importantly than any other user so but for now so okay i get that part but now so tell me then what am i gonna tell her about this log that she pulled where it doesn't show anybody else doing anything right well for that one i was only assuming that maybe it was not the patient or maybe there was some other patient uh but i can see that the patient patient mm hm uh i can see that there are no logs and i even checked that if any other user access that patient or edit any information but i don't see any so that one we can investigate but i can see that if if that might have happened that can happen because almost all the users do you have the access to be able to revoke to provider note if it is being worked on by somebody else so the first thing is that it should be taken off only the providers may have this access so that they may be able to access to provider note even though if a nurse or medical assistance is breaking on that one and that also ask for the permission if you want to or you don't want to if they say that they don't want to and not interrupt the other user let them do whatever they want to do so they can just decline that as well so for the other pot why did this happen to on that particular patient we can investigate on it from the back end uh if you want me to do that or put in the request because she's yeah because here's the thing that uh you know she pulled that audit log herself so she sent it to me after i said well is it possible that maybe in m a or somebody was still doing something in the note and she didn't know and you know was in it and tried to save and sign or whatever and and that's how this happened and she said well uh she sent me back that picture of the log and she said well she goes unless i'm missing something there's nobody in there but her and i'm like yeah okay because some of these providers at um simon a couple of things one some of them do see patients from their home like they're on their computer because their therapists and stuff like that so it's not like they have to do you know blood pressures and all this stuff so sometimes these providers are working from home and they use a different service for telemedicine so she might have been doing that or sometimes these therapist call their own patient back because again they're not doing things like their weight and blood pressure and all this stuff because they're a psychiatry type group so a lot of times they just call their own patient back and bring them back there they even schedule patients they know how to do a lot of stuff these providers do so um i don't know that you know because she she never said that there was anybody else like an m a or something working with this particular provider to help her do stuff but it could have been i don't know but according to what we're seeing on that that log it's just showing her in there and that's it nobody else as far as the note part goes i mean i can just try and get by it and see if you know she doesn't say anything about it um but she may ask me so then why does the log show this and it still gave her that message if there was nobody in it i can try and see if she'll just take the answer and go but she she may say to me but how did this happen i totally understand i mean i'm still gonna talk to her and and let her know hey you know because that's something i didn't even know was there so it must be pretty new that that revoke thing right there in the uh the accounts of the um users because i've never seen that before or maybe i just didn't notice it i don't know but um i you know i'm gonna still tell her and just say hey look this is how you can take this away um if you want to do that because the only place i ever knew of it being was just under the practice settings and that was it i never knew that it was in that spot too right well i right i am going to take a look into this if we can somehow i'm actually going through this whole report a while we're speaking to see uh what what could have happened then if i can find any other log in that matter however you you just for now tell her that if if she's complaining about this that this happened her access to that particular note was revote this can happen because everybody at the practice has access to to be able to revoke the note which can be taken off why does it not show the name of the user who did this that that we're an investigate on alright alright well let me know what you find out i'm not gonna call her tonight because they're already closed anyway and i'm getting ready to leave here in about five minutes i'm gonna talk to her tomorrow about it okay alright thank you no problem have a good one goodbye"}}, {"id": 656, "data": {"call_id":

another line let me see um hold on okay no problem she is on another line is there a direct do you have a direct number she can call you right back she's talking to the insurance company um i'm calling in regards of a support ticket that she created um and i do have an extension um but i don't mind holding on the line for a few minutes if you think she would be done in another few minutes sure sure we can try that all right thank you no problem here it's the light fm i'm happy to be with you today i'm trisa it's all about hope if you are struggling to find hope today i want to encourage you with a very special podcast to speak with mike stolen from an organization called behold israel can you share with us how we can see god's word coming alive today processing from the bible being fulfilled and you can see it in the headlines it's not scary it's exciting when you see what's happening through the window of god's word and what we can look forward to next you're gonna find hope i'd love to send you this podcast i'll do it right now if you text the word podcast to 802 93 oh 69 just text podcasts to 802 931069 sure you don't mind holding continue to hold it no problem alright uh one more thing is the office manager available because she's requesting to change a practice settings for which i would be requiring the consent of the office manager so if i can take the consent in the meantime when she's already talking on the phone so it will be convenient for me you hold on just a second let me check okay sure thank you hold on you're welcome hey so you need my uh permission is this about the uh the get the uh what is this about that ticket she's saying about us getting that message no uh she sent a support ticket where the inactive patients are being included in the search results and she wanted to change the settings to pull up only active patients so this is a setting that we can do from the practice configurations no we don't want we do want to pull up inactive patients but i think she was wrong there is a possibility of searching for an active patients as well i mean normally if you're searching for patients normally well let me explain to you what we're wanting to do i'm sorry because i know you're misunderstanding because i talked to her about it we're not it's not inactive versus active it's in current is the word instead of inactive so current like when we search for insurance is when we go to the patient head and we search for say blue cross it is pulling up if the if any patient in the whole how many every years we've had curemd ever had blue cross we wanted to pull up current blue cross patients not if they had it i'll go over here not if they had it you know at another time alright so can you please define what would be the meaning of current patients current what defined current current is present right now like currently like who has blue cross right now who didn't have it not because some people had it three years ago but they don't have it right now we want to know who currently has these insurances current as in right now not if they had what insurance they have at the moment does that make sense yes am i speaking with tyra uh huh yes all right tyra can i put you on a brief hold and uh reconfirm this on my end please yeah because it didn't have to do with active and inactive patients she when she was we were talking about insurances that are active that are currently active when we search for insurance plans we wanna only pull up what is active the patients that actively have a certain type of plan does that make sense right is it conveniently possible for you to do a remote session so that we can figure that out together it will be anydesk i'm gonna let her do that hold on one second i mean this for a prayer guide to help you show them little patients find some fruit of the spirit for your life interesting this is donna how are you doing today hi donna this is colin from curemd i'm doing fine how about yourself just fine am i waiting to do anydesk yes please so that i can show you what options do we have we thought we were going to have to uh call and fuss about cure md none of us could get on earlier this morning for some reason this is not cooperating with me bear with me no problem i am right here okay i'm uh this is not helping here let's see goodness gracious this is just not working for me for some reason no problem alright uh what tyra has told me that is if you're searching for a plan both the patients inactive and active patients appear and what she confirmed me is that she wants the active patients who currently have that plan associated to them and as for my experience if the account is active and it's falling under that plan only then it should appear there is a way in the practice settings where we can exclude the inactive patients from the search results if we do so only the active patients would appear in the search results and those active patients should have that plan associated to their profile okay alright so if you cannot access that let me show you the workflow can you go to the settings icon that's the extreme right wheel sort of an icon okay alright now on the left hand side you see four options practice ehr billing and report is that correct it is all right if you click on the plus icon that is on the left hand side of practice the second option should be my practice settings okay do you see a plus icon on the left hand side of my practice settings uh no alright alright so mhm alright from my end i am turning off the include inactive patients for the time being if this resolve your issue that will be good if this does not resolve your issue then we will see what we can do about that so i have saved the settings can you please search for the patients now and see if it if it pulls up the required results okay let me just look at a few of them and see sure uh no the first one i clicked on he did have blue cross in the past but he has aetna now so it i just went to blue cross and see so yeah it must still be pulling up um okay i know the problem is it takes so long for you to check them mhm that's correct alright insurance give me one moment let me see if there's a specific report available for that donna can i put you on a brief hold please and confirm this one minute i'll be right back donna thank you so very much for holding on the line i have confirmed this on my end from the patient search where you're searching for patients it is not possible however in the report there is a search report from where you can search the plans with active patients only okay so sure if you go to the third last option that is report okay on the left hand side there is an there's a tab patient under the outstanding balance if you click on the plus the second option is by plan okay so if you hit by plan so you see the status it is active and inactive or all so if you click on the active plan and uh give out the range or if you do not want to give out the range if you can you know select the plan from the very first field uh then it will only pull up the patients with active uh insurance plan of that category okay so i chose blue cross blue mhm sure mhm and then i hit print print mhm and the one that will show you you can you know generate or you can just save this information uh by clicking on the arrow button on the right to download this file okay alright okay so this is uh this is a better way of searching for patients pipeline these are all active patients um i think alright well thank you no problem my pleasure and donna is there anything else i can help you with and do you allow me to go ahead and close the support ticket that'll be fine all right thank you so very much for your consent and for your time and have a wonderful day bye alright thank you bye"}}, {"id": 657, "data": {"call_id": "1620326160.754607.txt", "text": "thank you for calling curemd this is rick

fecho he's still alive he still has a schedule up i'm gonna do the same thing for the 25th on on friday the 25th he still has a schedule alive as do i mhm so these schedules on the 21st and the 25th

go to the second he's still there he's not supposed to be here i'm still here that's good when we go to the uh the fifth that's an off day so here we are that one's fine because that's not a normal day we go to the seventh he's still on that needs to be turned off i'm still on that's good on the ninth i'm on he's on so his schedule for bristow has not been turned off alright no problem let me take care of that right away okay and then when we go to my off section so i'm supposed to be off here but this is and okay so that that worked there on wednesday the 21st i'm off he's on good on the 23rd he's on i should be off okay on the 26th i'm off he's on great on the 28th he's on i'm off awesome and on the 30th i'm off he's on okay on the second excellent and i'm off on the fourth i'm off

confirm me it will take just a moment so doctor fecho needs to be off on give me one moment let's do that right away so this is the block schedule alright and the the issue is with the bristol location or the bristol location alright and what would be the date for which he needs to be turned off june 21st uh june 21 till the 20 he needs to be completely turned off from june 21st through july nine july 9th alright uh alright i have done that can you please uh refresh and check now june 21 until july nine it's completely off for doctor fecho now okay um and can you just please verify one more time if there's any other change that is required so that i can do that when i have you on the phone so the other change which has which is different than that needs to be done from so let me just see something here okay so we have both of us open here can you let me just go back and check saturdays sure so you have a curemd has us both open on saturdays after this point so starting july 24 mhm on you have us both on so one second let me go back even before that just to make sure yes that's doctor jason 26 good okay no alright i would just like to inform you one thing that i had to adjust few of the blocks which were available until the end of the year and because of the reason that these blocks needs to be adjusted for the vacation time period so i had to adjust that so if there is any other day uh after your vacations that you wanna block you can let me know and i will block them accordingly so i had to what did you have to change for the rest of the year uh there were a few blocks in your scheduler which were till the end of the year this year that we are currently in so because of the reason that you had to change those uh days on for either of you so i had to adjust those blocks to make that day available for either of you so that's the reason why after your vacations there might be a few days that you had blocked earlier but would now be available so you can confirm me that and i will block them again as per your requirement so don't worry about that okay so after your vacation time period okay so starting august 14th can you make august 14 a doctor wise saturday uh this would be a block well so it's not gonna be a block so the 14th is going to be a doctor wise and then we're gonna alternate every other saturday from there so for instance starting august 14th that'll be for doctor wise the 21st would be doctor fecho the 28th would be doctor wise the september 4th would be doctor fecho 11th would be doctor wise the 18th would be doctor fecho can we do that yes we definitely can do that give me one moment let me do that right away uh let me first put you alright the 14 is on for you yep alright so let's do that alright so that is august 14 and this is green till the end of the year yes and then we'll adjust it as we need to as we go along sure and uh all right i get that so alright i have made your block if you can verify if

in while i was on the phone with you to reject it and all the ones that were in there that we were having issues with her no longer in there so i don't know if it's because they're working on them i uh i submitted them to see if maybe it's just to see if they had fixed it i don't know actualluy the thing is they will be submitting few test claims so they would know like what happened if they accept or reject so this is why i believe it's under the test so i will actually ask phil as well to give an update on this by updating the ticket uh just give you a call back and we'll see how it goes okay okay and while i have you on the phone can i just there's one other um patient and the rejected and it's coming back as the humana id number is incorrect but it is correct so i don't know why it's still kicking out sure no problem we will look into this right now give me one moment can we share screen do you have anydesk yeah let me let me do that real quick thank you i appreciate it i know you're busy no problem um let's see here okay i was gonna say i thought i had it up here so that's give me just a second sure okay the address is 271 074748 sending a request please accept okay sorry i had to put in another password okay and then let me take you to do you want me to go to where it is or even okay thank you alright let me look me um in a little bit that's too much let me check this medicare is pretty i didn't see that one in there before so um you're getting the rejections from aetna right no the one that i was actually talking about i haven't even looked at the aetna one or that blue cross one either i'm not sure why those there or the medicare right now let's go to the rejected buucket at first oh okay that's why i was like okay then i thought we were rejected i'm like oh no these are fine because aarp is gonna be a crossover so i'm not really concerned about putting that in and we already we have an issue with a ameri group and medicaid so it's just bottom ones that judy practical or practical i'm not sure how to pronounce it it says that her id is invalid but it's not and there's two claims under there i understand that let me see another judy it says subscribers subscriber id missing or invalid and this is that for humana we have two claims only and let's go to the appointment yeah it's just claims so um do i'm the eligibility before you submit the claim to the insurance yeah so everything is good on that so i don't know why it's coming back like that alright let's see acknowledgement mm that's weird they have rejected first and they acknowledge them afterwards did you call the insurance for this problem because they were rejecting one more time and then they're accepting it no i haven't i haven't called them i think i raised i may have resubmitted i'm not sure now because i would have had to go through the rejected so i haven't yet hm eligibility is working perfectly fine and no it says it's not um hm well yeah it's just 5 7 but the claims were from maybe because the do you have a card for this patient no we never get a card actually comes to the hospital so we never have a card on file is a face face i will actually request you to check the eligibility first by contacting humana their main ivr or the insurance representative so you have an understanding like if this policy is actually active under humana so after that like we will be actually look into this further you can just put it on ticket and uh maybe you need to actually get the policy check on the portal so you will have an idea like yes it's an active policy so we can work on it well when you just ran it you ran it for today's date correct so maybe if we go back from 19 of 2021 it'll come up eligible because maybe she's just not because as far as i know she you wanna go for one nine jan one yeah january 1 yeah this has been their old see this still okay oh no because we did a yeah that's fine okay well i'll contact insurance and find out thank you we will be waiting for your response just log in your ticket and as soon as you have an eligibility check on their end so we'll look into this further thank you i appreciate it thank you no

box of pulled up i select my a template which is letter for receipt of payment and i create and this is for the problem lies i have nothing okay everything seems to be fine at my end the only problem is that i need to show it to you so again um that brings me back to the same question is there anyone who could help you out um in putting in or installing any desk on the computer hold on a minute

out okay one second yes you can see your screen now so just tell him thank you thank you very much i finally get to see your screen now um let's just go over okay okay so this is what's not printing out so let's just go to search results we have three okay so so the reason it's not printing it out is just a moment is because we did not even choose any of these reports so all we'll do is we'll just click all these and then and then we'll print it and then we'll get a report okay nope okay pr 100 recovery letter because i'm supposed to go to all it's it's the pr 100 recovery letter itself i see nothing uh so what which template did you want to use letter for receipt payments and we'll go to create and then herself but i think we chose um in the adjustment detail patient responsibility letters okay just a moment letters for the payment seats right yes it's going to be somewhere over there is there any specific code for that i've been doing this for a year and i never had this problem before just a moment so let's go 38 have a way to the code i've never played with that okay i just need to look at one thing okay we have the patient account payment plan day users pay transfer adjustment and reason now when we look at this template letter for received a payment see the template is there wouldn't okay let's just see that on um i can you please log into your i can't get in that way is it not allowing you oh no we wanted to try it on internet explorer yeah i don't go in this way i haven't used this in so long i don't even know what my password is i go in another way why would it not let us read the report just a moment yeah i mean i i use it every day what windows are you using i suppose it's windows 10 pardon me uh is that windows 10 that you're using i honestly don't know okay just a moment let's just go over it one more time all we gotta do is remove some of the history cliche okay is this the one let's just do it one more time i need to close it um log in i know i go to my reports adjustment detail code don't give him no um-hum let's see if it's just a glitch or we can try to print it no it's not that's nothing alright um what i can suggest

other day i was having trouble with my um computer it just was blocked i couldn't see my documents so i called and they switched me to chrome from my desk curemd and i'm on a computer so now when i try to send a document over to my desktop from a patient's chart it won't it won't go okay um i'm really sorry to hear about that so and you mentioned that uh this recently just started happening and you did make the switch over to chrome and it's still happening and is this uh specifically just well the only thing happening the only thing happening let me just look and make sure let me look at somebody's okay document awesome uh i just wanted to get a more clear picture so uh when you say it's happening with the document manager right so is that the only module you're facing a problem in or yes that's the only thing like before it wouldn't pull up on the other side of documents like i couldn't open it up the documents and so he put me on chrome and so now uh when i go into messaging messages and i try to uh put the patients um like he wants his so i go and messages and then i put it on my desktop and then browse okay it won't go on my desktop okay mhm okay so um just have a question for you robin so by any chance did you log a ticket for this or is this the first time you're calling in regarding this concern this concern yes okay perfect because i work part time and so it's hard to get me a call i definitely understand that yeah it's pretty hard to squeeze in time when you have a busy schedule throughout the day yeah and i i work part time and i work at home so i can definitely understand understand that i've been there so uh if you're currently logged into your uh database robin what i would suggest is if you can log a ticket here because uh what that will actually do is as soon as you log that ticket in it goes into our queue so uh currently in our department we do have specialists who are more well trained into the document manager and those kind of fields so if you log that ticket in and if you uh provide me the ticket number we can have that uh assigned to somebody and they can assist you with this right now because i personally i'm not the most well trained in the document manager field so i can do the basic troubleshooting with you which i would love to do right now but for further on if there might be anything else happening i would personally love to have somebody more experienced to assist you with that yeah okay do you want me to go on and do that then yeah i can actually guide you through that by any chance do you have any desk installed on your desktop so we can share our screens i can i can log a ticket i know how to do that okay awesome so um okay you can do that and awesome as soon as you do that uh somebody will definitely reach out to you regarding that you can as well as uh just so i can assist you more on this uh as if you can log that in right now and if you can provide me the ticket number i can actually forward that over into our team and we can have that assigned right away for you okay it'll take me a minute but i've got to fill it all i've got two minutes it's completely alright okay hold i'll put you on hold and i'm gonna fill this out not a problem at all robin uh would i put a patient would that be it uh okay just one second uh let me just confirm that for you critical of the clinical that's what yeah that that that sounds i didn't say that right about accurate um major major okay let me hold on not a problem well let me scroll down so um okay uh you can get awesome um okay when i hit or click to drop your files here or click to upload it went to my um i guess it's like my desktop whatever my files okay so you want to cancel that uh okay so are you so you're attaching something with the ticket uh for the ticket right so it's not letting you are you're getting an error with that yeah let's see hold on see okay once i filled it out then it says attachment drop your files or click upload but it won't let me um pull it down anymore i can't look at the bottom of it okay alright so uh how about this robin so uh if you can just uh leave everything on the ticket screen as it is uh we'll get into that uh if you wouldn't mind opening up your any desk because i would actually love to kinda walk you through this and as well as i'll try my best to resolve your concern maybe i with the help of my colleagues we can actually do this over the phone as well so i would just wanna give it all that i've got a meeting to say so uh if you wouldn't mind sharing your any desk number whenever you open that up uh i can definitely start taking the control over and helping you out okay do you want me to say this uh yeah so you can uh you can just keep uh the page open as it is because you mentioned that it's not letting you scroll down and something's acting up so when we any desk i can actually i would love to see what's happening so i can kind of help you with that as well so it's any desk okay okay i'm on any desk now awesome so uh as soon as he opened it robin uh did you get that 9-digit code it says download now oh so you haven't downloaded it okay i didn't know that so i did use it the other day you did uh okay was that on the same desktop or laptop the same laptop because he came in and helped me hold on okay alright awesome please enter the address of your remote desk you would like to ex excess yeah so uh right there you can uh when you open the app itself you can see there will be an option on the top left that says this desk and you'll see a nine digit code right and put that in there if you wouldn't mind uh dictating that code to me so i can actually see your screen 891663409 perfect and in just a few moments robin you'll get a prompt to share your screen if you wouldn't mind just clicking yes for me okay accept perfect awesome so uh first of all robin uh before i start troubleshooting your scanning utility concern can i please see the login ticket screen that you had an issue with okay let me get out of this okay not a problem uh because i just wanted to make sure because logging a ticket is something you might use a lot so if you're getting that area it's not a good thing i think i lost it i lost it really but i can do it again oh not a problem not a problem uh if you wouldn't mind yes uh i just wanted to see if you're facing that uh inconvenience again okay mhm see it won't let me go down there okay let's see yeah sometimes it glitches up a little bit it it happens now let me go up i swear that's the things about machines like they're just not as reliable when you need them to be i guess okay let me just do this again unable to send documents to desktop from curemd okay and let me just um copy that description okay now i need to go down it's just not coming down uh well you can actually uh use the direction keys on your keypad that actually works too if you if you hit the down arrow key it might scroll down as well okay where is that i don't ever use that uh so if you uh so your laptop mouse pad if you just click it as you were to click it uh as a mouse button so and then if you press that little arrows that forward back left and right that you see on the laptop you can actually use that to scroll up and down as well i don't see it up and down oh wait there it is got a piece of dirt that's completely alright there it goes okay that's like an easy way to navigate if you were ever submit and you submit it yes uh definitely you can hit submit at the bottom taking so long i have no idea uh is it okay robin if i can take the controls try to submit it uh on my on your behalf perfect i just wanted to see if this 00 that seems to be i said this will be you you absolutely did i did see that i have a question okay let's go with questions and hopefully this will go through and make our life easier awesome that did go through awesome so that's your ticket number what i will do is robin let me write it down and awesome so we have that documented which is amazing now robin relating what you called in for regarding the scanner uh utility issue if you can just replicate that for me one more time what you were doing and what was popping up i think i can try my best to maybe fix that over the phone with the help of my colleagues okay sure okay so what i wanted to do let's go to a document um the patient so you go to the patient yeah and then i pull up his echocardiogram which is here okay pull up his echocardiogram yeah and then i do file ah save as and then i wanna do pdf on my desktop right and it's safe okay now oops you know what i should have done hold on file save as uh what happened well okay let me just see what i can do with this okay now let me go to curemd slow mm yeah robin that's the story of our lives it happens a lot okay so i wanna go to um messenges and then compose patient compose message to patient mhm and then browse this is where i got stuck um desktop oh so it's every time you attach a file with the email yeah okay let's let's see if this could be yeah let me see okay we have the attached pdf and uh i'm not sure that's the right one that's 4 21 um let me browse it and open it not a problem this is 4 21 well no that's when i that's when it was done so let me just look and make sure absolutely i think that's i think that's the right one uh let me do it one more time because i absolutely need to put a name on it absolutely absolutely robin take your time i'm i'm right here until you're 100% satisfied okay some go to a message well actually what i need to do is get out of curemd no no no this is what i need to do okay go to documents and then i'm going to go to echocardiogram and then i'm gonna hit that and then i'm going to file save as this is what i didn't do last time and in his name so i never make a mistake you see what i'm saying i can definitely see that and then say awesome okay now i'm gonna get out of this go to messengers and then um there it is right there yes definitely i can see that yeah okay okay and then um i don't want to open it though do i i just want to cancel it because it'll it'll go right in there yeah there it goes okay don't open it so uh so what was did that actually kind of fix what the concern was robin by any chance wow you're kind of like you're like a mastermind by yourself without my help that's amazing what do you think that exactly she might have been was it something you were uh for some reason it wouldn't download to my desktop i tried a couple times and i don't know if i don't know what i think i can uh okay so uh what i actually saw before would you mind opening uh the page you downloaded that file from robin for me if you wouldn't mind i think it was in safari yeah yeah because when you downloaded that i actually saw there was a little option that popped up at the bottom it says it said something that in the future downloading files please go to settings so everything's get saved i think before there was kind of like a setting enabled so every time you were downloading something it was asking you permission and sometimes it happens normally we're working and we don't actually see that tiny little pop up that comes up so we're just looking for the file that we thought we downloaded it but uh i think we're good to go i think um it's working out this time around i'm just kinda bummed out i wish i was able to help you more with this but uh i'm pretty happy that this got resolved so uh but regardless of this concern robin is there anything else i can assist you with anything at all do it thank you thank you yes and that helps thank you awesome not a problem robin well uh i hope you have a wonderful day thank you so much for calling insecurity support oh

alright so that's done then we go all the way down in the medical history you mentioned that hypo clistervenia actually i don't remember but if you remember i'll have to write it down let me make a note of it okay so that is done for here so in the medical history doctor you uh added hypo palpitations had 24 hour holter doctor manawer at date april 27 2021 just this one doctor yes and let's go down doctor in the current medication did you make any changes after or there was no no i didn't make any change review of systems what exactly you added in the review of systems doctor admits

good im good how are you im okay you wanna know my problem first lets lets go by your problem i dont think i was reaching out to you because of a problem but rather i just wanted to check up on the what was the practice name again doctor mohammed what was the name mobayed i didnt i didnt make any headway with him today ive got to look at that i dont know what happened with edward immigration thats absolutely fine i just wanted to check whether i was on the team on the team works or not uh i will double check which i believe not because im not able to see the project anyway getting to your concern let me check okay so my concern so doctor gondola hope and healing has been working with neil just recently to add documents so i guess they they uploaded 22 documents the other day and they were supposed to upload another 100 today i guess neil leaves at 12 oclock and fisher doesnt doesnt know whats going on and she wants to get those 100 files uploaded today so they gave me an s f t p address and the password but when i talked to the practice she said that theyve never done anything neil just goes in and on any desk in does it for them yeah neil must have credentials so the files that are being uploaded are those files uh on doctor gondolas desktop yes if your documents if if if these are documents then uh im sure neil must have a have the credentials he must be using doctor gondolas credentials or neil must be using his own so he im not sure whether he what portal hes using maybe its filezilla  im not sure did doctor gondola mention which portal it was shes saying files zilier zilla so wasif told me told me to reach out to edward and get s f t p credentials so dc system sent me the address and then the password and credentials to get in there but having that she has to then upload those files to that site ive never done this before ive never done this but it makes sense yes if once we have the credentials all we have to do is dump those files within but whats the next step why why are we doing this i recall that uh it has to do with the migration um yeah i think than edward edward is migrating those files to the specific specific folders as part of the data migration understood and edward edward is not able to help edward edward got me an s f t p file so i can certainly have her log into it and see if we can just upload it i dont know yeah she she she she might require assistance uploading it ive never done it myself what i can do is i can go to edward and talk to him maybe maybe you can assist no hes not edwards not in the office either hes working from home i was talking to him on whatsapp mm all right he he was gonna check with neil and see if we can get a hold of neil um i have no idea let me i can certainly call and call the practice and see if we can try to upload this okay and i will certainly try yeah okay thats it i was just wondering if you had ever done this and have any clue ive never done it i know i know what its meant for but ive never done it myself i think brett brett does it i can check with brett its absolutely i can ask brett i can ask brett myself thats no problem let me ask him okay got it you let me know okay and ill ill check on um please okay thank you okay bye"}}, {"id": 683, "data": {"call_id": "1621952752.1047175.txt", "text": "your call has been forwarded to an automated voice messaging system

"text": "singer family chiropractic this is connie hi connie this is colin from cure md and i'm calling in regards to for support ticket where you're not able to search the patients and it's not yielding the correct or updated results um are you the one who created a support ticket yes i am yes all right uh i have seen that you're using internet explorer to use cure md i would recommend you using google chrome because that faster and a more reliable browser and secondly microsoft has stopped the support for internet explorer so any updates which cure md is making to its application is not supported by internet explorer can you please open cure md on google chrome and try over there or if you want we can do a remote session and we can do that together yeah i can try that um i don't know that i can do it right at this moment but i can try it if you think that that's like one of the main issues and you're also saying that if we're continuing to use it in internet explorer like any system updates won't apply to how we're viewing it alright because of the reason that i was able to search the patients normally on my end i just want to make sure that this is the only reason why you're not able to search it i mean about 98% i'm sure this is the reason for the rest of the two person you can confirm me okay yeah because it seems like um whenever you know i close out and try to get back in multiple times it will just kind of randomly find her then and it was just seemed to be that one patient in particular until today then i noticed it was doing it like with other searches so it looks like um there's just a shortcut here on the desktop to cure md so when i click on it yeah i know it will open up internet explorer yeah okay so we do a remote session can we do a remote session so that i can fix it for you so that it always opened up in cure md it will take sharper sure any desk please what's up uh can you go to any desk dot com and download the software so that i can connect with your computer if you go to any desk this is going to be one word you should get an option of download now once you download it and install it will give you a nine digit code a numeric code that you will provide me to connect with your computer yeah alright um where does it show you the code when you open any desk window it should be on the left hand side that this desk your desk can be accessed for this address and there should be a 9-digit code oh okay yep i see it um 659 659 401539 alright i'm sending you a request please accept that okay thank you so very much welcome can i take controls yep alright so we'll minimize this we'll minimize this just two alright that's about it now can you please close it and start from the scratch and make sure that it's working fine for you and i can also use this uh yeah yeah yeah fix that uh can you please hold on for a moment sure i think this is not google chrome yes this is not cloud for give me one moment yeah now it's google chrome okay we can close this and now can you please go to the patient and search for any patient that was giving you trouble before see it i did see her there for a second but then when i went to go and click on it she's gone and it doesn't seem to like that trying to search on her again so the patient that you were searching was j o y c e well that was just another example of one that didn't seem to wanna work earlier but the one that kind of consistently gives issues is kinda last name altrash i'm trying to clear the temporary internet files that might be you know causing this issue so bear with me a few minutes sure can you please log in one more time can you please alright get me to search for her again the the thing is that it you know pulling out this automatically which it should not yeah i've never noticed it doing that before where it shows like other people's names there here you go all right now let me just turn that off i have already turned it off uh alright let's search now for the patient that was causing you the trouble yeah i mean i pulled it right up this time you can go and search for other patients as well because of the reason the thing that was causing trouble was the auto fill forms which i have disabled and now you should not be having any problems yeah see i mean i just just tried searching by this last name and i don't know that it brought anybody up and that gentleman was like literally just here in the office uh is this the first name no it's his last name s wa u g okay i see him there alright so if we use the first name yeah no it still doesn't seem to be working the way it should be no like i literally just typed in todd and hit enter and it says no record found no that would be his first name i thought you told me to search for a first name i'm sorry no problem now there he is that under just the regular search it isn't finding see that's kind of what it had been doing mm mm uh can i please put you on a brief hold to confirm this i'm sorry what was that uh can i put you on a brief hold to confirm this please sure i'll be right back thank you so very much for holding on the line uh can i please take back the controls because i need to work on that now sure all right thank you so very much can you please log in there but i know like do you need me to log in again no you don't need to log in again uh i have bookmarked actually what i have figured out was that the link that were being used for cure md was not correct so i have sorry i didn't hear that no problem the link the website address that we were using before was not correct so i have you know bookmarked the correct uh address over here so that has resolved the issue let's try one last time just to make sure that the issue is resolved can you open google chrome open the google chrome from here yes do you have cure md over here and try from here i mean i i saw her flash but i feel like she flashed even as i was like hitting enter and then she's just not there i mean is it something that i'm doing wrong like i mean i feel like that's how i search for everybody else i'm not sure probably it's because of the anti virus that you're using i'm sorry what was that i think it's because of the anti virus that you're using that that's causing the trouble because once i fixed that it gets fixed it populates all the information and when we do it again it does not populate the information so this is a little shade on my end as well and you know like i'm not sure if it makes a difference for you to know or not but um one of the doctors here her log in works just fine like she has not had this issue so i don't know if it's something specific tied to like my log in um and i don't think she's using google chrome on her computer when she's been accessing cure md alright and could you please confirm me if apart from you is there anyone else in the practice that has having this issue no it's just you yeah because you know like certain can you please authenticate this window that's just popped up mhm thank you was the um the clearing of the cache is that now going to have removed every single like saved log in for every site this one no no no not even this one because the information the one that you're referring to is auto fill form data i did not you know clear that because of the reason i totally understand that it has you know some passwords and other thing so the caches and cookies are just the temporary internet files that are stored on your computer uh so clearing up them does not make any data loss curious if that was no problem no i totally understand that but i did not clear any personal information from the browser alright and one more one last thing was of uh your computer was not restarted from last 14 days this could be one of the reasons uh for the computer not to you know work properly so i mean i i log out of it every day when i leave you're logging out just logs you out from the windows it does not restart the computer so it's it's always recommended that if you you know restart your computer every two or three days so that you know just like the cellphones right when we update our any info any application on the cell phone and once we restart the phone it gets refreshed so that that's the same case with the computers just let me know once your computer is up and running because normally it connects automatically but just in case and by any chance this is just for the general information did this start happening just a few days ago because you know it's been going on with kinda for a while um today was the first that like i mentioned it to um the doctor here and um you know i just had right after that tried searching for another patient um with the first name of joyce and it was saying that no files were found and we know that there's like multiple you know patients with that kinda for a while but like noticing it with other names was just today one thing that i can surely tell you is that if the issue is there it would be with you know majority of the patients are about every patient right so it's not a patient specific error probably it's you know it's the settings or whatever is causing that trouble but just not caused this trouble for a specific patient it would be for multiple patients just the way we see we saw the top was not appearing the joyce was not appearing so you know when when when is um did you get a request for the connection because on my end it is sending a connection request it's just being really really slow right now it's still trying to log me back in no problem one of the other reasons what i can think of is it might be due to the recent update of google chrome because we noticed some uh you know changes in the latest version of google chrome so uh i'll make sure that once we are connected again okay yeah it's still no problem doing it alright yes normally never ever ever this slow i'm not sure what's going on this is the reason why i requested you to you know restart the computer every two or three days or once it's not while the recommended workflow for the system is every single day once you're not using the system and it's not you know uh doing anything in the background it's recommended that you turn it off and then turn it back on again tomorrow or the next business that you're coming because that way it keeps on refreshing the files and it it it does not get this slow now let me just check the billed version for this uh browser and make sure that it's the ones that is required may i please request you to log in sure just give me one moment no problem take your time you see that now it is searching for are you hitting enter or is that just showing up when you type in you know once i'm typing it in it is automatically populating that information i'm not hitting enter uh i just known to make sure that now alright it's working for this uh let's see one more time it's working uh roof it is working lisa working frank working um i'm just seeing the patients which you recently searched there are h i n k working alright the one that you mentioned in the support ticket was k i n d a apparently the issue is resolved apparent working now yeah uh can you just try what one or two more patients that you can think of just to make sure yeah it seems to be working all right and i really apologize but can we just try one last time i'm gonna close this window and we will try from the scratch just to make sure that the issue is completely resolved so we've close it hit refresh here go to google chrome go to cure m d can you put a shortcut on the desktop to this in google chrome for me the one that's there i don't think is right no the cure md shortcut right there that's not the correct shortcut anymore uh i don't think that you need to use that if you just do a little google chrome cure md is right here okay alright i'll just delete it well i mean it won't hurt anything to delete it then because i mean i don't want to use that one if it's not right like there's no reason for it to be there then i guess uh well i'm i'm i cannot really uh comment on that because of the reason previously it was not working well i know but i mean you deleted the one that was originally there and replaced it with the one that's there now you did that earlier on the call thats correct so but i think you changed other things or other settings since you created that shortcut and i'm just so used to out of habit going to the shortcut on the desktop but if it's not going to work or cause any issues like i'd just rather it not be there let's just take it from here okay try it from here yeah i mean it definitely seems to be working all right can we uh just search for todd one more time sure alright now it's just working fine so you can use the shortcut it's working you you also have the cure md uh shortcut on google chrome so just in case if you're in the browser and you need to go to cure md you have that shortcut there and if you want to use it from the scratch you have the shortcut on the home screen and both are working now all right thank you so very much no problem it was my pleasure assisting you today and just for a friendly reminder just make sure to reset your computer either every single day if it's possible for you or otherwise every two or three days just to make sure that it's working as per it is required okay alright thank you so much no problem my pleasure i'm closing this any desk session from my side and do you allow me to go ahead and close the support ticket yes it appears to be working all right thank you so very much for your time and have a wonderful day bye you too bye bye"}}, {"id": 685, "data": {"call_id": "1621886953.10341.txt",

drive actually appears so let's just go on the chrome and see if we can log in okay go ahead okay so let's see if i'm able to see the first thing uh yeah we'll have to download this again or if it's already downloaded we can probably just run it it should be in unless it's deleted mm not that at all no oh yup here it is so do we have to install that every time we sign in uh no that's only one

thank you for asking so i would like to speak with tony she is not in today she'll be in tomorrow oh okay all right what was it for like something specific or did she yeah it was in regards to let me let me open up that email actually so it's um she had a question regarding wild all sides doctor rich and paul um posted that question and this we checked out the workflow the workflow has uh i mean the findings were on that workflow that if the vital signs are documented before the provider initiates the note then they get carried over to the note if they're not initiated before the note creation and after it then they won't get ported over to the note so she uh mentioned something like you know uh checking in our nurse have confirmed she does not always use vital machines plugged in into the laptop she usually enter them manually and sometimes the machine to cross over into the patient chart electronically i'm working if you can ask this could be a part of what is causing the problem okay yeah i'm not 100% sure of that situation because um i know tony was handling that like uh but she won't be in until tomorrow morning so do you think you can call back by i wanna say 9 30 or 10 o'clock tomorrow absolutely definitely call back by 9 30 and 10 tomorrow alright so yeah that would probably be the best thing because yeah tony will be here and she can explain everything to you bingo and besides that we also came to know that she was referring now last meeting that the health exchange information is usually uni directional it's going from curemds end but not you guys are not receiving that on curemd uh the responses so you have to log into another portal to get that information so we checked out with the vendor who we are we did the interface with its uh curemds framework is all up and running it's just they have less staff to cater uh the workload so they have worked on the one directional path of it the second directional path since they have many clients and you know less staff involved on their end so it's it's something that they are holding up on their end so we are now thinking to you know either propose a bigger party who can handle the workload so it's it's actually the vendor on the other end not curemd where uh you could say the unidirectional block up is okay so then i will let you know and then yeah you guys can speak tomorrow morning absolutely all right thank you so much you're welcome christy have a wonderful day alright you as well goodbye alright bye bye"}}, {"id": 697, "data": {"call_id": "1621873758.1026795.txt", "text":

your access code followed by the pound to enable audio controls please enter your audio pin mhm good morning how are you i'm good how are you upgrade is jessica j as well i believe quite yet okay no problem good morning how are you it's actually just a doctor no problem how are you jessica good so how many people would you say i'm asking how many people it's just us so should i just go ahead and start the training yes a few things so you can you guys perfect first of all i will walk you through the patient portal set up location access rights so you can access set up by clicking on the settings tab expand the practice and click on the patient portal set up this is the direct for the patient portal link and all the emails that are sent through no reply at curemd dot com if you want to change this you can uncheck this box and change the email address here okay and currently the modules that are enabled on the patient portal at the homepage register now and keep in touch from here you can select the length so whenever the patient logs into the patient portal go straight to the log in page and these are the available options on the patient portal when registering you can always change the arrangement of these if you wanna bring contacts down you can just click on it here it will bring it down okay okay okay so i have a question here also i'm hearing myself somebody's should i turn mine off your voice is echoing do you hear that yes i was trying to look at the patient portal and we're wondering where the so i know they can sign consents on there can we we can put our practice forms on there too right that is correct mhm i guess one part that we had a question on an air and you can try them in at some point if you if you need a microphone on this one but um there is we're wondering like where does it show up in our patients um folder like we can't find they do like the family history for example where is that gonna be in their chart i will walk you through everything once i am done from the settings page and regarding the forms if you want to upload any forms you can do that by so currently practice forms are not enabled so once we enable practice forms you will see an option here that says practice forms and if you have a document let's say it's in a pdf format or a document microsoft word format you can just click choose file and upload it okay so now i'm gonna move on to the next tab which is the location so these are the locations that are available on the patient portal patients can see this location and the opening times and closing alright where staff is disabled so i'm gonna skip that access rights this is what page can access on their patient portal so under clinical they can access their allergies histories diagnosis they can request medication refills on the patient portal they can see their vitals education document that are shared with the patient for the provider notes nothing is selected lab results they can receive ones and the acknowledgement for the letters they can see all the signs finders and they can request a new appointment and they can cancel plus taken reschedule the appointment okay okay alright okay the notifications are just standard legal let me check so terms of service so the consent form your question was when patients signed these consents from where do they go correct are you there yes yes when patients sign these consent forms where do they go correct where do they go let's start a registration on the patient portal so i can show you where exactly do they go so i have your patient portal open on the other tab so i'm just gonna go ahead and click on register now okay okay these are just terms of service patients have to accept that so i'm just gonna go ahead and make a test account okay okay and just you know there are three locations available on the paper do you want to keep them as it is or do you want to change them just to young minds side yet no just keep them as is okay so if patients have any medical history or family history this was related to your other question where does this information go so i'm gonna go ahead and fill out certain things here let's say hypertension father age at concept 35 years i'm gonna move on to the insurance i'm just gonna select the random one so these are the consent forms that you can see so i'm gonna go ahead and sign these perfect and just to let you know patients have an option to skip so if there are certain forms that you cant find in patient chart they must have skipped it okay i have sent the request to practice now i'm gonna show you how to access this registration request so first of all let me just go inside practice settings to show your permission should be enabled for a user so i'm just gonna go inside my account so if you go under permissions and scroll down to patient portal which is this one if a user has registered patients permission they can accept and reject the request if they have this permission updates the request from the patient portal and they have the specific permission patients can send that either a message through the patient portal okay so once you have these permissions on your home page you'll see a tab that says patient portal request when you click on it registration i have just created a new account find everything by clicking on this tab here and once you're just click accept so the patient has been registered successfully now i'm gonna go inside this patient chart there we go the consent homes are under here mhm all the consents that i find through the papers are under the consents tab and if you click on it the document is just here click on the document and it shows you my electronic signature at the bottom of the page as well got you okay and for the medical history that i was filling out on the patient portal can be found under like on history and if you see here i added my family history surgical history was unremarkable i added some social history and that's it and it shows you that information was added via patient portal okay any questions no for the for this family social medical history doesn't show up on the provider note when you open up a new note yes let's go ahead and try so i'm gonna go ahead and create a note but we have to make sure that the provider has flags for that which no template do you guys normally use the follow up yeah or just a regular follow up patient sure so let's create the note okay there's no history flag on this note okay i don't think they wanted in the actual note is there any way to do it like on the side easy on the side there yes so let's say if you wanna add a family history click on the family history so that information here and if you want to add the social history just click on social history and hit accept and that will auto populate but and that will auto populate the note is there a way for it to show up on the the right side where it says overview history alert right here yeah or no under history it shows everything oh okay so you can click that too if they just wanna look at it that is correct okay just because there's nothing inside this patient chart we just created it that's why the overview is empty at the combination portal which was aspiring and poland so it is showing up here and all the consent from patient portal are here as well alright cool and just to let you know if the note template is a flag for all this information that we added via portal auto population provider we don't even have to expand the history from so say where um we have a patient that needs to find the like the new patient registration through the portal and they didn't receive it um they just go we have the link on our website because they just go to the link on our website and register that way um if the patient is already a new patient they can do let's say the patient is currently registered inside cure md and they do the register now that would create a duplicate account for the patient okay but the best way is let's say it's test daniel okay and i want this user to register for patient portal so once you have that permission that i showed you get the option inside your patient patient chart so just call the patient account like on create portal the patient has an email address you can just send the total log into the patient and they will get the link with their user name and the password and then they got registered any information that they add or update through the patient portal the practice will have to approve the changes first then it gets most into the patient it's just gonna show up on the registration request and you have to accept it the new registration will show up under registration if i go on the patient portal let's try it so i'm gonna go and log in on the patient portal let me just grab my user account just give me 1 second so now i'm inside the patient chart and lets say i changed my first name to harry upper case t and i changed my address well from 114 to 118 and i've changed my phone number there we go and i hit update so it says your request has been submitted successfully now when i go inside curemd under patient portal i see one next to update demographics so i have updated certain information from the patient portal you can see those changes by expanding by clicking here and it shows you in highlighted color the changes that i've made so before this is the new one this was my previous address and this is the new one and if you accept it and hit accept okay and what we probably wanna you wanna put that at the top of our screens too that way okay cool and if a patient request any appointment from the patient portal let me show you how it would look like so requesting new appointment oh harry we're actually speaking this off pardon we're gonna we don't want our patients to be able to access the appointments on here because it's we've we've done it before and it's too difficult with too many providers so we're gonna be taking that off anyway sure so you can take that off like government signed the question set up on the access right and remove anything under appointment okay perfect let me just check one more thing so just to let you know that any appointments that are requested from the patient portal will come under here under the appointment request tab okay and if you have any custom forms available on the patient portal mhm signs it they will come under forms first and once you approve those formss can i call you back i'm in a meeting real quick you can access those forms going inside the card expand the clinical and you will find those forms under custom forms okay any questions on that um no yep i think i'm good just to give you a quickly any consent forms that are signed from the patient portal can be found under consent okay and in case the patient says they want a new passport unable to to the patient portal you can resend the patient portal login by proving over the patient portal click on recent portal login just hit continue and in case if they change their email address you can update their email address from the back end on the settings expand the practice like on patient portal user search for the patient by the last name or first name so this is my user account and if i have updated my email address you can just remove this email address here and update the new one and another way of protecting patient portal account with the patient is by clicking here for the patient by type name and just attach the patient and hit save okay any questions on that so i think we are done with the patient portal training so just to give you a quick recap on the patient portal access permission you'll have to go inside the practice either search for the user and give them the relevant permissions for the patient portal and there are certain times practice enables all the permissions for the provider as well if you enable this permission for the provider patients will start messaging the provider okay okay so make sure the providers don't have access to message in the email message email okay perfect thanks for letting us know that perfect anything else you need assistance with jessica um no i think we're good thanks very perfect thank you you're welcome so if you have any questions you have my email address you can just send me an email okay alright we'll do that okay enjoy the rest of your day to you too thank you bye bye bye"}}, {"id": 700, "data": {"call_id": "1622641187.1240366.txt", "text": "this is

ahead please yeah you go ahead because ram is listening already and i will join as soon as i can i'm trying to download go to meeting alright uh can everyone see my screen ah yeah maybe ram not not as um but that should be okay i think he'll uh doctor doctor ramapali at least can you see the screen there yes yes sean  i can see your screen now the cure md practice financial performance report wonderful wonderful alright alright doctor so um i'll start with a few components regarding your practice where we try to gauge the performance of your practice on on the metrics of the market uh and how well your practice has been doing and what value can add to your to your practice is a billing operations so i'll start off with with the first component which is called clean claim rate now let me give you uh an idea of what clean claim rate is basically whenever claims are submitted into into their first transaction if they go through and and they're successfully processed and they bypass the duplication successfully uh and return back with the payment that ratio or the percentage of successful claims is known as clean claim rate um based on our analysis your practice is currently at a at a very good rate of 86% um and if curemd if curemd has to submit claims on your behalf and billing service will take over we have the capacity and the potential to improve that 86% to uh to a 95% clean clean claim rate um clean claim rate has a direct impact on your cash flow so let's just say if you've submitted 100 claims in one go at a time um at currently at six out of those 100 claims will be approved currently has some certain checks and scrubbing in place through which we are capable of improving the claim claim rate up to 95% uh our our claim validation scrubbing tool is is quite unique since it's powered by more than 7000 industry specific checks and edits that ensures successful and clean clean submission of claims and moreover uh the service also prevents the problematic claims to be submitted unless they're reviewed and the errors are encountered and fixed so this is one of the vital components which has a direct impact on the practices cash flow because the the bigger the number of ccr is the bigger uh the the better the cash flow of the practice would be and it's directly proportional with the revenue as you can read on your screen that 1% ccr improves 1% revenue so if i look at from that perspective perspective we can already see a 9% improvement in the e r just just by um you know curemds claim transmission and the validation and the checks that we have in place um now mm i'm sorry go ahead i'm just saying okay okay alright so up set up next we were able to find out some of the gaps into practices of uh billing operations um to to name a few will start off with charge lacg days uh now charge lag days is basically the difference of of time when a charge is actually created and and when it's actually submitted so what we were able to see that according to current situation your practice has a has a lag of eight business days after a charges created so let's just say 100 charges were were created in in a day it takes almost eight days on average for the for the practice staff to actually submit those claims to the insurances whereas if curemd has to take over the ownership of submitting the claims it does not gets delayed any further as whenever the charges created it's actually submitted this very same day you can see the comparison on the screen this graph basically represents the red line is basically your practices current performance the the the black line is basically for the for the for what market basically suggest so we have indulged the market analysis here to market basically tells us to submit a claim within five days once the charges created whereas when you look at the blue blue bar here in this chart uh you can see that is capable of submitting that claim the very same day without any unnecessary delays so this eventually will reduce the overall turnaround time of the claim cycle and this will eventually increase the cash flow of the of the practice at the at the same time because larger number of claims will be submitted on this very same day and the payments would be coming in smoothly and quickly than they were being submitted uh being received previously because of the charge lag days uh shawn one second can i interrupt you for 1 second please go ahead so um so the claims can be submitted only if uh the document um is signed right by the doctor correct correct okay so so that is why uh doctor ramapali if you see this it says when charges were um uh posted versus or or submission worse this date of service so um essentially this is after you signing the super bill uh for us to pick up alright great um so uh up next is the the lag days being encountered in posting the payment so let's just say uh the claims were submitted from the practice and the payments were received in the system it takes a complete week for the practice staff to actually post the payments received against those submitted claims whereas if you see the comparison the market tells us that you should be posting that payment within five days of receiving in the system and when it comes to these billing service we will not let the payments get delayed even a single day and we'll post the payment this very same day when it's received in the system and how this will basically have an impact on the practice financial cycle this will actually reduce the turnaround time of the claim submission to the secondary insurance because let's just say you submitted claims to to the primary insurance in the first place you received the payment so you cannot proceed further forward and you know uh forward the claims to the next responsible insurance unless the payment for the primary has been posted in the system so it has a direct linkage with the posted of the secondary insurance so let's just say if we're taking a lot of time and posting the payment from the primary insurance the the the the outstanding balance for the forwarding balance to the secondary insurance will actually be aging and and it won't get processed unless the payment of the primaries posted in the claim is forwarded to the next responsible insurance so yeah it has a direct impact on your cash flow and the best part of having the accurate payment posting in charge submission and timely manner is that it will basically project accurate financial reporting and analysis at the same time as well so that um to give you an example for this let's just say there were some payments receiving uh at the end of june but they were posted at the start of july so when you run the bank deposit report for the revenue report for june those payments would actually not reflect there if you'll be running it by the transactions posted in that month however they belong to the charges that were that were actually posted in june so it's very imperative that the payments are actually posted in a timely fashion so that it projects an accurate financial reporting at the same time yeah bottom line if if you don't if you don't have this done in a timely fashion um your reports are certainly not reliable so you're pulling up your er report and looking at that in the system but uh you're not sure whether what you're looking at is is correct or not if uh if those payments are not posted um you know regularly that lag time can uh can cause uh a sense of illusion um there thank you mr um alright so uh that was about the payment posting lag days now uh up next uh the very most the very alarming point that we saw in our analysis which was lag in the claim re submission now in in previous analysis of of payment and the charges lags we saw that the difference was not too high however if you look at the lag and claim re submission days there's a huge difference of of the number of days that the practice is taking in order to resubmit the claims that are either rejected or denied so as we can see that whenever a claim is submitted and it lands back do you do any billing error or any any problematic thing it takes good 51 days to the practice to resubmit that claim or reprocess that claim uh and have that uh you know adjudicated properly and get received the payment against that particular claim now whenever there's a huge gap in addressing says claims that this this actually requires you know uh a lot of um um being vigilant on on this part because it it will basically make most of your practices um claims go into it as a part of the a r and the bigger problem at hand is that when you're taking this long time there is a very high chance that your claim might end up being in the timely crossing the timely filing limit and this will eventually have a direct impact and the decrease of the revenue increasing the accounts receivable and it will basically put the revenue at stake due to some timely filing concerns so this was like one of the one of the biggest red flags that we could encounter in the entire uh analysis that we perform which which can be eliminated if curemd takes over as you can see that curemd has the capability of resubmitting the the rejection or the denial within the same day whereas the market basically tells us to do that within 10 days after we receive a reject rejection or denial most alarming situation that we wanted to uh enlighten you about um so this was pretty much it about the the the gaps that we found out the next thing that we're gonna tell you is about how effectively the denials are being managed in the system so uh currently uh there's a huge chunk of uh of denies that are being covered under different um different remark however uh i can see that the the annual percentage of the denials is not too high but this can be prevented when you're sending tons of claims this percentage will actually contribute to to a higher number of a r and if curemd have to take over to the to the denial management we have basically two different methodologies that we adopt in order to prevent and handle the denials through which we are able to actually prevent 90% of the denials and we will be able to improve the uh the the clean clean same rate for the for the claim submitted so this has a direct impact on the revenue at the same time will be saving a lot of administrative cost because denials can be very very hectic hectic you have to you know dig down the reason of the denial you have to fix the claim and you have to resubmit it all the way uh to the insurance to make sure that it's reprocessed correctly however there are chances that even after a claim is resubmitted there might be some further errors that the that the that the insurance amount might encounter and they might return the claim another reduction or denial so it's very imperative at this point that denials are handled uh and prevented uh effective uh thank you for that john so uh any questions so far doctor i have questions now um when is it how do you all work it actually recall the insurance company actually doctor we we we like i mentioned earlier we're basically working on two models the first model is to prevent a denial from happening the other model is by handling effective denials after they received in the system so let's just say if if curemd has to submit the claims first of all like i like i mentioned earlier in the discussion that we have certain checks in place that actually validated the claim information that is being submitted so even if somebody is is about to make a human while while creating the claims our system is capable of identifying that discrepancy and fixing it before the claim is being submitted we we get intemation from the system that i'm sorry go ahead so not saying that you you have a minimum minimum amount of denial if at all is denial yes that's right so i guess the question is once it is denied uh sean if you can uh um elaborate on what's the process of managing that denial so that it goes out the very same day so i guess it's more about on that situation when when it does come back how do you manage it well once the denial lands into the curemd application our our billing team is capable to actually um work on the denial reason why why that particularly was denied they they are able to fix that claim and moreover once that client that claim is resubmitted after getting fixed um effective follow follow ups are done by the billing team to make sure that that it is being um you know processed correctly we'll basically be managing the denials in a way that um once they're back in the system due to whatever reason um that that first of all that reason is addressed and it's it's submitted in a in a timely fashion to the churches so that it does not fall under under any any further problems and our our team is capable to um follow up on that claim later on to make sure that it's it's submitted and and paid um in a timely fashion as well uh the other model is to prevent sorry you were saying sean please proceed my bad yeah so so uh so the the the primary model is to prevent the denials from happening because uh we understand that uh uh handling the denial is basically going to increase the administrative trade of cost so our model is to basically uh feed the system with certain rules uh we'll we'll perform a certain analysis with your help uh in which we can actually give certain rules to the system to make sure that a certain cpt is submitted with a certain modifier to avoid that claim to being denied so system would be able to tell us if we're we're billing uh uh a q six modified with a certain c p t which is not a requirement so system will be able to tell us that we should not be submitting this claim with this modifier and it will prevent the claim from being submitted incorrectly and ask us to change that instead of actually letting that claim go and you know getting that to be denied and then afterwards our team should be handling it the system would be actually focusing on preventing the denial instead of handling it later on however we do have a handling mechanism at the same time let's just say if 90% claims are prevented rest 10% are denied our team is capable of fixing the manually and then getting getting that added um uh to to the process claims at the same time and in another aspect that i wanted to highlight doctor ramapoli is that it's also about uh you know one aspect is the system where it's it's designed or practices that are designed to prevent those in the first place um but once a um denial is received um it's also the amount of trained human resource that we can throw at a particular practice uh that makes it more efficient for example there is a dedicated group whose job it is to prepare charges and they don't do only that and they get uh more efficient than doing that folks that are doing ar follow ups are only doing that one piece out of this entire uh billing there is a dedicated group that's only doing uh dental management so so that being able to throw throw that kind of manpower um at a single account also makes it more efficient for us to do do it that way nice yeah so um the question i have i have a question sir now when you did this analysis did you do it for the whole year or did you just randomly take a few months and do this all this analysis that you have um so this analysis basically it's basically from may 2020 to may 2021 it was mentioned at the top of the the start of paid off this presentation that this is from may 2020 to may 2021 okay so in your experience and expertise you know i know you only did it for one day now what do you think that how can you measure the increase in revenue if we give all this if we give you the contract on that you know is it gonna be 10% you you know do you have any kind of feel on that it's gonna be 15% you know our our feeling is based on what we're seeing in terms of gaps here for example i believe um sean first mentioned about the clean claim ratio that's one aspect that that's going to impact um the um the revenue uh effectively and but most importantly um uh what we're seeing uh the lag in payment posting and denial management um that's going to have an impact generally um speaking when folks go from um the um an in house billing system to cure md that uh um that value within the first six months uh um ranges for 5 to 10% depending on uh what their situation was at the time they they start off with us um so i mean it's going to rain somewhere in there uh i would like to add something here to um um based on the analysis that we've done we've seen that the the account the appointment count has has started to increase and and from what i see that it has to be doubled or maybe you know the increase uh a lot in the in the following year or or maybe towards the end of the year so when when there there's a there are larger number of appointments um you know there's some excessive sort of um um well validation or follow ups are timely submissions that are required to be done because um considering the the front amount of numbers that we have uh maybe when the when the numbers increase we'll have a more excessive validation and follow ups and submissions to be done to make sure that it's not being mishandled i mean if we are able to effectively handle it like i mentioned earlier in my uh presentation that um clean claim ratio is directly proportional with the with the revenue so let's just say for now if we're able to improve 9% according to the current numbers it's it's a direct 9% increase into the revenue however this is just a projection we believe that if we work on all of these indicators like uh by improving the claim turnaround time by decreasing the revenue leakage by eliminating the gaps in your in your practices workflows uh we're we're we're highly optimistic on the fact that this is gonna save us a lot of time this will this will have a lot of high administrative efficiency because we'll be we'll be taking care of the denials rejections or the claim submissions within the same day whereas currently when when it's being dealt manually by people there are lags their legs for like good seven or eight days so imagine these number of good days are gonna be reduced from the overall turnaround time of the payments so automatically uh we'll be we'll be increasing the number in terms of revenue and we'll we'll bring a lot of financial success you're not really billing but i don't know you might be able to help with we are struggling to get somebody do our contract negotiations with the commercial insurance honest obviously we don't have much uh commercial insurances in new mexico but is there any way uh the curemd has any uh any expertise that can help with the um with the contracting contract negotiation with the insurance absolutely uh we can help you with that as well we have a dedicated credentialing team that can help you with contracting and negotiation with commercial fairs commercial and government affairs boat so you just need to share the data with us you just need to share the existing progress of your uh your processing with pears and uh we'll take over from there but that but credentialing it as an add on service just to let you know about it sure that we have credentialing with all the insurances but we need contract negotiation because we are taking whatever they gave us um we want to we want to proceed with the negotiation so uh if we if you can if you have those services and depending upon how much it's going to cost us we would like to use the services too yeah so what we can do what we can do like clive mentioned we can we can analyze that data and uh come up with the uh with the projection for you on uh what can you expect uh essentially uh and and also what the cost will be on that so we can give you data to so you can see it and make an informed decision i know that you know other practices cannot disclose their reimbursements what you're getting so is there any way when you look at stuff because i'm sure you know you can compare to see what we're getting i'm not asking any numbers but can you tell us well you know the blue cross blue shield you guys compared to the rest of the practices you know you're getting a reimbursement or a law and reimbursement or average reimbursement could could you could you give us that information uh later on we can actually uh give you a a deidentified information based of the demographics of multiple practices maybe we have the practices available that are working in your area in the same state in the same city and uh on the same specialty basis we can provide you that information but with the identification with not without the name of the practice there are so many oncology practices i don't want to disclose the name but i know there's one in all they are taking their really good so i don't know if we can get um i don't know i don't they are they are with curemd but um um what whatever you can the the deidentification information or something like that i'm really happy it it it highly depends on the basis of the services that you're rendering it depends on the base of the locality of the practice it depends on the speciality education of the doctor at the same time as well so we just uh run a discovery call with you and try to understand that what are the you know how the paperwork was filed when you started the credentialing process and what rates have they offered you so far and then we'll check with our existing practices that what kind of roots they are getting and then we can run a comparison and share the details with you accordingly that would be sorry go ahead no no that's that's what i'm just saying that's really good and we want that information soon i'm just going to say that and i just have a question um so uh the presentation was very good in terms of the analysis uh how what mistakes uh were happening on our happening on our side um so based upon um uh uh what you presented basically there have been some delays in our uh uh uh or some uh several things uh from what i can understand please correct me if i'm wrong uh uh we'll be receiving money faster uh with less uh uh less manual work uh much less manual work from our side but uh what is the net profit uh if we have to use your service is sean will be and how can you how do you say that we will have a net profit uh you know for us uh it's it's good to have money in one time faster uh because you know we have to spend a lot of money on the drugs and uh uh but uh looks like we are getting money in a slow process but the way we are doing uh why would uh curemd uh does it just uh get help us to get money faster or help us generate more money or get more money for the services we are providing okay by me go ahead clive go ahead sorry i wanted to say that uh right now we have you know presented a comparison that how you you're doing right now what is the marketing benchmark market benchmark and how curemd can can add value to that but that addition of the value is not going to take effect overnight we will definitely start marching towards that benchmark and try to achieve that much soon as soon as possible so the thing is the kind of factors we have identified here those factors are going to improve your cash flow and the the the overall you know the lag times will be reduced as well for example right now uh the submission time is 51 days so if we are not visiting like 45 business days of 40 or 49 business days to submit one claim the claim will definitely get processed in a much uh faster manner and you'll get paid in the faster manner manner as well so there's there's a dual impact you'll get paid faster and you'll get paid more if we eliminate the denials and rejection at the same time as well so so a couple of things that i wanted to add here one was um one was this at the same aspect there that clive highlighted so if they're less claims that go into that 90 day bucket um that that's uh that's a major um aspect that that's going to assist with this entire process uh less timely filing less money that's written off of the account that you never um see again that could have been collected in the first place um last but not the least um you know the the rates as such are um and you'll find yourself that there are effectively lower than uh what you would pay for the same amount of manpower um then you can hire yourself in the practice it's it's essentially uh economy of scales at the end of the day based on um because based off of that as well so um you know we uh we definitely feel that combination of both you'll you'll see uh more money um um being being there as income not just an increase of revenue but then how do you sorry go ahead what how do you build us what would be the charges for this for your services so i guess what we can do is um uh clive uh sean if you have um the collection details as well if you can pull that up um we can uh generate a quote and uh and and share that with the with the practice do you have collection details by any chance uh there with you uh john or your clive uh yes yes mr wasif i do have the numbers with me and i can just send it to you after we're done with this meeting and we can actually um get back to to doctor with with with a perfect quote right so so what happens is based on that code and and we understand the revenue might be higher based off of the drugs you don't have the same kind of margins on drugs as the rest of the services so we'll split them up drugs are going to be uh uh drug related collections are gonna be building them at a fraction of a percent point um to uh over there so that you don't overpay for that and actually the whatever a residual amount for the rest of the services the billing percentage is going to be decided on that so i will collect that information from the team here uh generate that quote and uh share that with you sir the one thing we are concerned about um if there's a medicaid reimbursement usually the drug cost us $10,000 i'll say 11,000 and a lot of times the may you know medicaid will only give us 10,000 so we have to depend on the secondary insurance however on the $10,000 they the the the state taxes the grocery seats taxes included in the 10,000 which is 8.31% so actually if if they're going to get reimbursed 10,000 we're already losing $1000 on the drug uh but we can collect on secondary insurance could be that could be like about maybe $14 $1500 right but the main thing is our concern is by the time we pay the taxes the grocery seats on that you know we're not making any money off that could be a lot of money so so that's my main concern because medicaid is a big part of our practice so what i'm saying is you know when when you look at the codes and you're going to send us uh you know a proposal you know keep that in mind please and and give us a good rate so we could uh you know we could have this uh a contract with y'all because you know we we need to make money on this or else it's not gonna be good for us because we are a small practice but i think we're doing very good and in the future we're looking at as a matter of fact right now we're looking at bringing on another doctor to our practice so you know and and i know if if if he previous the volume you can give us probably you might give us a better rate on that right absolutely and and not only will i give you a quoye right now i will also be able to project how that will scale as your projections uh um go higher because obviously that's going to be our goal as well um we have a we have a vested interest in your practices success uh from that uh perspective so i'll show you both not just a quot e with that we're starting off with but also how this will scale as your collections grow which we're almost certain will grow even with the your services will include collecting secondary insurance too right totally secondary insurance is uh also are able to um send out patient statements the only thing that we charge for patients statements and and send those out is uh printing and mailing it you know the cost for uh first class first class uh uh mail whatever that is 40 cents or 50 cents whatever that is in in in in the cost of the paper we we do that and send those statements as well so we help with patient collections at the same time okay great so we move on to the next important thing uh chris and mr wasif this is the one that i need the most the rest is for my husband and using but this is for me go for it authorization prior authorizations for chemotherapy medications sure so so we can assist with that uh uh process as well we'll have to work with your practice initially to ascertain the workload um uh to to identify um how many uh prior authorizations are we going to be uh processing in a given month and and based on that we can identify how many uh f d s are we going to post uh to the practice to do that i will i will share that scale with you uh so that you can you can see it that as well at the end of the day our job will be to communicate with the practice to collect that information effectively and be able to post that to those uh prior authorization portals um whether it's a pair portal or covered by meds or uh or never for that purpose and and pull that information back in and and post that in the system um the system as you can see doctor rama we already have a tool um specific to uh prior authorization and tracking prior authorizations in the system um so what we're posting that there so that it's visible for your practice when you're doing scheduling or you're doing um um you know even if something falls through the cracks and and the patients there uh the system is able to warn the nurses that you're now about to move forward with a uh treatment that uh hasn't been prior authorized in the system um so you know it'll it'll warn them from that perspective the combination of both the service and and what we have uh tracking capabilities of the system we should be able to take care of it uh however i believe sean and frank uh we're able to uh discuss that earlier uh chris was able to pass that on to us um uh this information to us but prior to the demo um and thank you chris for that so i believe and um uh and frank might be able to um enlighten us with more information on that gentlemen please proceed mr wasif i i really don't have that much time i might want it as early as tuesday because i have been a patient just now before lunch and ovarian cancer i have to start her on the treatment asap and the drugs are expensive i don't know how to do the authorization to let you know my manager quit on me yesterday evening just be asked to be nice to the employees so i told chris the story and i don't have time i'm freaking out and i have a lot of resumes which means every month authorization so the the i'm i'm telling my hopes on you to start on tuesday authorization process if not the billing i really i'm not i'm not billing is not my area but i have to take care of my patients as soon as i can uh i have a breast cancer patient who needs treatment she she's done with the authorization and i now have a worrying cancer patient who i need to start the treatment i'm really very anxious and uh i need something immediately as early as i mean if if i mean i understand the situation we'll do anything that we can to do help i mean uh for for a patient who's uh who's waiting for a treatment if even if i have to pull up my sleeves and start doing prior authorization for you myself i'll i wouldn't uh uh fall back from doing that but uh but but i understand your situation doctor rama we'll we'll we'll work on this uh immediately and uh come back to you with uh with the solution um you know we we we wouldn't i understand the urgency of the situation is what i'm trying to say um uh you know we'll we'll um we'll we'll circle back to you on that uh or i mean sean and uh uh clive are experts there um they can speak more on that uh so so folks if you can uh uh shine in on this please uh whatever we can do to assist thank you wasif uh yes we can we can uh take over the authorization responsibility for the practice uh but uh we will have to evaluate the data we will review that how many resources we will have to deploy on that uh like uh that uh we will have the data from right after this call we will evaluate with the billing manager and uh we will get back to you earlier uh uh early morning on monday uh with an answer that uh uh and just to add a bit that it would be an adam service and it will be exclusive from the same contract because uh taking doing the benefit verification and uh taking the authorization for the for the for the chemo it will be exclusive from the same contract and will be an added service but we can review the volume and we can uh come up with the court on monday okay sure so yeah and everything right all the drugs she works on foundation if there is because as you know we most of the patients they cannot especially in new mexico they cannot afford the copay so she used to find the foundations for them the drug companies provide the free drugs so i'm expecting all those services uh if you're going ahead because i don't want any of my patients to suffer or to miss the previous clinic manager because she she's good at getting free drugs from the drug companies patient cannot afford it including the i v medications for patients she got herceptin and for her ear for her for her lifelong when how long ever she receives the treatment so she she did those kind of things um which will which help the patients and they're really happy about it because they cannot afford the copays or something like that so i'm i'm expecting all those services actually understood i think what we could do is um um is get that list or or work with uh anybody in your staff that can point us in the right direction initially and and we can figure that out uh from over there i mean i know that um your your your your office manager was kind of taking care of these even if they're available for for an hour or or something of that sort uh where we're at least we can have a smoother transition uh from this perspective if not then we'll try and figure that out um on our own i just wanted to make sure that uh you know since we're doing this um um you know um you know immediately or something of that sort we we don't miss out on anything so any of your nursing staff or um or any other office that are more familiar with uh what's currently being done for the patients that can um that can um kind of walk us through a few of those example uh we understand the process and then we can certainly take care of it uh i'm afraid i will not be able to give much uh much we can give you the list of the patients who are inactive who are actively on chemo she quit i don't know if she's yeah but i i don't think we will have anyone except for me to help give you some information um you don't have doctor rama patient they're active on chemo of course we can uh generate a report from the system that's not going to be a problem what what i'm actually hoping for is that if you can connect us with the organizations that are you currently working with to um to obtain that support or those uh support organizations that you generally work with um if you can introduce us to to them we we will pick it up from over there that's kind of what i was hoping for okay i don't know what she online search actually she probably did online foundation or uh some kind of foundations like that and see if they actually sorry sorry to interrupt you mr wasif uh so actually my son has a um uh do you remember my son had uh like they offered that they'll do this thing for us uh but they were charging a lot of money and uh but they have a free actually i think mr wasif i think we may have access to their um uh the information like that and maybe we'll forward that to you and um so what you said is uh uh they can just give the information we'll do we'll have to work um or maybe charge a little bit and uh get the information to us or they'll do all the work or most of the amount of work they're going to charge us accordingly so um and uh at the time we did not have we did not you know we were kind of busy and other things and not pay much attention but uh maybe we should uh uh maybe we can look into that and uh pay uh certain money small amount of money and get get the information of those organizations uh that uh do this free drug stuff for discounted drugs you know so i mean sorry i was just gonna add i mean as far as uh you know our folks are concerned they're they're used to um you know having those phone conversations even when we're there there um talking to insurance is for follow ups and and and and passing on that information to uh for claim adjudication or otherwise so the process itself uh reaching out to an organization relaying that information is not all that different um so we we just are looking for it since you you mentioned that urgency i just wanted to make sure that folks that are uh um going to get that treatment soon enough um you know we we're armed with that information uh right from the on set and and not waste time searching or anything of that sort that's that's kind of what i meant okay okay i think rama you should have that uh information that patients need this uh drugs and all that stuff right i know who who needs three drugs but the thing is which organization she's reaching out to not be able to no no they they that's what he was saying that i think they have some knowledge of all the stuff you know yeah yeah or we can even compliment from if they want uh we can also log into or try to get some information from so mr wasif do have a dedicated uh team that just does this uh uh mr wasif audition process uh correct correct uh so it's it's a separate team from our uh main rcm force um that does so so just like what i mentioned earlier um there's a separate team that does credentialing and uh contract negotiation there is a a different team that does um uh claim follow ups and yet another separate team that does only uh prior authorization so i'm sure you can understand that the prior authorization team um is much more hands on with the practice communication than others because um they will have to reach out to doctor rama at times to get that information so that they can get the prior authorization done um that when we're working with insurance is the um the prior authorization requirements for for drugs vary based on which pair you're you're you're talking to um so um we might need to come back if we can't if we can't find that information in the system for us to use on our own we might need to come back to doctor to get that information or someone designated in the office that can get us that information for us to post in the system but our folks are trained to efficiently pull information out of the system post that on the patient portals and and uh and bring that uh prior authorization number one once it's obtained that's that's kind of what they're trained on doing oh nice so uh who should i contact on tuesday because i will keep them waiting until tuesday and tuesday i should i should give the information to the prior team which drugs i want the authorization on and all those things i'll put the care plans in and who should i follow will you get me the information on monday who i should who i should forward that uh so sean and frank on the call and set up uh leaving that out for you they will have that discussion internally and uh um and they'll work with you to set up a a formal meeting so that we don't leave it for uh to chance let's uh let's get back to you uh let's let's do this monday um at a time convenient for you um uh and and it will also give these guys some time to um discuss internally and how it's going to work out um i i um uh i'm suggesting a similar meeting on um on monday where we can discuss both the quote for the our services and then talk about how this process is going to work so maybe um uh sometime monday where where these guys get a chance to um look at the prior authorization situation i would like monday seven a.m. because i have a busy schedule on monday i don't think i'll be able to come out of the office in in any time once i start seeing the patients if we can do it at seven o'clock our time uh that means nine o'clock eastern time uh if you can accommodate that i'm sorry i'm asking for a lot but uh i have so many patients on monday no i understand um we'll we'll try our best to keep the same of time it's just that it's already shared on four p.m. right now and these guys might might need to um have a discussion internally on monday to get back to um we'll like i said we'll we'll try our best to keep that appointment um and we'll confirm that uh to you uh later uh later today or or early morning before the start of the day your your time uh that it's confirmed that we could do it we'll we'll we understand the urgency doctor rama we'll try our best to take care of it thank you thank you very

just partially filled and the rest is a blank page so it's initially should okay initially should have more information on it right correct okay what do you think what do you presume is really missing like the chunk is it like more of okay let me be hmm just one moment uh kimberley i'm just taking over the controls i'm just gonna try figuring this out okay thank you uh kimberley kimberley would you mind just changing the status for this back to schedule because i just wanted to uh recreate this and try to print out a super bill just to see if this is happening for me okay just to make a few

working on it so you don't hear the background noise okay okay no problem thank you mhm ah there we go awesome so that actually my uh one of my superiors josh he helped me with this is it okay if i can get the logical explanation for this because i would love to let you know why this was happening okay yeah just give me one moment thank you sure thank you okay perfect so uh kimberley i just understood so when you were let's say uh printing the super bills right so what was actually happening is we went ahead and we looked at the back end you actually have a few number of different templates that are added so if you wouldn't mind just taking the controls over and printing that i'll just show you what was happening so in the future if you ever see that there you'll know why uh this was occurring so you can always revert that okay so you want me to yeah yeah just if you can follow that work order and just yeah so perfect so now do you see like at the very yeah the very bottom where it says super bill template so this was before set to just super bill so it used to be at new super bill yeah so the super bill template we looked into that just prints out one section or one portion of the super bill even though if you were to print out a lot more it'll just do that 10 or 20% of the super bill itself so the new super bill template that's the one that you will should use and will use in the future to get all that accurate information so it was a simple fixed but um yeah just took the time to decrypte it what actually was happening awesome so uh any anything else kimberley since we're on the call no that would be all thank you so much awesome thank you so much kimberley have a lovely day you too bye bye"}}, {"id": 721, "data": {"call_id":

because you know i didn't know what this meeting was scheduled for nine so i had run into an error and so took me you know 10:15 okay let's let's just jump in dave i think that uh uh there there's no need to to be uh mean or screaming out anything but i think that you hear clear we're pretty frustrated and it took two weeks weeks to get this report um i now see on your email last night that you had sent payments for april uh or i guess through present and then you sent charges to match that uh again i'm not sure why it took two weeks to get get two months of charges reports i know that what you're doing is trying to add it on to the report that you already sent that's not what we need and that's not what we asked for um what i need you to do because uh they're billing team they're constantly inputting old charges into the data if that makes sense like that report that we got through march it was really close to in march close we've done this before and i always see updated charges and payments uh from like from historic months so they might in the month of april they might still be putting stuff in for february a little bit a lot of times it's not significant but i've seen it in instances where it's you know $50,000 kind of thing so again what we need you to do we need you to run that report run the same report just and payments all payments on a separate row uh we need you to run that from january 2018 through present day does that make sense it does make sense i can run that report but thing is that joseph as i mentioned you we cater these requests for the customized reports once in a while like you might need that report by yearly or maybe quarterly okay we cater these kind of reports but you know it's clashes with our business uh business concept or you know our business uh line because we do have we are offering a similar service we do have it you need to report on every day every week we provide you that report under report you want to pull that report on time because i totally hear that now let me joseph let me let me tell you one thing let me tell you yes because you know for example you put in a request today let me tell you the process you know i totally understand i told you right away because for the first time or maybe the second time you asked me for the report and i told you it takes some time okay because you know i wanted to you know make it clear for you that you know it takes some time because you know what we do you know i'm in the support team i don't know how the databases or the s q l queries how those things actually work on the back end or how how the data sources are working on the back end what i do i put in a request with my development team they have the standard sop for processed thing or you know uh catering that request within 2 to 3 days i cannot escalated because you know this is a customized report first thing after 2 to 3 days i'll get the data sp dave i'm going to interrupt you i apologize dave i'm going to interrupt you i understand the first time it was a customized report but as i spoke with you personally months ago i told you this was going to be an ongoing report and i know joseph is communicated that to you i don't understand why then was not saved and all you have to do is run the data every month it's not a new customized report customized report the first time i requested to do yes but let me let me put that in uh in other words every report that need to be fight from the back end we considered let's let's say it's a terminology it's a customized report anything that cannot be pulled from on the front end we call it a customized report let me put this way for you because the development has so many other request bugs glitches hours they need to cater that you know the reports are the one that you know they take it usually 2 to 3 days to process okay we do have the query definitely as i told you i don't know about the queries but at least i know that for example let's say if there is a coding that they have to do 67 lines there to pull some certain data they have that there might be a template that they run in fact the data but on their end they have to do some verification and you know they need to update the database before running that report now let me tell the process afterwards once i get the data imagine i put in a request today and tomorrow i get the data i have still have to verify it i need to put that in the tabular form in which you guys are looking at because you know on the back end data is not exactly in this form how you're getting it in the report joseph told me that he needs the data to be you know uh segregated on the cbd level separately on each line and have all that now we are talking about the data from 2018 until 2021 it's almost three years three years worth of data you have seen the file it's a huge file of excel even my system it's it's a very good computer it takes so much time you know when i'm trying to solve these lines putting in filters putting in formulas to you know uh you know format that sheet it takes yes i agree with that i i totally understand that i apologize that this time it took two weeks because i mentioned in the email there was an error there was a verification error i'm sorry to interrupt but the problem is now it's taken two weeks and it's still not correct it is correct let me tell you joseph that we've continued to request monthly it's it's it makes no sense christina let me let me put this way you're uh i'm sorry to uh negate you but i don't remember talking to you i believe you might have spoken to breth okay so first of all when joseph told me that this is their monthly requirement i didn't i never knew that okay because the last report i provided it was until may and the next request he was requesting it was after may 28 or maybe requesting the data until may 28th okay let's just put all that in past from not applied onward i'll provide you the report on a monthly basis on you know let's just say for example today is june 4th so i'll tell you that you know the report will be ready by june 5th but again there is a point because if i request the development team on the end of uh let's just say may 30th or 31st at that time the data will be extracted anything that needs to be done within those 56 days that would not reflect in the report that is the problem with the customized boarding because once the data is extracted we do verification we do customization we do formatting and then anything that that we do it does not reflect real time so again you know there might there might be discrepancies there might be uh you know the numbers might not match up and i need to get i need to get the confirmation from the management because you know uh uh we do not provide the customized report on the monthly basis but i'll put in your case that you know this is an audit ongoing process so you might need that report a monthly basis i hope i'll get the approval because you know as i mentioned earlier that it's in direct clash with our business uh business cost that you know we offer a similar product so the management is definitely gonna ask that why the customer is not using that product if they need that report for an ongoing purpose and over for let's say a year or two years so and so on a couple of your questions if you can if you can fit me in sure are you ready yes yes yes yes sure great we're only gonna need this report a couple more times right i mean i think overall it's taken some it's taken some iterations to get the report that we needed but in the grand scheme of things we only would have needed this report three or four times right it's been a whole lot of back and to get this report three or four times we may need a couple more times but we don't need this going on into the future six months from now i don't think the business team you if if you can get this report we're going through a specific exercise right now after that we won't need it okay that totally makes sense or whatever that's great but that is not what we're curious about right now okay what we need right now is this report um so what you're saying is support for the three years is just it's just too much effort you guys aren't willing to do it no no no no no i'm not saying that i'm not willing to do it but the thing is it takes time that was that's what i'm saying if you want me to update this report for you what i can do i already have uploaded the data from 2018 until may 2021 i just need to copy this data back into that sheet and i'll upload it because you know if you look at your email you listen stop and listen what i'm saying is how about this i need you to run the back half of 2020 through present again the whole thing i i can take the data and dump it into the into the same sheet that's not hard not what my concern is the reason i'm asking you to run everything historically is because there's a lot of old part is that our input if you can just do like the back half of 2020 through president that's great i'll give it to the accountant and they can bump that data up against each other and make sure but the reason i need you to do prior months and then we can just bump one month up against due one month at a time and added to the data set is because our billing team puts in old information okay so i need that legacy stuff run again to make sure that we're picking up any old information does that make sense yeah it totally makes sense okay so i need here's what we're gonna do coming out of this call we need charges and payments same format same problem let me sorry to interrupt you uh july 1st from one july 2020 23 present that does that make sense july 1st 2020 until today are june one let's make it june one how about that that's fine i can just do whatever whatever um when should we expect to have that report uh huh can we call on monday that would be great if you can have it for monday that would be amazing uh in the first half uh monday i'll try my best to give you this referral amazing i appreciate you so much before we end this call we need the incremental data from first like 2020 until june and you want this report to be incorporated in the you know the master report that is from 2018 or you wanted separately that's fine we can do that on our end you can do that on your end either way doesn't doesn't make a difference okay sounds good then okay we have we are close to clear on that no worries no worries i don't know that's okay that's okay no worries alright anything else christina you want to discuss no thank you dave no worries thank you so much for your time guys have a good day"}}, {"id": 724, "data":

received this ticket of yours where you were not able to link two patient sisters with each other so i found out the reason why exactly what's going on so could we do a remote session on your computer let me assist you with that sure any desk any desk dot com i need to get hang on it's really slow today no problem so go to download download download okay i did download now like it might be it's just super slow today thats alright open okay it's saying remote address alright may i have the number um let's see my address is (425) 389 375 thank you i'm sending you the request just hot accept once you receive it okay incoming connection request accept click to share your entire screen i'm trying to click share but it won't let me know just just that's right uh what are you it says just waiting for image probably it's because of uh delay in the internet connectivity i'm waiting for the image to appear on my end okay click share well i'm i'm i'm sending the request again i don't know for some reason it was not connecting see if you get a pop up now yes i got it just hit accept okay i hit accept and now it says any desk wants to share the contents of your screen and what what options does it give you it gives me cancel and it says share but i can't click it it won't you know it's trying to cancel it okay hit cancel okay now it says it's flashing on remote address uh-huh never mind let me let me brief you the work flow alright so the two sisters just just go to one of the sisters you know one of the patients okay go tp curemd yes go to curemd go to the profile of one of the patients okay i'm trying to get there let's see it was garcia i believe mhm one was leah and the other one was uh hm right okay so i'm i'm in a alena okay so what demographics sure now go to family family let's see yes okay and tried yeah add no i don't no don't add it uh you would have to actually just a minute i'm actually getting there right now as well you're in the profile of lia right i was in the profile of elena elena okay so what you do is you do you see where it says add unregistered family members and then it says add registered family members and then it says delete right yes click on delete okay now it will be gone right whatever okay now go to the uh profile of the uh the the okay uh huh and that's where you will be able to add actually what what the problem was that the family was created for both of the users so you cannot have you know family created for both the users either one patient can have a family created and the other patient can be added there that is the reason it was showing us grayed out now you go ahead and add under leah uh add a register family member yes and then the other one yes and now you have the option to check the box let's see okay i'm searching for her yes and i can check the box and put add in family ahan alright i did that perfect and now she is there i'm going to verify my end as well there she is and now you can change the relation from brother to sister okay and alright um let's see family looking for where it says relation yes brother to sister yes and now even if you go to the profile of alena uh you know she would have under family she would have leah associated to her as well but you know the head of the family is uh leah garcia you know i don't know which is the elder sister but that's that's that's how the documentation is okay great alright alright so so the reason so i don't have this happen again um could you explain that a little more yes so what happens is that for a new patient when the patient is uh you know added to the system and there is no family so you know if you add the family for this patient it means that by default the system considers this patient who you're creating the family onto as the head of the family so you cannot add this patient to another profile however you can add more patients to the profile of this patient so we had actually created uh family for both the patients which is why we were not able to add either one of them to the second one so what we got it we we we deleted the family for one patient so that there should be no family for one patient and this patient who does not have the family has been added to the patient who had the family so that's what it was okay alright alright well thank you very much not a problem at all i'm gonna go ahead and close the ticket anything else for now i can assist you with uh no that's it all right thank you so much and have a great day you too thanks bye bye goodbye"}}, {"id": 727, "data":

of printing them individually okay um let me check that give me one moment okay thank you okay so um probably not from the scheduler itself but uh you are talking about the super bills that are created already like so for a particular day you'd want all appointments that have a super bill right the superbill themselves i think you might have a report for that one second okay thank you okay so for example for today is there any provider that you have in mind um we could try like today um let's see um we could try monday the 16th sorry no sorry monday the 17th for our p a collectearo the 17th uh is this like last month no this month may 17 may 17 those super bills will not be created yeah so no so there's no way i can print out like the day of like the super bills because for super bills need to be there for the reports you know get them now for 17 their appointments but there are no super bills so okay so for example um like what if i'm going to check in the patient right um i have the option like if i click on it and it says appointment let me see well actually we try for today okay so like if i go to check on the patient today let's say for example one o'clock i'm able to print like it says super bill and it's completely empty okay do you know what i mean like i needed empty you you need an empty yeah like i don't need it filled out or anything by empty what exactly do you mean there are fields but there's nothing against them is that what you're saying yeah like there's no codes on the paper there's nothing checked off there's essentially again like there's just like all the codes are on there and um i don't need anything else but that just need the full paper no the report is meant for information that is you know they're super bill that's been created this is what you're asking is basically like an empty form that's available and this is only available per appointment you can actually print those out you know like a bulk format no i know so is there any way you can connect to my computer so i can kind of show you what i mean sure so i just go to anydesk okay i have 639 651 496 are you in okay all right so here so for example like this patient just 1 o clock patient i'm gonna go ahead and check her in for example here i'm gonna print the super bill so i need this printed out this whole sheet printed out for essentially every patient of the day

during the session and uh that's why i'm calling you no problem thank you so much for getting back to me i just know that they're the boss is antsy because that's how we pay the doctor so i just need to make sure i get this done no problem cure md is here to help can you please do a screen share session sure hold on 1 second let me get to that section i don't even know where i am right now there we go okay you need by any desk number again 128171 820 i'm sending you the request there you go okay i can see your screen now uh please open the practice okay let me take the control sure uh now the thing is that as you showed me that there is a discrepancy in the report uh we have investigated with our uh reconfiguration team and other experts as well actually uh there's no discrepancy which we have found there is just one option we are not using actually okay first i will run the bank deposits report okay if i select the doctor which we were selecting yesterday and uh i select the payment date to which i was selecting we were selecting for the month of may and if i run the report for all the locations it will show me $58 it is correct now if i if i run your end of day monthly summary now over here what we were doing wrong is that uh first let me select all the correct options selection of the location all provider this uh transaction date this month of may mhm and that is how we were actually running the report do you see that we have selected provider and we have selected resources as well so the the payments which you have received for the provider plus uh the resource payments they're all included in this report selected none i just want to see the payments which we have received for this particular provider i need to select resources none and then click print now when i'll click print this report and show you the exact amount and if i run the yearly summary it's slow sorry uh over here if i select the provider over here as you can see there is no category of resource there is i'm sorry i'm sorry so that is none search by transaction date month may and click print it will show us the same results got you and if i run the collection ratio i hope this will reconcile as well i hope you help okay we're gonna go for it we're gonna help it really stinks but i guess that's right i don't know i don't know why it's acting why it did that or why there's over here like we have like multiple options this is the reason the report may reconcile or may not okay do you know the difference difference of these options yeah they said obviously data service and the transaction date is whatever date it was put in on the charges and the system date is that if uh at the time when you put in the charges what was the system date like the system comes up on top right so that's this and the transaction date is that if you give the date range of may the transaction date will pick up the charges which were charged in these date changes and the payments you have received in these date ranges regardless of the charges okay so it will be collective so i'm selecting transaction date so that we get the payments only and the charges will be a lot more let's take a print we had june on there you gotta change it to me i'm sorry that's ok oh that wasn't very nice i clicked it off of there yeah all good okay well see the payments for the provider 58 okay got you alright well thank you so much phil i appreciate you but so now i just need to make sure that where it says resource i put none yes the resources none because uh it will it will like accumulate the total of the resources and the provider so you have to collect the resources okay sounds good thank you so much i appreciate your help you have a wonderful weekend same to you have a good day thank you you too"}}, {"id": 741, "data": {"call_id": "1621868164.1023657.txt", "text": "please enter your access to enable audio controls please enter your audio hello good morning hey good morning lee

change the password okay alright now you can go ahead and you can enter a new password for yourself alright perfect so you can go ahead and save it so you wouldn't have to enter it okay alright so this is uh once you log into curemd this is going to be your main page and this is the personal module that we're currently in where you will be able to see the messages if you know any practice users if shawnee maybe they have sent you any messages with any attachments so this is where you will be able to see those messages similarly this is the task module this is where you know if you want to create a task for yourself as a reminder or maybe if shawnee mowshay or anybody else in the practice if they have assigned you any task so this is where all those tasks will be listed now this is a completely customizable dashboard let's say if you don't wanna see your task in this section or maybe you know if you wanna see something else they can simply drag and drop it uh let's say now my notes is basically those provided notes which maybe you have created in the system or maybe somebody else has created and they have assigned them to you to review them and then sign off so if you want to customize your dashboard all you need to do is just simply just drag it and drop it on any uh column here and this is how it will appear now if you okay so if you select my notes it's gonna be it will show you those notes that you have created for any patient or for any provider and similarly assigned to me is gonna show you the ones which other providers may have assigned to you to review them and then sign off so you can have both of them so let's say if you wanna drag and drop in in section this is where you can have the provider note that has been assigned to you alright now on the left hand side there are a couple of options now similarly if you wanna jump into your inbox so you can simply click here you can also see it on the dashboard but if you wanna directly jump into the inbox to see all the messages and this is how you can simply click on inbox then you know these are some of the messages tools like if you wanna see the sent messages if you wanna see the messages that you have created and you know you haven't sent out yet so you will find them in the graph section now the task section is going to be you know this is where it's gonna show you that the task that you probably have created and they have not been started yet or if you want to add a new task for yourself or you maybe wanna sign attached to somebody else so this is where you will be able to create a new task in order to add a new one you'll simply click on the plus icon it's gonna open up this window this is where you will let's say enter the subject of the task or maybe let's say take patient vitals okay and similarly if you wanna uh you know enter any note for anyone whom you are assigning this task but if you want to enter a note for yourself maybe so this is where you can enter any kind of note now at the bottom you have the option whether you want to assign this task to yourself as a reminder you want to assign it to all the practice users all the practice users it's gonna include moshey uh jeremy shawnee anybody who is uh you know who have the credentials secure md this task will be assigned to all of them and if you want to specify the user then you can simply click on specify you click on the plus icon this window is gonna open up this is where you have the list of all the practice users that we have in march vascular database and let's say if you want to sign a task to shawnee maybe you can simply select her name and that's how you will be able to sign a task now let's say you are assigning a task which is uh you know related to a patient you are telling shawnee to take patient vitals so you can also specify the patient charge with that particular task so you can simply click on specify and once you click on the plus icon is gonna open up this window now these are all the patient records okay so whichever patient record you want to associate with this task you can simply attach it so let's just go ahead and open up a test patient and close the window once you're done you can attach multiple patient charts as well and you can just go ahead and click on the save button and there you go you have a new task this is the patient uh for which you have created a task you have assigned this task to shawnee and this is where you're seeing that that uh you know the task was assigned to whichever user it is similarly if you are assigned any task you will be able to see those tasks in the same section and once shawnee has completed the task this task will automatically disappeared and it will be moved to the complete bucket okay and sorry one question these tasks will pop up on my on my initial homepage under the task section exactly exactly so if we go back to the home button uh there you go so this is a new tab that you have created it's showing you the date and uh you know the time and data and uh the person who has assigned the task similarly once you have a new task for yourself this is gonna appear uh it's gonna appear in the same section alright now on the left hand side this is where we have a couple of more options i'm not gonna go into too much detail now erx this is something that you would probably use more often now new rx activity is going to show you the prescriptions that you have sent out using so you will you uh we can allow you the permissions that you know uh if if you want to send out prescriptions on doctor's behalf so you will also be able to do it and whenever you send out any prescription this is where that prescription will be queued it's gonna be in the queue for a couple of minutes and then it will automatically be sent out to the pharmacy that you have selected at the time of uh prescribing the medication we will cover that part in the clinical training okay now similarly under orders and results now this is where we have the labs procedures radiology now these are the radiology orders that have been placed now if you go to pending orders this is where you will be able to see all the orders that are in pending this is where you will simon we are not using this order section um like we discussed we have that custom order template for the radiology orders um and then we use the follow up section as part of our workflow to follow up for radiology so we really don't use the order section okay alright uh so let's just go ahead and skip this part um other than that you have my notes then again it's gonna show you the provider known that have been created by other providers uh other practice users so these are all the provider notes that you can see now let's just say if you want to see the provider notes which are you know left in the draft status so you can simply choose the status as draft click on the third button and it's gonna show you all the provider notes which are not currently signed and they are in the draft okay if you want to see any provider note you can simply click on the data visit and it's gonna take you in that provide a note this is how you will be able to review the note okay and if you are to sign the provider note then you do have the permissions you can simply click on sign and this note will be signed okay okay um and how do i how would i open let's say a new note to like to write about a patient that i just saw uh yes so that is a part of our training i will come to that once we start the third section of this training which is on provider notes okay got it okay alright um other than that we have a couple of other options under my preferences now my preferences basically is a user specific settings okay so if you go under my preference and you know if you go into general these are the different options that you can um you know let's just say if you want the default landing page to be anything different so the default landing pages something as soon as you log into cure m d you are taken to the home module okay if you want that to be different if you want to see the scheduler maybe or you know if you want to uh leave it to personal then you can simply just leave it as it if you have selected scheduler then as soon as you log into cure m d it will automatically takes you to the scheduler module which is you know the third module from the top and that's where you will be able to see the calendar for doctors and similarly uh this is then again for the patients uh so whenever you open any patient's chart whether you want to see the patient basic demographics which is the patient name address phone number and things like that or you want to see the patient's clinical chart which is which is going to include the allergies the history the vitals provider notes that have been created for that patient so i believe that you will be uh working on clinical side more often so we can set this as clinical overreview if that's okay and then the default personal pages something let's say when you click on this home button what do you want to see you wanna see your dashboard you wanna see your inbox you wanna see the tasks that have been assigned to you so that's how you will be able to configure all that other than that there are just a few options which i'm gonna check off for your um user so this is what i've done is whenever you go to the scheduler module it will automatically takes you to the current date okay so you wouldn't have to select the date and then see the calendar for that date alright now moving on to the patient section under preferences this is also uh an interesting part now whenever let me just go ahead and quickly open a new patients chart and then i can uh you know demonstrate this how this works so i'm just gonna go ahead and open a patient chart okay now once you are in the patient chart you see the configuration that we did was to clinical overview as soon as you open a patient chart it's showing you the patient allergies the diagnosis histories medication and you know the provider notes now there is another setting to it like if you want what information you wanna see on top uh when you open a patient's chart so this is a patient banner where you can see the basic information like the patient's name date of birth the account number home phone and things like that now this is where you will be able to configure all that so once you open a patient's chart do you wanna see the patients home phone or maybe the patients mobile phone okay so office number is very rarely capture it's normally the mobile phone so i normally decided to home phone and mobile phone then similarly if you want to see the patient allergies as soon as you open a patient's chart so you you can see the patient allergies on the patient banner okay yeah um similarly uh expand pre menu and drag now this is something let's let's take you back to the patient chart and once you get in the patient's chart you see that all of these left pre menu items they are you know collapse they are not expanded you have to make a click and then the the field is going to be expanded so this is where you can you know set that lets say whenever you open a chart you want the registration section to be pre expanded provider note clinical and appointment and once we click on save and if we reopen the patient's chart you notice that the left hand side options they are pre expanded and all you need to do is just make one click to any of the clinical item and it's gonna take you there so it's just gonna save you the number of clicks okay okay alright um other than that there are just a couple of more options let's say under uh vitals if you don't need the pulse section if you don't need that aspiration section temperature blood pressure and so on and so forth so you can simply leave it un check checking them off is not gonna make them mandatory it's just gonna give you another field under the vital section to document that information but if you're gonna leave it un check that's not gonna show up and even if it show up and you know if you leave it empty then it's not going to be mandatory system will still let you uh save the vitals for the patient okay okay same goes for the social history so under in curemd under social history uh the p the three uh standard um history components are tobacco drug abuse and um uh give me one there's another one other than that these are some optional uh items which you want you may enable or you can disable so this is just gonna make them disappear when your uh documenting the patients uh social history and similarly even if they are enabled and if you leave them empty then it's not it's a non mandatory field so you system will let you skip that information and still save the patient's social history okay got it yeah okay other than that um we have another important option which is the quick links now quickly is something that you're seeing on top okay now if anything that you think is important to you let's say whenever you have created a new provide a note and if it's unsigned then system is gonna give you a prompt on top that you know 1 2 or maybe whatever the number to provide a note that are unsigned you can see the number on the top similarly um you may have sent out an electronic prescription and due to some reasons maybe the patients phone number or maybe the patient address was missing and the prescription didn't go through so there's going to be an error in the prescription so you can see those errors on top okay so once i hit save it has given you you know uh the new quick links now this is where you can directly jump to that particular module okay alright and so that is pretty much it about the uh the uh you know the dashboard do you have any questions so far on the dashboard section no okay alright now the next module that we are going to cover it as the patient module now uh as the name suggests itself uh in patient module you will be able to see all the patient records if you want to modify any of the patient record you that's what you will be able to do if you want to add a new patient in the system so this is the place where you will be able to do all that now once you click the patient's module it's gonna take you to the screen now this is a standard search by default it will take you to the standard search where you will be able to look up for patient by maybe entering their first name or you can enter their last name or you can enter their account number and you will be able to look up for that patient other than that you can enter any phone number and you will be able to find out the patient and if you want to switch to the advance mode than these are multiple options with which you can look up for a patient it could either be with the social security number you can search the patient by their insurance policy number and you know multiple other criteria which you can look up for a patient in the system okay yeah all right now let's just go ahead and add a new patient so in order to add a new one um but before i do that so the on the left hand side you see the patient hot list now the hot list is in in hot list you will see those patients whose chart you have most recently open so recently we just opened the chart for josh test so it's it's you know it's coming under patient heartless so whenever you come to the patient module and if you see the patient you know is appearing in the hot list you can just simply click it and it's gonna take you to the patients charge so you don't have to look up for that patient alright now let's just go ahead and add a new patient in order to add one just click on the add button and this page is gonna open up okay alright so these are the different fields while registering patients uh are mandatory the ones that you see with this odd staric so these are the the mandatory information that you have to enter in order to save a patient's chart um other than that you see that there is a blue staric as well now these are non mandatory i mean if you skip the address it will give you the prompt when you save the patient however you can come back to the patient chart and you can then update the address as well okay all right now you can go ahead and take the mouse controlled and let's just go and uh quickly fill out the test patient you can register yourself uh just enter the last name is test okay now one important thing now you see the location so this is where you're going to select the location uh so vascular they have a couple of location in the system so wherever this patient will be coming for that appointment so that location will be selected at this point oh got it okay and that again is a mandatory field so you have to select uh one of the locations before you save the patient record so we just pick any random uh for now you can pick any yes but that's it so we saved we pretty much saved everything so we needed to save yep mhm alright so if you scroll all the way to the top you will have an option to save it the only other thing i would mention here which is not a mandatory um its not a mandatory field in curemd but it's something that we always fill in if you go down to the um there is the primary and referring provider um each home that we service has a provider that is the primary care referring provider at that home um so you'll get to know them as you're working in each home you'll know who the doctor is for each home so we always we always enter the referring provider of the primary care provider so what is the referring provider always the primary care provider and it's always the same but enter it in both fields okay got it okay okay so let's just quickly generally this won't be generally this won't be something you'll be doing anyway or data entry team typically we'll have all the patients information entered in the form already so when you go to see the patient they should be in there but if for any reason if they just brought in a new patients in the home and they weren't on our rafter yet um and they want you to check out the patient if there's some chance they bring you a new patient is not in the program you'll just right away enter it on the spot and see the patient um but generally you won't be having to do that okay got it okay go ahead simon all right perfect so uh you can go ahead and you can save the patient alright wonderful okay so as you noticed that once you have saved the patient you have a couple of more options on the top and then you know you have the left hand uh side as well where you have all the clinical items i want the patient is registered then you will be able to you know update their insurances you can update their emergency contact information so i'll get to that part as well um okay uh so shawnee can you confirm one thing are you guys uh capturing any uh phone number mobile or home no phone number is not important okay alright perfect the address is because we always want us to show up on the um on the billing um on the claim form but the phone number is not necessary okay perfect alright so alright so uh ella so when you're entering the zip code so you you don't have to enter the city sorry sorry can you hear me hello yep you're fading in and out um can can you hear me now yes yes all right perfect so i was mentioning that when you're taking the patient's address uh address so all you need is you know this address field and then you have to enter the zip code after entering the zip code it's recommended that you click on the zip hyperlink and system will automatically fill in the city and uh you know the state information so let me just see so let's say if i change the zip code and if you click this so if you know if there are multiple so you can simply pick the correct one and that's how city and state will automatically be filled in alright so can you go ahead and please enter the zip code again uh that was before yeah okay alright there you go okay after you have entered the patient chart um there are a couple of other options so once a new patient is registered in curemd and later on if you want to delete that record so you will not be able to completely remove the patient patient chart from the system because there is some reference data which is associated whenever a new patient is created so that's why you cannot permanently delete the patient chart from the system however if need be you can mark the patient as inactive so in order to do that you simply click on this button and this window is gonna open up whatever the reason for marking the patient as inactive is so you can simply selected from the drop down and uh you know this will sorry to interrupt ellie this will periodically happen like if you go back to see a patient that we've been that we've seen multiple times and possibly the patient is deceased uh or was transferred out for whatever reason has marked as inactive that we're no longer seeing then and and mark it deceased or whatever okay yeah okay yeah so so that way we no longer we know that we no longer have to track that patient and you know because reschedule them and things like that we know that they're no longer after okay got it alright so if you select the reason is deceased and system is gonna ask you for the date of death as well so this is where you can document that too okay alright um other than that you have an option to mark the patient as a red flag it could be for any reason so once you click on mark as red flag that are a couple of uh preloaded reasons so let's say if the confidential patient or you know whatever the reason is they can simply selected or if you want to add a new reason you can simply click on the plus icon its gonna give you a blank field and that's how you will be able to add a new reason so let's say if i want to market as a confidential patient and if you save it so you notice that there is gonna be this red flag right next to the patient charge and even when you search this patient um you know uh just give me one moment okay whenever you will search for the patients who are red flags so they're gonna come up in red and right next to it there's going to be this flag as well and if you hover your mouse on okay once you have once you open the patient's chart and you hover your your mouse its gonna show you the reason as well for the patient being red flag so at the bottom you can see that that confidential patient okay um alright uh then this is uh this is something that i will come back to later once we have the patience insurance updated and then similarly if you want to print the patient demographic or if you wanna uh fax out the patient uh patient chart so these are some other options and then the logs are gonna show you if you know if any recent changes have been made to the patient's chart so once you click on log so let me show you an example so let's say initially when you created the patient record so this this was alright so alright no problem take your time okay we're good okay alright so initially when you added this patient so this was the information added and later on we change this information to let's say this one so this is the second log oops i'm sorry i accidentally click somewhere else its okay alright so once you click here so whatever the changes we have made so as you can see that previously uh you know we change the zip code so that's how it's showing us that this information was changing the patient chart recently and similarly this log so you know we changed uh you know we added the red flag so it's it's gonna highlight that what information exactly what's changing the patient's chart so that is pretty much it about these options and then there are some other tabs on the top so let's go to insurance now this is where if you want to update uh patients insurance primaries secondaries so this is where you will be able to add that in order to add you'll simply just click on the add button and these are all the plans that you have in the system so whatever the patient's insurances is you will simply select it whatever the address is you will select that this is where you will enter the patient's policy number okay and ellie this is generally not going to be your job to do this is more of the data entry billing team um but it is important for you to know where the insurance information is found so for example if you see a patient and you're right away want to send them for imaging um you know if there are medicare medicaid patients they certainly don't need any um authorization if you see that they have some sort of hmo that might need an authorization before we do imaging you might say okay let's hold office global office see if we need to get an authorization um before you just send them right over to the imaging tax if you look on the insurance tab straight medicare patient you could send them right over so um for purposes like that it might be important for you to just be aware like where you could find their insurance um you know their insurance coverages um but you won't really be entering the the data okay okay thanks alright okay so once we have entered the data so that's how it's gonna show up and similarly as you can see that on the patient banner uh the patient's primary or whatever the patient's insurances so this is where it's going to appear to okay yeah alright now under contacts is going to be the patient emergency contact so uh if you want to see who is the responsible party for the patients so you can should i skip this yeah you can skip contacts um and yeah most of us don't really need uh the consents it's something uh then again i think uh ellies not gonna take so should i cover this part this is really gonna be more of the office um handling all this stuff i think we could get more clinical stuff and notes that he's gonna be dealing with all right perfect uh now before i continue to the clinical part uh shawnee can you confirm if uh ella is going to be added as a provider is it gonna be seeing his own patients or he will no he's gonna be um listed under rami because he's a pa so everything's gonna be billed out under rami um so he's not being added as a separate provider okay and uh would there be a separate calendar required for ella um possibly down the road the way we set one up for irena maybe set one up like that um but for right now for right now you can just leave it under rami okay alright so let's just go ahead and move to um i'm briefly gonna cover the scheduling part and then i'll take you directly to the clinical intake okay okay great alright now in order to book an appointment uh so this is the the scheduler module uh and similarly if you want to see doctors calendar so you can simply just go to the scheduler and uh so now this is where you're going to pick the location that with for which location you want to see the calendar for doctors and when you have selected the location and you will select the name of the provider and it's gonna open up the calendar as you can see that amber court or brooklyn uh doctor do have a calendar for today but there is no such appointment similarly on 19 there were like five appointments so uh the yellow ones is actually representing that this calendar is partially filled so uh on 19 there were five appointments on 16 there were eight appointments and so on and so forth and the one that you're seeing completely green means that there are slots available but there is no appointment scheduled on that slot as of yet okay got it alright now let's just quickly go ahead and book an appointment so in order to book one you just have to select the slot so let's say if you want to book an appointment on 1145 so you will simply click here and this window is gonna pop up now if you want to book an appointment for you know any patient so you're simply just gonna search by the patient's name or you know these different criterias alright now once you have looked up for the patient this window will open up this is for a reason for appointment will be selected so let's say if it's a new patient so this this is definitely gonna be done by the front desk people so let's just quickly schedule this appointment now let's just assume that appointment is scheduled for today 1145 and when the patient is gonna come in so your front desk they will be the one responsible to check the patient in so this is what they would normally do then again this is not your part but i'm just showing you that what is going to be generally the ma that's assisting you will check in the patient take the basic information and you know um they'll probably even doing vitals get the patient and get them ready and then and then you're gonna start entering you know you know information into the notes so this will generally be done by the ma thats assisting you got it all right so let's say your m a checked in the appointment now once the appointment is checked in now this is the screen uh so you see this today's patient now this is going to be your queue this is where you will be able to monitor when patient is ready to see you when patient is going to be coming to you so my recommendation is to keep the screen open at all times because this is where you know this screen actually auto refresh itself every 60 seconds so you will you will be able to see that which patients are coming in and are being checked in uh ashawnee can you confirm one thing when the patient is ready for provider how is that being uh notified by the medical assistance or the front desk staff to the provider are the changing the status is or is it verbal its verbal they're all they're always in a small space they just let the notifications running mhm okay alright so there is another way to do it i mean i can just give you a suggestion so if you want to implement that in the practice that's your call so let's say when the patients are ready for the provider so currently the patient is at check in stage now at check in let's say the patient is currently signing off the consent forms or you know whatever patients supposed to do with the front desk so that is being done at check in stage and when patient is ready for the provider so the the front desk or medical assistance they can change uh the status to exam okay wants to do that this is gonna pop up now this can be a queue for the providers that patient is now ready to see them all the clinical intake the vitals everything has been taken care of and they can uh the patient can be getting to them any minute now so providers can just go ahead and open the note before the patient arrives and that is something that is also customizable so let's say if you cannot keep a track of status is and you can assign any status of color as well so whenever you see that color of this appointment is like this yellow so that means that patient is now ready to be with you and you can go ahead and you can create the note for that patient okay alright now in order to create a note all you need to do is you just simply click on the create note button and it will take you to this page now this is where you will take that if it's a new patient appointment okay so you can see the visit reason uh it's automatically selected since when the appointment was booked so that's when uh the front desk people they select the visit reason so this is going to be your queue that which provider note template you would be using for this this particular visit so for new patient appointments uh practices using initial with a note so you will simply select that other than that you don't need to change anything on this page all we need to do is just select the note template and click on create um can we just run through those note templates and visit reasons for a second so um sure no you can just drop down the account uh just give me one moment let me just uh remove the note can you just drop down i know that it's gonna be greyed out because uh the reason is already selected okay okay there you go do you drop down the visit reasons um so we have cancelled our new patient follow up um imaging procedures um telehealth we do early but if you do a telehealth visit then if you mark it that way it'll just stand out to us so we know to telehealth um um procedures are for when you're doing either um when we're doing the vaccine injections or when we're doing a procedure in the lab um new patient or consult is you know when we're doing an initial consult follow up is for any follow up visit there after um and imaging they use when they do the radiology imaging um and then the note templates so we have um arterial patient clinic is when they're doing something in the lab procedure um initial visit note follow up note and we've created all these templates based on round me likes to have in each of these notes we have a radiology visit us again for the imaging tina um um templates for doing the um right okay um venus station clinic company i think is when they're doing a case in the versus when we're doing the vaccine injections okay yeah i got it okay great um you can go ahead well so just one thing to know um there's a no charge uh fax that you could check off there um it's like some chance you um and you can uh simon will show you in a minute how you get back to this area like once you're in the note you could drop down that orange arrow and get back to the section if you ever seeing a patient let's say you create a note and you're doing an initial consult but for some reason the patient walks that after five minutes they're not interested or you go in to see a patient and they create a note and then uh you're told all the patients not coming down he's deceased and you just want to put a note into the chart patient deceased as of such and such date uh no longer available or you want to put a note in uh came to see this patient patient was transferred out to the hospital as of such and such date with such and such condition um whatever if you're putting in some sort of note but it's not a charge visit right like you didn't actually see the patient there wasn't actually a chargeable event but you're just being in more informational note into the chart as to what happened while you didn't see the patient then just mark the appointment there's no charge so that we don't bill for it okay got it okay okay go ahead simon alright now uh let's just go ahead and pick the initial with that note and in order to create you simply just click on the create button alright now once you created the notes so that's how the provider note going to look like so on top you have the patients basic information then you have the complaint section so these are the different back okay yeah i got it if you need to change anything there you could change it okay got it thanks okay all right so um these are the different components uh so the blue hyper links that you're seeing so these are the clinical component some of them are custom forms uh then they have we have the review of system uh then we have modern vascular screening forms so these are the different clinical items that you will be able to fill out directly from the provider note um so shawnee can you confirm if any of this information will be uh for new patients if any of this information will be pre filled uh by medical assistant like any allergies or histories or vitals and things like that yes do they will do before they'll they'll ask even so i think usually the p a will just review whatever you any medications they'll ask again they'll confirm that everything's in there but sometimes the m a will start taking some of this information and doing some of the screening but the p a usually goes through it one more time just confirms everything okay so uh the the blue hyperlink that you're seeing currently that means that no information has been entered into these sections of the patient's chart so that's why you know no data is being showed up now let's just assume that uh before you have created this provider note before the patient came to you uh medical assistant they have documented the patient's medical history they entered surgical they entered what the current medications that patients are so all that information will auto populate in front of you if you want to make any changes i i will show you that how you can otherwise all the information is going to be there already and you will just have to you know uh just add a few some of some of the information on the note and you're done with it so let's just start from the top so this is where you can enter the patient complaints so once you click on the complaint section this window is gonna open up so once you hover your mouse on the start button is gonna show you the favorite complaint list so once you click it so whatever the favorite the most commonly used complaints by the practices are so all those complaints will appear otherwise you have a search library that this is where you can you know always looking for any other complaint and if it's in the application library then you will be able to see it and you can simply just click on it so let's just go ahead and pick a few from the list of favorites let's say breakdown alright so as you can see so i have selected breakdown as a complaint now with each complaint you will have this bunch of questionnaire there's some some check boxes some drop down that you can pick from now none of this information is mandatory this is only for your convenience whichever information you want to document you can if you want to skip any of it you can so let's say um if it's bilateral if it's left lower leg so that's how you will be able to select all of that it's aggravated by these items it's released by when you know patient is giving a massage what is the pattern so if you wanna skip pattern if you wanna skip status or any other field so you can um similarly once you have you're done documenting uh the items for breakdown so let's say patient also have mentioned anything about leg cramps or they have you know new skin change whichever complaints patient is mentioning so that that's how you can select them in the complaint section and once you hit accept that's how you complaint is gonna show up on your provider note okay great alright similarly while you're on the complaint section if you want to go back to the note you will hit the accept button and it's gonna take you back and similarly if you want to jump to the next item so let's say after complaints we have previous treatments and conser conservative measures so you can simply just click on the next button and whichever item is next in line will automatically appear that's how you can select you know whatever the procedure is click click click and you can jump on to the next part now the next item is review system by default that's how the review system is uh created whenever you have a new patient if anything is anything needs to be changed so let's say under general able to conduct usual activities is marked as positive that means patient agrees to it that they are able to conduct usual activities if they're not you can simply just mark it as negative similarly patient disagrees to fatigue so that already have been checked off as negative these are the common uh the common item that normally are they already have been checked off but if you think that you know this needs to be changed so you can always you know make the selection accordingly similarly if patient is mentioning fevers that's how you can select the positive side if not then you can select the negative part similarly under eyes you have different options uh by default uh blurred vision is checked off as negative and similarly if patient is describing double vision so you can simply mark it as positive and similar to that we have a couple of other systems on top and as you select any one of them you have different options you can uh choose from and once you hit accept it's gonna take you back to the note and that's how your review system is gonna look like so under general patient admits that they are able to conduct usual activities patient admits fatigue fever and chills but patient denies night sweats so that's how your review of system will appear on the provider note i like that that's actually a pretty cool feature yep alright so after that we have modern vascular screening so these are this is a questionnaire uh you know that you can fill out with the patient based on their answers you can simply select yes or no let's just quickly go ahead and fill this out alright so once you have done the screening once you have selected everything all you need to do is just hit the accept button and previously it was just a blue hyperlink but now you have filled it out so it's gonna replace it with you know whatever options you have selected okay alright alright now the next section that we have is medical history now then again if medical history is already taken by the medical uh assistance then you know you will be able to see that information and you can just review it and if anything needs to be updated so that's how you can do it so let's say um let's see if we have any favorite list yeah we do so let's say patient mentioned uh you know hypertension asthema so so all you need to do is just click click click and that they will be added into the patient's medical history and if anything is unavailable then you can always look up in the library uh let's say as you gonna start typing system will start giving you the suggestions and you simply select it and hit accept so that's how your medical medical history will be uh will will show up now similarly this is how it will appear if this information was already taken by medical assistant and if you wanna review it or if you want to you know make any changes to it uh just give me one moment okay uh just give me one moment please uh just sure alright if you want to make any changes so you can simply reopen it let's say if you want to take out hitting loss you can if you want to add anything else you can you can do that and once you hit accept that's how it will be updated same goes for the surgical uh surgical history social history and family history let's just quickly go ahead and review these options too so after medical history we have surgical history we have common surgeries available um but the list is empty so we can just go ahead and we can look it up but then again if you have a list of favorites you know in in uh in allergies and medical history and diseases anything that you are most commonly gonna use so you can let us know and we can create a list for you okay mm okay let's say this for the surgery done in the past they can simply enter that and move on to the next part okay so the next item that we have is the patient medication now in order to add a new medication in the patient's chart you will simply click on the add button okay um favorite medications okay the list is empty so let's say the patient says that you know they are taking currently aspirin whatever the uh you know uh the dosage patient is taking so that's how you can enter similarly tylanol so if you're gonna start typing in system will start giving you the suggestions and once you have selected all the medication patient is currently on so that that's how they will be cute at the bottom and once you hit the save button they will be added to the patient's chart okay and similarly let's say you added tylanol in error and and you want to discontinue this medication so you can simply select that one before i do that let me show you how medications are gonna appear okay so that's how once you have added the current medication so this is how it will appear on the provider note and similarly let's say if any medication was added in error let's say tylenol so you can simply click on it you can either delete it completely or if you want to discontinue this medication they can click on discontinue you can select the reason like you know it's void or you know uh patient dislike it or whatever the reason is and if there is no reason listed and you can always select other and you can enter the description in uh the description section okay and that's how the medication will be taken out okay now this medication has been moved to past so if you want past medications to be shown on your provider note so you can simply select them and click on accept now if you know the system is not only showing you the current medication but also the uh the past medication as well what was the reason it was discontinued you have everything uh you know on you provider note normally past medications are not required on the provider note so you can simply just you don't have to manually do it every time once you move it to pass it will it will be it will only show your current medication by default but if you need them then you can simply check them off and they will appear then we have the allergies now if there is no known drug allergy then you can simply check it off and you can move on to the next part otherwise if there is an allergy reported by the patient so that's how you can uh you know enter the patient alright and similarly once you have selected the allergy if you want to document you know the severity if you want to document that what are the adverse reaction against that allergies then you can also do that otherwise these are non mandatory so you can if you want to skip this just by adding uh you know peanut butter so you can also do that okay alright so red um okay so once you click on accept alright then the next item that we have is the social history so these are the different tabs like i mentioned tobacco alcohol and drug so these are the standard um standard social history sexual occupational and so on and so forth these are uh you know if if you want to take out these tabs then this can be done under the my preferences section otherwise if you don't want to document anything under it then you can leave it empty and it's uh not gonna show up on you provider note anyway so let's say patient is a smoker so we can select the current status we can select what type of cigarettes so then again as you can see none of the field is mandatory for your own extensive documentation is required then you can simply move on to the next one let's say patient denies the alcohol usage and let's say patient mentioned that these are the drugs the patient is on and you can simply click on accept alright so that's how the social history will be documented and the same for uh you know family history as well so i'm gonna skip that part then we have the patient vitals now then again if vitals were taken by the medical assistance before you open the note so you will be able to see the vitals otherwise that's how you can document that information if you want to enter the patient's weight you can similarly if you want to enter the height you can otherwise you see that none of the information on the vital pages mandatory even if you just wanna uh you know skip by entering the the weight and height you will be able to do it but if you want to take the pulse so let's say you enter the pulse information temperature that's why i'm gonna skip blood pressure so once i hit accept only the information that you have entered that will appear on your provider note okay then this is the physical exam so this is also preloaded by by default most commonly used values by doctors shartavi have been selected as default but if you think anything is abnormal then you can simply just uh you know make those changes and once you hit accept they will be they will appear on the provider note accordingly okay alright now comes the important part now this diagnosis section is really important because this is where you will enter the icd 10 codes and these codes are actually going to carry forward on the e super bill page where you know shawnee is gonna do the billing so this is very important that you enter the accurate information in the section so once you click on diagnosis this window will open up then you click on the add button now once you have clicked on add my recommendation is to enable this pfd button now this is the provider friendly terminology once you enable it all you need to do is enter a keyword and system will give you the accurate icd 10 codes okay let's say you have entered can you show him the favorites because i have favorites listed for each of these this is important actually okay so this is the list of favorites so i have favorites for follow up for initial consult for procedures so there are certain codes like if we're billing vericena we have to bill certain there are certain diagnosis codes that you bill for vericena clear okay there are others that are allowed but i put the most common ones that you would use so if you're doing a vericena procedure put in one of these diagnosis you find there's something that is that there's really nothing that's applicable which wouldn't really happen but if you find it really these are not applicable and you need a different code um you can let me know but generally like these are the common codes that we use for vericena that makes sense okay great okay and the same with um initial consult we have the ones that are very common um okay so diabeties um hypertension these are like the common ones these are the ones that are very commonly used sufficiency obviously okay these are the ones that comfortable okay okay okay and then you can always search and add other ones especially like for initial regular visits you know you could put in any codes um but like for specific things like radiology um like emitting their specific diagnosis codes which i'll show you when we get to that template and for varicena um the radiology code they'll show him how we set it up on the uh radiology order templates so so we'll see what i mean by that okay okay so this is this is good for diagnosis um alright so whichever diagnosis you wanna select from the favorite list so you will simply just click on it and you can see that they are being queued at the bottom let's say if you have added anything in error so you can simply just remove it before saving it and once you click on the save button so these current diagnosis will be added to the patient's chart and once you get it mhm got you got you could you stack i c d 10 codes or they don't like that like meaning you get the bill higher for if you stack i c d 10 codes or not because i know like let's say and like in pediatrics they let's say they don't put in the emergency room i can stack it and they get the bill more i mean for not really i mean for um for like initial consult for billing the same fee you know whether they have four diagnosis is there you know um more by the like lab procedures if they were complicated thing but then it's it's really this is really go not based on the diagnosis but more based on um more based on the uh the procedure code like what actual procedure at the visit um but i will tell you like for an initial visit if i see that they have you know a bunch of diagnosis then we ordered radiology and they actually see an issue we'll bill more of like a 9944 which is like a higher level initial consult it was a very basic appointment they didn't really show anything and we didn't even order imaging i'll i'll drop it down to a 99203 um but that's more based on like if you actually saw an issue when we ordered imaging or like if the patient didn't have anything going on okay got it um okay go ahead simon alright okay so once you hit accept and it's gonna take you back to the provider note and that's how you can see the current diagnosis updated on the provider note now as you're adding all this information you notice that you know this information is also available on the left hand side so let's say if any information is unavailable on the note uh like if i remove the diagnosis then you still will be able to see the current diagnosis of this patient from uh on the right hand side same goes for the histories as well so commonly on the follow up note all the histories are not available so if you want to have a quick peek then you can simply click on history and this is where you can see all that information then we have the education um okay so uh shawnee can you confirm if education educational handouts are being given to the patient sometimes they'll document here if they've educated the patient on smoking or educated the patient compression stocking there are noted something here under education that they canceled the patients regarding certain things it was uh non smoking things like okay so once you hit education this window is gonna open up and for this patient if you wanna give out any educational handouts to click on add um then you will simply just look up for let's say hypertension uh okay let's let's just take this one all right so you looked up for a hiper lipidemia and once if if you wanna take a quick peek then you can also view the education by clicking on this button and you can see that this information is available on this particular hand out after that you can just simply just print it out and give it to the patient or uh you can email it to the patient and whatever the level of understanding of patient is if patient let's say refused education you can also do that um other after that all you have to do is just click on the sign button it's gonna enter your name and date and time stamp that this education was given to the patient but they refused it and once you hit the save button that's how it will be updated in the patient's chart yeah i'm not sure if they actually do it through this section because i don't think they actually give them handouts but i do think that under maybe the um like their notes they'll just document that we spoke to the patient balance can we canceled them whatever that's something that after randy will go over when he when he uh gives you a little bit more guidance on how he likes to do the notes what he likes to be included in there um help over with you you know what we sort of documents as far as each of these things okay okay um then this next section is important this patient history and treatment that's something that i just set up with simon um that's around me like certain things to be carrying forward from one note to the next so this is gonna be a permanent secsion so whatever you put down in here will carry to the future notes so for example if he's doing varicenn a today on 5 24 then when he's gonna do it again next month let's say 6 24 he wants the note to um you know the previous treatments that they did so um instead of having to go back to the other notes and see when did they have vericenna on noted on the you know this will just say um you know 5 24 there you know what whatever it was um so the the information that he likes to be permanent in the chart we put into this section and this will carry forward from one note to the next to the next um as far as um even the procedure news i believe so every i think every note except for like imaging notes are stand alone but i'm like consults follow up procedures these notes are going to carry forward um so again rammy will discuss with you exactly what he likes to be here versus what what you know um in the other sections of the note but certain things that he wants to be permanent we'll have to go into this section okay got it and then you'll see if you create like a follow up note c exception showing up patient history treatment and it has information from the previous date that's why it's showing up there it's carrying from a previous note okay okay now the next section the mad vascular radiology order this is how we order radiology so if you see the patient and you see where this patient's gonna need to be scanned most commonly would be there the 93925 which is the arterial scan or the 93970 which is the vienna scan um you know but you know there are occasionally others what you do is you click you click the checkbox on the scan that you want and then you click the diagnosis code so i included under each scan like the favorite diagnosis codes that are applicable to that c p t codes so that when i bill it if i bill that c p t with those diagnosis codes it will get approved because every scan if you just include like let's say a general like um i .9 that won't necessarily work for like that won't work for a 93,970 scan so i wanna make sure that for each scan your including the diagnosis code that will actually work when we bill it um okay um so when you click on that and then let's say simon select the diagnosis any diagnosis um and then you save it so this is what the tech is gonna use when they create their imaging though when they go to do the scan or the m a who's assisting them they'll create an imaging note and they're gonna use this cpt code and those diagnosis code that's gonna carry through the imaging note um so they're gonna go based off of whatever you put here okay okay um okay and then there are procedure codes this is again there's a favorite list for each type of visit um so if you do an initial consult you'll do generally the default for an initial consult is the 99204 again like sometimes we'll downgrade it to it's 99203 it's really it was very like there's not really much going on if the patient doesn't have any you know doesn't need any imaging doesn't have anything but generally will default to 99204 um we also have the 93923 code there which is for an at will do an abi um test at the consult so if you do an abi test at the consult you include that code um and then we also have you know favorite list for each of the other type of visit follow up um if you want to click down uh follow up usually we default to the 99213 again there's also an abi code there because sometimes they didn't do the abi at the initial consult they'll do an a b i at the follow up um do we have there um if you click down the favorite list so we have the varicenna codes um if you click down to the varicenna okay those are the code we use for the varicenna injections um okay you can always search the master list that there's other things that you want to include there but these are generally the things that we're billing okay got it okay great alright so once you have so this is also one of the most important part the diagnosis uh what we covered and you know uh in this part of the icd 10 codes and the procedure cpt codes so it's really important that you uh you know mentioned the correct information and you always enter the details in these fields so this is getting forwarded in uh on the e super bowl section where it's going to be very useful for uh for shawnee no cpt code and a diagnosis i can't bill so these two things definitely need to be filled out um all the clinical stuff with the things that really will discuss with rami and he will explain to you what he likes clinical standpoint but from um the author's administrative standpoint from my side i really need the procedures and the diagnosis entered properly and then the follow up which is right below that um how we track our patient so simon will show you if you click on the follow up every single time you see a patient you need to select the follow up because we need to know what the next step is and this is how we track them so for example if you consult the patient and then you say they need radiology then you do a follow up visit for radiology because then we go to the follow up section and we could generate a report of all the patients that need to follow up for radiology so that way we can look up and say okay we have 10 patients that need radiology action will schedule a day for the text to go down there and do radiology or if they've had radiology and then the imaging test will see that there is um there's um response or something and she's gonna tell us that they need an injection or they need a procedure she's gonna after imaging note she's gonna follow up for procedure and that way we know okay this patient needs to get scheduled for a procedure and this is how we track the patients and we keep our scheduling going because logistically it's very hard to track we have patients and 30 different homes go up to a different you know stage and then after they do a procedure that we put a follow up for um for like a re consult or we do usually follow up for radiology because they need to get a re scan after the procedure um so after the varicenna they'll get a follow up for radiology so that way we know to schedule them to get re scan um and then after the tech re scans them and they'll just follow up maybe for procedure again if they need to do another bein so this is how we keep them moving to our system and if you follow up they might follow up um you know and then obviously we always do double checks and we run through all our patients at each home and always check check that everybody's up to where they need to be up to but that's more of a manual check um and we'll catch something if they get lost but ideally we want them to not get lost firstly if we want everybody being within this follow up workflow so that we keep tracking what they need next um so you'll still have a follow up visit um and then you could select the reason um if you um i don't know i dropped down the reason code either for a follow up visit a procedure an injection or radiology what they need to follow up for um so that will this will enable the patient to move to the next step okay um and then you could always put something in the notes so if you select um follow up for radiology if you want to put in the note um if you want to put in the note um you know uh vein study or whatever it is you could do that um if you select you know for varicenna and you want to speak in the note which vein they're gonna do whatever it is if you select venus injection you could put anything in the note also it's important to note here that you can mark walk priority high priority low priority normal so let's say you see a patient that like they need a procedure done tomorrow it's like really really urgent it's something that really needs to be dealt with right away you can mark it as high priority so that way we'll it'll alert us that we have to deal with that um okay so um yes so high priority notes reason code i'm just thinking if there's anything else here that you would need to mark off um so shawnee are they supposed to select the follow up date you can select the date but generally um that's probably the office because we're gonna we're gonna schedule the date meaning you're not gonna know yet when you have to follow up when we have someone coming in to do radiology but when we see we have 10 people on your follow up for radiology we'll schedule a date and and put it down so as long as you just leave any date in there that's fine if you want to put in a date two weeks from now if you do varicenna and they need to re scan in a week you could put the date for a week from now and we'll schedule it somewhere there about you know not not necessarily on the exact date that you started um but if they need to follow up in two weeks right aside from follow up on you could select in simon you wanna show him like in a certain time right next to follow up on is the um right so you can select and then select a certain time frame so follow up in two weeks follow up in a month something like that if you see a patient and you do a consult and there's really nothing going on and you just want to follow up in six months follow up in a year you can do that too um okay okay alright so after that all you have to do is just click on save and accept and your follow up will be added on your provider note and uh the front desk staff they will be able to see you through alerts and recalls module other than that this is i believe for the patient instructions if anything uh you know you need to enter so this is just a plain text area so that's where you will be able to free type other than that anywhere on the provider note if you want to free type you will be able to do it you just have to place the cursor there and you will simply just start typing in and that information will be added now uh one drawback to that is that anything that you are not entering in these specific components will not carry forward so let's say if you just have added a test uh text somewhere uh you know between vitals and physical exam so this specific text will not carry forward in the next provider note okay so that's why we have all these components so everything is in these components and these components are associated in other provider note templates as well so information carry uh carry forward alright so that is about it after uh you are done creating the you are done with the provider note uh you simply just need to go ahead and you will sign it off and one more thing that i need to confirm from shawnee is ella going to be signing off on the notes on his own or he yes he will okay alright so you will simply just click on the sign button it's gonna ask you for the confirmation click okay you will have to click on patient decline and that's how a provider note will be signed off so whatever the information you have added so you will be able to see this on assigned provider note and at the bottom it's gonna have your electronic signatures for date and time stamp as well okay after that um if i ever like i'm reviewing a note to do billing and i see oh this doesn't have a good diagnosis or the procedure code and i'll ask you can you go back and fix up that note you can always go back to the note you can hit on unsign then you can make any changes and then you could sign it off again so if you need to unsign a note you can also unsign it okay uh so um shawnee our providers supposed to create the e super bills or not no i do that okay alright so this is uh this is the this is the last step that you have to do so you just have to sign off on the provider note at the bottom you will be able to see the electronic uh date and time stamp alright and it seems like a pretty straight forward system yep it is okay alright so um when you show him one more thing so if you click on the side you click on provider notes um so here you'll be able to see all the provider notes that the patient had until now um and then right under that we have the clinical letters simon if you could just show him quickly that patient care upon with their um so we're gonna be using this patient care fund so each time you know we see a patient and we established okay they're gonna need vain where there need arterial we're gonna create this care plan um you add in that template and you could put the date that they had their full venus ultra sound and then we'll start listing which veins need work will enter the procedure date when that vein was treated then when they got re scanned any notes you want to put in and then we'll move on to the next vein so if we see they're gonna need six veins they might fill in six veins here and then we could track when each one was completed and that way whoever the patient care coordinator whoever is managing the scheduling can check okay they they got the vein done but they still need five more days we're going to reschedule the next pain on this you know so this is the way of us tracking that all the veins that they that you know the physicians who needs to be completed are actually getting done and then the same thing with the arterial where we're going to select you know um what which are the reason things they need to be done okay okay got it and then you could also put any comments right there under under the box you could put any comments about what their patient care plan is um any description of you know there are issues and and what our plans for treatment is okay um and then you just can save that we're probably not gonna sign that off just because it's gonna be constantly being edited and updated as we go through the different people right got it okay um good so that is something you should be aware of anything else you could just show him where to find other things in the chart like by documents if we ever upload things into documents okay alright so for documents um so let's just say so this is the module that we have this is a document manager so you will simply just click on this cabinet icon it's gonna take you there and this is where you will simply just enter the patient's first or last name or the account number or at the bottom these are then again the patient's hot list like you know the most recently open patients charts get there from the patient um when your invitation um yeah you can do that too yes this is one workflow otherwise uh while you're in the patient's chart uh so you you simply can scroll down on the left hand side and this is where you have an option for documents and it's gonna take you there so these are two separate they'll upload you see where it says a bi reports they'll put in sometimes the reports um we do the abi the system generate a report and upload the report into the patient's chart here so when you're um when you're signing off the note you'll you'll indicate if with in order for us to build for the abi someone who's actually have to with the abi report so you'll note in the chart um maybe abi read as normal abi read a borderline abi read as abnormal whatever it is um so if you put a c p t codes for an abi then you also have to put some sort of note as to what came up on the abi report um and they'll upload the actual report here in the documents um so that we have a record of it um we might have other things here also like referrals or consents or things like that they might upload into this section so if you're ever looking for something and they say oh it's in the patient documents this is where you're gonna look okay um i think that's good so yeah so this is uh pretty much it about our uh training on front desk clinical in take and how to create the provider notes uh i mean if you need the details training on this document manager so shawnee has given you the brief overview that how this document manager is gonna work so this is where we have a full fledge training on document manager as well so you can simply just go ahead and you can uh run the document manager training and it will train you on this whole module in details on how you can uh you know create your own uh folders how you can upload files in the folder so so this is a step by step guide and it's gonna show you how this is all gonna work out okay okay so that is pretty much it so this is a recorded session so right after this meeting i will go ahead and i will share the meeting url with you for future reference um i mean you already have a test patient record in your system so i would recommend that you go ahead and uh you know create some sample templates sample provider notes and if you have any questions any concerns just uh hit me back uh i will share my email address and direct phone line with you um one more thing is to log support tickets whenever you have any issue whenever you know let's say if anything you're not able to access or maybe it's a permission issue or if you receive any error in the application so you can always log a support ticket so you simply have to click on support and then click on log a ticket and this window will open up this is where you can mention the subject uh let's say not uh you know able to access patient okay and if you if if if uh convenient you can mention a little bit of the description so it will give our support representatives an idea that what the issue might be before they give you a call you can select the module as anything uh you know normally you can just select it as settings then you select the type uh normally you can select it as other whatever the severity is if you want to get a call as soon as possible then you can select it as critical if it's just a minor issue or major so you can uh you know select the severity this is where your email will auto populate your phone number if this is the phone number that is uh you know in the application uh for the practices number but if you have a direct line or if you wanna give out your cell phone numbers you can mention that and you can mention that what is the best time to give you a call okay after you log a support ticket it directly goes to our uh team of support members if it's a billing issue it will go to the billing team if it's uh emr issue it will go to our ehr support team and so on and so forth so that is actually the quickest way to get your issue resolved because sometimes maybe you're trying to give me a call in a in a meeting i'm not able to assist you at that point so that's why we always uh encourage to log support tickets so you can get a quick resolution on your issues okay okay so that's about it uh if you have any questions just uh just let me know let shawnee know and you know she's very well trained on the application herself so she has done half of the training on this call she's uh getting pretty good at cure md or you know you can always reach out to us alright thank you so much simon thank you so much everyone for your time i really appreciate it take care have a good one bye alright bye bye

you put the card one more time do you want the same card can i use the insurance the same one okay yes okay it's in there is it full is it like the full card that's the back of it that's the back of it so it did detect the back that's the full back card but i do have an insurance card now if we want to use that because it's front and back let's try that do we need to do scan both sides i'll do i'll just make sure all the settings are good okay so that it doesn't change you don't have to change them again or we are going none the card is not going to so they must need there's gonna be a problem if they said call the card doesn't go through nobody answers i don't know if anybody told you or not but if you can try to get everybody use a debit card it's cheaper on us uh huh if they'll say to you you know just give them don't give them the option for credit unless they can't use it as a debit because that way if it's a debit it's only a few cents as opposed to a percentage because i think it's it's it's a debit it's only like 19 cents per transaction if it is a credit they charge a certain percentage of okay i believe we it's clear now and we are able to read the text clearly okay alright so let me look much better let's try give it one more try will it retain those settings i believe so alright the cards back in when you're ready that's not really need it but let's scan i think you only have to select you know the dual card thinking other than that i think it should take care the rest of the you know settings alright so let's start scan hang on one second do you need to be seen yeah you want to fill out one of those you don't need to be seen oh we're wasting stamps hang on let her she'll be here and take your bill i mean your payment in just a minute baby it didn't bring it through for some reason i may not have pushed it in far enough price let's try one more time maybe we can try the cards there for you okay he wants to make a payment how was your business was your visit good with urology uh oh sad the one i sent you for we will never do that again we won't ever do that again if you need it again you go to spring hill imaging and just pay cash radiology okay sherry are you are you there okay i think we we will have to select none here and scan both sides and i think that's it uh yes i believe so all the other settings i have selected all the other settings okay and uh let's try this you need any kind of testing done again you go to spring hill imaging yeah radiology is included in deal i can get a radiology read p a and lateral chest x rays for twenty nine dollar and you're done that looks better price but i just wanted to make sure that is what he was saying what you were talking to your patient uh huh yeah so he said leave it on none and that should help it alright none yeah instead of picking business card you know okay not business card okay just leave it on none and then we have to check for double right yes exactly there is just a little final touching is needed because it's just for you know cutting a little bit of margins so let me just fix that he might need it again hang on yes now i think it should be good yeah that looks much better please open it and just make sure now i can read it if i had to call them perfect so just leave it as like this and you should be good to go okay so none not business card color three hundered check scan both sides that's correct okay alright thank you all thank you okay sherry um just wanted to talk to you sure yes but do you have the ticket number for this um i believe you

nine numeric characters okay do you want me to just hold a moment do you mind if i take the control yeah sure please got it what's your practice name delta medical delta medical now uh i'm sorry i didn't catch your name first my name is james james uh james uh there is a setting that needs to be disabled for your practice because uh right now the ssn for the patient is being populated in there so just give me one minute i'm gonna update it so just bear with me i'm updating once it once it is disabled all your claims that has been rejected for this this reason that we have just seen it's gonna be fixed okay sure take your time and your practice name you told me delta medical right what you say dave uh the practice name is delta medical right yes this is the only rejection that we uh you wanted to fix actually uh no uh mr dave i tell you about miss baker uh i recently uh solve this issue for miss baker ronda and russi these are the four patients we're uh recently i resolve these rejections but again they pulled up so did you change the you know the policy number in these patients or not actually uh the policy number is same and it's true it's right right okay let's take a look i have forwarded your request to my clearing house team they're disabling uh settings from the back end this patient can you see there you entered patient group number okay uh let me see the patient group number group number and the policy number both are same no no no group number is different is he let me let me open up here yeah i see here these are the same uh but the but in the card it's different yeah definitely should be different let me open up the insurance there is a possibility at the time of the submission the group number was entered the same but later on you have changed it so i think so if if you figured it out that okay the group number is different so you just simply have to save it and resubmit it so can i save it to resubmit it yes just uh let me show you go here on the charge page because you know any changes that has been made in order to you know take those in the fact we just have to save the charge page and continue it's ready to be resubmitted how about what about this one okay one more uh thing mr dave uh can you see this patient may miss baker any one moment one moment i'm checking yeah can you please check this actually i wanted to uh add her insurance like uh you know in the software uh she having uh auto club i think uh can you please see uh the card of the patient let me one moment okay let me let me pull up the information name uh baker any let me let me first pull up the account sorry for that take your time and i will tell you about the patient let me see uh tell you sorry on the on the date of service patient uh having this one like cigna and can you open that up yes and patient give us the card of this okay and uh sorry uh sorry this one is a different this one is different uh actually yeah uh this one can you see this on this moment patient having this cigna hmo you know here uh it's showing error yeah my direct number just the policy number so let me check if y cigna h m o yes this is cigna i was already trying though do you have the insurance card there is no insurance right actually i um verify the eligibility of the patient uh in the in the portal uh like i called cigna and verify the eligibility of the patient on the date of january uh uh insurance uh said uh she's active uh january 1st to january 31st and uh and and here is not showing like they're giving some errors and i don't know what okay so if insurance is saying that this is the patient is eligible okay and you are submitting claims through curemd the rejection is coming from insurance you can ask them why the claim is still being rejected because for cure md there's one thing if we are showing you the eligibility response that is coming from the insurance record there is a possibility sometimes it happens i have seen it that some servers are out there have 34 or five or maybe 10 different servers or eligibility the server from we are from where we are fetching the information it might be outdated we're not getting the right information maybe there's some glitch or some error that is causing okay perfectly fine but if we are sending the claim and the claim is getting rejected so there's something definitely wrong with the insurance that why they are rejecting because in first place they are the one who actually told you that this patient is eligible and now they are rejecting the claim so in this case i think that you have to ask insurance company or or maybe there's another thing uh that can be the the the insurance the cigna insurance uh they might have uh an advantage or maybe a secondary plan or maybe the claim needs to be submitted to another payer id but uh by looking at it uh it doesn't seem that this is an issue you have to ask insurance company what's wrong here because you know if curemd is giving out an error and if insurance is saying so that doesn't make sense that why the claim is getting rejected then you can ask them that you know uh the claim is gonna be rejected but can you uh see uh claim history like claim files like maybe uh there is something something wrong alright well appreciate let me use it yes it clearly says that this patient does not exist in the database either either uh the policy number you can just double check and verify it if this is the right policy number can you check if this is the one 3286 yes so there is something wrong the this patient and this policy number does not exist in the racquet the response clearly says that so you you know in this case insurance is the one who can answer this rejection reason in this query who else was the patient for whome the rejection was uh not baker any baker yeah this is this one right yeah yeah for this one you have to call the insurance i'm asking about other than that uh and for uh and for mirroring use a use uh what you said for me for the uh the new policy was not same because previously the policy and group number was saying so that's why the claim was getting rejected now it has been re uh you know re save so you can resubmit it okay i will i will mark what what what's this error shh sure there is a $0 cpt code available here it should be 0.01 leave something like that but let me check double check i don't know this is the same rejection it's coming in for that ssn for the settings that i've sent request to uh my claim housing it will be fixed don't worry it's the same rejection can you hear me james yeah i can hear you okay and i just got a message for them it's fixed so this one and the other one that we discussed earlier the one that is coming up with this uh primary identifier nine numeric error you can resubmit those yeah how about how about that on this one which one modifier this is according our uh i cant help you sorry i can't help you with this coding because you know we do not have any professional coder here but this is something that you have to we don't know which modifier needs to go with this code so this is an according rejection so you have to either it's just to let you know it's a smart added smart added it is just a warning message if you're thinking that this is the right modifier and you want to still proceed with it you resubmit it it's a smart edit rejection okay no problem and the 3rd 1 2 different uh this is medicare claims yeah it's a medicare claim i know that it's and the medicare claim should always be submitted as an original someone has has submitted that name as a replacement so thats why rejection is coming in oh that's the reason yeah i know that you just have to save it and resubmit this one okay so you say the mark mark as corrected right yep yep okay i will mark it down and uh for andrew see mary you know uh i d like i placed right id okay this claim also goes to medicare actually it's a covered claim i got it yeah its a covid vaccine claim yes it should be submitted to medicare okay thank you mr dave for your help no worries man have a blessed day take care thank you bye bye how would you rate

in um with a little people icon that you showed me before and then you add in a different a different phone number in there um and that should send a separate link that's right and they should be good i am not in the office today however i tried to walk them through it and i believe they did it correctly um but i am going to do like a trial run one doctor alkati goes back to the hospital with his account because i can't get on anyone else's to try it out everybody's with patients right now um so i'll do you want me just to shoot you an email um if i'm having issues again because i just have a feeling maybe they entered incorrectly that's what i'm assuming as well because if they entered the patient link for another user the other patient might have kicked getting kicked out so they yeah so right link question actually too so say if we send that link over to somebody else and are they able to log in first or does the initial person need to be in and then the other ones can be logged the initial person and the provider needs to be logged into the session then the participants and the attendees can join the session okay so if the other ones try to join the sessions i mean i'm guessing they would just be sitting in a waiting room until the others join the session that's right okay so then i don't know maybe they entered the same phone number or something occurred there or maybe somebody sent like the email that they got from novel health i don't know but i am going to do a trial run when doctor goes to the hospital um and then i will let you know if i have any issues with getting kicked out because i'm assuming that's probably what happened probably so shall i keep this ticket open or should i go ahead and close it um if you're you you can close it if you're okay with

uh ok so for google chrome i'm able to access and log in the problem is now um fax's okay hold on 1 second okay faxes hold on 1 second okay josh alright so i was looking at um to try and do it for my old um internet area uh first issue we had a problem with so normally for faxes i would go to the fax box um go to this pc go to fax is and it would be like fouth icon that i'll be able to open it up from when i go on google chrome and go to access it there i don't have anything showing up and for some reason it's also showing up as it's invalid invalid user name and password even though i signed out of the curemd one did you x out or did you sign out log out no i uh i logged out of the google chrome one and now it's showing me invalid user name and password huh uh do you have the correct cloud cloud four mm curemd dot dot com at the top of the l is for cloud dot com right i have here cloud 11 i don't know why it should be cloud 4 oh it keeps showing me cloud 11 mm just to uh erase everything from the url put in cloud 4 just type it in cloud 4 you should see a link to it at the bottom for cloud 4 so type in cloud 4 you see the link at the bottom just to you know use that one for yes i'm signed in now let's go to the faxes area um give me one second it has this pc desktop and documents i normally go to this pc but i don't have any of my fax is showing fax is showing um alright just open up at anydesk again okay hold on hold on 1 second okay josh okay josh okay you're still here with me correct why anydesk currently is deciding not to open for me okay code is 190 817 602 should have accept hit accept alright uh could you show me chrome what do you mean uh let's see okay pages unresponsive oh god oh yeah so this is is happening right now and we are like so behind it's not even funny okay could do you have the option to access task manager on your search bar just go there and uh do you have the option to search for task manager under search under here mhm just just just go for task manager and uh and end task for google chrome end mhm okay now what uh alright you're clear on that i'll probably have to close out anydesk is not responding on my end too so let me do that first okay i'll send your request again am i closing everything now uh no i'm just gonna send you back a request on anydesk just accept that one alright i see it now so google chrome mhm yeah working out we have to sign in again and this link is let's see this 11 okay let me change that first okay normally for faxes we go to this button here mhm on this side will pop up this pc it'll it'll pop up actually like a bunch of other things normally it's this pc that we click on and then when it's on the old one here it would normally say this pc and then go to it would have the option of faxes um it does not have that option and then we will go to the icon that i have here once after we get faxes all of them will pop up and we can choose it from here and they'll pop up here and then we're able to just fix them and put them into the patient charts or print whatever that we need which drive is it let's see so it's not the c drive it's another drive i guess you have it on where do you have the fax folder isn't another drive like the fax drive is that the one you have it on location because uh if you remember like the name like where you go into um hold on this is that it should have all the messages in it i guess i just changed the view uh let's say you changed it so i can change it back to the list i guess i don't know what it was on before uh this is the one that was on but yeah it was a fax that you actually had i think i think this is the one you guys had and you want that back uh let's see if it shows up here can you log in from here what do you want me to log in from where from the first screen oh gosh let's see if that works okay so normally we go to the fax machine over here and we go to this pc we double click i don't know if i did that or if that was me or you and then it'll go to fax which is down here drives and we'll be able to see them here this way but we normally click the fourth one which is right here and they pop up um in like for example all in one line and we're able to normally see them and then we're able to just put them in the patient's holders chrome i guess yeah you need like special permissions on chrome in order to see the drive i guess they were already set up for you on internet explorer okay so you have uh okay you're not seeing it since these are network drives the faxes on instead of standard drives on your computer so shared drives okay so it's probably not gonna work we had that again the issue was checking the major if you want i e other than that everything was working so let's see okay i e uh we just needed to get back up and running because this is like haywire for us right now we uh behind us and even funny and i was also told you had an issue with ekg them not sure if they can actually that was my other partner yeah she said she had an issue with ekgs and she still has the same issue i guess uh what i would suggest for right now is you use the app and you use the daily view instead of multiple that would actually get you you know the option to check in on internet explorer so you can check in you know right from this screen instead of going to multiple and for you can just toggle between if you wanted to go to lena's but yeah if you're only looking for our scheduled at the moment right you can adjust the dates from here as well uh i don't know exactly what they want they usually want either lena or doctor lion because in this case which one okay you have the resources one here that has gone you and multiple okay because uh i can actually fix the issue right now so yeah it would either be you have to go into resource lena and then take care of that or provider lion and check in through here what about the faxes how am i going to do that is not working curemd is working is just the network needs to be properly installed in our team would have to work with you in order to actually get those drives uh to be viewable on chrome as well because in the transport i believe is already set up for that so uh that would be another process entirely i would suggest not use chrome if you're gonna be using the network as well you can continue the app but the only thing would be the multiple view is currently not working which i'm gonna report but uh yeah just for me to print and put faxes in patients charts whatever it is that we need to print from the doctor all that you can do on the app but you just don't have to use the multiple view on the app that's the only difference um so let me see if we can open it like this and see what happens open like that why is nothing showing up okay hold on why is it not okay why is it not switching to the 4th 1 normally it works uh which 4th 1 i am sorry i'm trying to click on remember we click it here and all of them pop up um like in a row and it's not doing it why i don't know the view gets stuff into lines like uh line doesn't like um i'm sorry uh let's see okay probably have to log out once okay try logging in again try going back into documents so if you can get the view fax no it's not working the only other way is maybe doing it this way but nothing is working except for only this way and i don't know if there's more than this or not okay let's try this josh what are we doing that's when installed uh okay uh let's try this again uh the only difference was that i install the client utility for from uh let me just once we started let's see if that works okay try now nope so the only way basically to look at faxes and to do with them is this way is that correct sort of looking like you're saying you used to change like what does it convert into was away so for example we were quick faxes and instead of it being the way it is now we would normally go to this option and it would go straight down like for example there's 4 8 12 of these it'll go down in a row 12 so that's not what it looks like right now okay okay the list let's see i'm having some of i t take a look at it so they can let me know what exactly the list isn't working okay do you understand what i basically just do this as of right now you can't do that but i'm just asking them to confirm just to give me a minute or two they should have an answer for me but uh other than that you do get okay you do get that the scheduler uh the way i'm telling you to use it you do get it yes you're staying to work from daily so as long as you can work for daily for today we'll have a report it and get back to you tomorrow on why isn't sorting and this view that's not okay um just i'll just have someone from i t take over for this uh it's not working on alright i'm having someone from i t take a look at the computer okay so do i have to stay on the phone because like i already have i'm way behind just give me like two minutes you should oh no it's for for me alright could you log in okay what's going on why is it not just try again it should be the correct one okay try again okay i don't know what's going on i need you to figure it out because the main thing i don't care about the check in right now i'll do it from daily i just need the faxes to be up so i can be able to send patients into the chart and upload it for the doctor so that she's able to see everything for today okay because we we're gonna keep getting faxes constantly can you call me back and give me an update well we'll have to be on your computer to computer specific thing on our end it's working fine that that's the only issue okay give me one moment josh yep i think it should be good now i'm just gonna have you log in if it's not already locked in let me just check i don't think it's logging in just to log in once it should be good hold on someone working um hold on there is an issue but since this morning were you able to do it this morning i didn't look at the faxes because normally i do and i noticed uh just the check in process which wasn't working and then i realized after check in process the copay wasn't working to add a copay and then now i just realized this and this morning the other co uh the medical assistant tony her ekg things are not working either so i have no idea what's going on okay that does seem to be a problem a bunch of problems i'm gonna have to report it but uh i can't have anything fixed at the moment right now faxes and report them and send them and print and is this the only thing you yeah you can see the test with you hold on sorry okay let me just see it this way and see what happens let me just say something where did it go for part one or 2 no that was that it usually shows up as a today's date hold on it is still here why is it not popping up okay it's not popping up let me see something else let me see if i can print this if this i can print and that's fine because these are just easy and i get this to the doctor but as per the actual fax that needs to go into the chart that's a big no no no i'm not going there okay drag and drop test bothering me so much okay dragging and dropping burning give me one moment okay josh yup okay so what's going on okay i don't see the dragon drop option working either let me just report it to our manager i'll get back to you okay okay so what would you like for me to do at the moment i tend to work through the appointments and that's more important than the fax is i don't care about i can do the check in on daily if you want to schedule appointments on daily on my end the more important thing is faxes the fax is you would have to manually upload them right now i know it's time consuming but let me just talk to my manager and get back to you okay okay give me a call back alright bye alright josh bye"}}, {"id": 759, "data": {"call_id": "1623071381.133462.txt", "text": "hello hi anna this is harry

yesterday with scheduling so i wanted to know if the situation got corrected because i still can't schedule patients i have patients to see yesterday i don't know what to do and i and i told you about the problem and i was gonna try to schedule them tonight but i still can't schedule alright uh could you please confirm me if you have a support ticket log for that a four digit work uh do you have a support ticket log for this uh issue that you're facing i'm not sure i don't think so they didn't give me that sure you're calling from mind and body and may i please have your name once again rosey rosey james alright rosey could i put you on a brief hold and confirm this issue at my end yeah i'll be right back thank you so very much for holding on the line i have reconfirmed this on my end um at and there's no issue in the scheduler could you please confirm me when you try to schedule an appointment does it pop up any error message or does it slow what exactly is the issue yes it says that i don't have a calendar associated that's the problem alright in order to me like it says it shows no calendar for today alright uh in that case we would have to make a new scheduler for that day would it be conveniently possible for you to do a remote session so that we can make the scheduler for you yes but what time can we do that to um because i'm gonna have this can we do the session tonight like about six o'clock sure we can do that once you're free give us a call so that we can help you with that sure no problem once you're available please give so that we can get the details from you and make the schedule for yourself alright i wanted to go huh i just had a question now if i wanted to go do it myself right this is what i normally do like for today is the 18th i would go to add an update the calendar and i would see 50 i would see a bunch of calendars when i click on my calendar i see a bunch of dates mhm you know and then when you go to the template let me i'm trying to understand how to do it myself sure once you hit add an update calendar you need to uh press the add icon that's on the right hand side of the search once you click add it will prompt you to give a name to your scheduler select the location date start time and time duration of each appointment and the days you want that scheduler for once you're done entering the information you will hit save and the scheduler would be open for that particular days uh and that time okay alright i'm gonna try to do that and um and um i'm gonna try to do it right now sure give me one minute sure let me do it right now sure no problem i go there okay it's hard to do it on my phone because i remember trying to do that yesterday like even if you look at um my today's calendar it says there's 92 slots available mhm between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. but when you click on the slots it tells you you can't schedule them because there's no calendar i totally understand that it would be you know easier for us if we can do a remote session on any desk so that i can show you the workflow otherwise if you're busy right now and you want to you know call back again in your convenient time you can do that and we would be more than happy to assist you uh to show you the workflow how to add a calendar and if there's any issue we will take care of it okay will i also be able to um uh delete the previous calendars that i made because i had because when i was doing that ad update thing like you said it created a whole bunch of calendar so i don't know what's what's going where alright if there's a scheduler on which you have not booked any appointment that can definitely be deleted however if there's a schedule on which you have schedule an appointment it might get deleted or it might not be deleted for the what you can do is you can you know put an ended for today's date and that scheduler would be over and starting from you know tomorrow on what you can make a new schedule as per your requirement uh that's the reason why i was requesting you to do a remote session so that we can you know do that together and i can show you the workflow how to add a calendar and how to make notifications in that okay okay alright alright alright alright alright so i'll i'll call back tonight sure whenever you have 6 o'clock sure no problem have a good day bye do i can i ask can i ask for you or is it gonna be anybody uh anybody who would you know take up your call will be more than happy to assist you otherwise my name is collin howard uh anybody can assist you no worries at all okay

mm mm okay okay it's 280305 049 alright i'm sending you a request my name is colin howard just to make sure that you're getting the request from me thank you for accepting the request i am about to see your screen bingo i don't want you can now let's see can i take over for just a second i'll show you i'll show you what's going on okay so um here for example i am trying to do let me show you first what i initially the problem that i initially had so i clicked on the patient here and here on the left side registration clinical and billing so billing i don't need to access i need to access i mean i do want to have it there but i need to access the status on on appointment and i don't have access to any of that anymore and you do not have the access to provider notes even no nothing i don't know why alright uh can you please confirm me your role in the office mm for an office no i just need to confirm scheduling appointment uh surgery booking are you a medical assistant are you a nurse are you a physician no no no no receptionist alright uh alright so what i i would like to inform you is that your user role that is your login and password does not have all these permissions from the user role settings so the office manager would be able to you know either authenticate this changes so that i can give you the required permissions or they can do that on their own give me 1 second no problem hello colin yes i'm right here okay sorry about that no problem so i don't know what you mean i've always had access to it i totally understand that but for now when i looked at your profile you do not have access to scheduling you do not have access to provider note um i mean so the you know who made that change i'm afraid it will not be possible for me to confirm that however uh either any of the physicians or the office manager arthur jones either they can give me the consent to go ahead and give you the required permissions or they can do that on their own would it be conveniently possible for you to give i mean uh call arthur on the phone so that i can take the consent and give you the required permissions thank you uh i just want to understand what happened because i need these tools definitely yes i totally understand that uh because of these are the two major things that you would be needing in order to you know carry on with the patient care but but for the workflow or the standard operating procedure that we have if a user does not have any permissions and we need to give the required permission the consent of the office manager is required so if you can please just call him on the phone for a minute i'll just take the consent and i will give you the required permissions i want him to contact you or is he available in the practice right now no he's part of you guys arthur jones yes give me one moment is herman available herman yeah but he's with a new employee lesley uh she's not here right now is herman available uh he is but he's been literally this is like his fifth day so i don't know how he can help you actually his profile has the ability to give you the permission so if he can log in from his profile okay so what i'm saying is that there's been a mistake because i have been using this system for three years more than three years herman has been here literally five days so how does he have access to all and i'm pretty much handling doctor's surgery scheduling and most of his work and now i don't have access so you guys made a mistake somehow can i put you on a brief hold and confirm this online please give me one moment i'll be right back i don't know what they did at cure m d but i don't have access to like appointments and a lot of stuff and they're saying that they need to talk to you that way i can get the clearence and so i'm like mondays tuesdays at four yeah four and then fridays at 11 but that one is super busy so going through that oh okay okay oh okay okay okay yeah and thank you so very much for holding on the line um instead of keeping you on hold for this long uh can you allow me to just investigate this whole scenario on my end and give you a call back in another 10 15 minutes let me just see what yeah because that that looks you know uh that's making sense to me a new user who has just you know joined the practice has the access and you you've been working for the last three years and all of a sudden your access has gone so let me just troubleshoot this on my end and i will give you a call back in some time alright thank you problem thank you so very much"}}, {"id": 765, "data":

me just open it on my end uh so the 5 17 note uh they're exactly the problem is we open 5 17 note let me do that on my end let me see quickly here supposedly 5 17 note let's go a bit down exactly is uh where you see the echoes in the diagnosis mm it's not a diagnosis it's like uh let me see well you get the vital signs um let me see here i guess it i guess it's this one this part here i mean it shows now maybe yeah because that's what i uh thought in the procedure section in the diagnosis section um it is there they say according to the uh log in you know it's it's not you know showing up like you know all the let me let me look at the let me look at the echo the echo results are not showing up so i guess let's see this one let's see diagnosis under dramatic this one show now hold on i think it's this one non rheumatic my travel ball registration n o s 134 diagnosis echo 6 27 to 24 6 let me see if that shows up now because it looks like in my end is showing up now right so that's what i figured on my end that it was showing up so i just wanted to confirm uh where exactly that it was not showing up let me see here uh 6 27 to okay it shows up now because like because maybe uh on friday when or thursday it's not here that's why right maybe there was some sort of for a few seconds maybe that could be the issue of civilian because when i was looking at it like yeah i remember when doctor auroraor showed me it still was not there you know maybe take a day to upload it and things like that i'm not sure so straight away but maybe it was some sort of from the back end or some issue but uh yeah that could be the reason otherwise it shows it doesn't take that much time yeah it shows it already shows like the um what's it called like the the result right here and it's all here you know um the echo 6 27 17 11 20 so yeah you may be close this one now um alright so in case it happens again just let us know and we'll look into it okay okay and then i'll take a snapshot

were teaching me how to upload documents and attach it to the uh what do you call it new patient provider note and so when i was trying to do that it was giving me these things tell me i needed to do this and do that and so anyway i may have accidentally deleted i don't know what is needed on here i don't know if that's what it is but after that it's not allowing me to scan like insecure and b so if i go and try to scan into any of these folders uh like i can scan using my scanner i can scan to my computer and save it but when i actually try to go into here and do it it won't allow me it gives me a c really now it says that hold on hold on can i check something real quick sure now it's working so i don't know what is going on with curemd it was not working earlier uh okay i will check that for you okay uh let me take a look i guess that wasn't an issue because it fixed itself no usually what happens is let me tell you uh sometimes the drivers or the vendors is is updating and it's in the process and while you're doing that uh it's kind of like you know interfere with other thank drivers of the you know attached devices scanners or printers so that might be cause uh can you show me what was the printer problem oh yeah the printer so when i go into let's see so i've been printing these off every all morning with different patients when i go on the provider note and that new patient letter and i'll go ahead and click print and then when it comes up here to the next screen and i try to print it talking about right here pdf and it wasn't doing that earlier but it it just started doing it let me check i've tried restarting my uh cutting off my printer i've tried logging out of curemd and it just keeps doing it okay i'm going to close everything i want to make sure uh

at the bottom i'm sorry like there's a little like like a pdf files like on the left it says anydesk click on that click on one of those okay you need to double click on that file opening anydesk so we'll see okay hold on i think it's working now okay i have a number for you yes please 523531 and connect 523531503 okay i'm sending you the request just click on connect accept you will see a prompt message a pop up and you need to accept yes allow access and accept did you accept it i did uh unfortunately it's not loading on my side let me let me send the request again i'm sending you the request again so what do i do exit out of everything that i have no no no you'll you'll see the request you'll see a message uh well i guess you're not receiving the request as of right now uh but i can't let me exit out and start it over but let me try that i can i can actually tell you the steps verbally okay so let me try this again uh it's the same as 523531503 and i click to connect you don't need to click on connect you just need to open that screen and you don't need to do anything i'll send you the request okay there's nothing to open up uh you you just see the number right do not click connect i will click connect on my end okay alright sorry about that no problem do you have access uh i'm sorry do you have access to the screen yet uh no um the message is not going through i'm sending the request to just keep on you know loading and not coming up anything but if you can open the practice go into any patients account i will guide you the steps okay okay i am in a person's account now click on billing and then click on quick charge okay now on the quick charge like you will fill out every single thing as normal but there there are two uh there are two locations on the charge page where you put in the date of services correct one is one is at the top you know top half of the charge page and one is at the c p t level correct hold on everything went away okay yes there's one at the top start date of service and end date of service okay then down lower lower where you put procedure codes yes yes now there are two things on the top portion where it says start the u s and the end the u s you need to mention the complete range now let's say you have checked in a patient multi you check the patient multiple times in the month of may so you can mention the first of may until the 30th of may 31st of may that's the range and at the bottom in the bottom then you will use the same procedure code in front of the procedure code to start the d o s and the end of the d o s should be correct and can be different and can be multiple makes sense no where you put the procedure in yes like you're saying that you have uh build a procedure uh like you have performed the procedure on a patient multiple times right right right okay so on the top mentioned the date range from which date the appointment begin and then when was the last appointment date that that will be a range okay okay so let's say you would only do that is if it was like one person with one or 2 procedure codes that were all the same throughout like four or 5 times yes and multiple data services but on top you will mention the range that from this date to this date the patient had multiple appointments uh which you will mention on cpd level on top you will just mention the range okay so at the bottom you will have to add the procedure code like multiple times how many appointments did this patient had like five or 6 point so if let's consider let's consider the patient had five appointments you need to mention the cpt code five times and mention the correct date of service on every single procedure code oh okay okay so in that way the insurance will know that this is the range in between which the patient was had an appointment multiple times and at the bottom they will know which procedure was performed on which date of service and it's not and it's not only limited to a common procedure code you can have multiple procedure codes okay like on one day to the patient has just at an office visit on another visit there was some different procedures so you can all mention it okay okay okay i got that okay and if i think if you have any questions related to this you can resubmit the claim if you have any questions if anything comes up uh you can always reach me back at my extension my extension is 537 hold on 1 second here five three 75 37 my name is phil okay alright thank you so much i appreciate that no problem if i'm if i'm not available do leave me a

i'm good ah natalie i hope you're doing well thank you so much for that i just wanted to discuss regarding uh the email that you sent over for dr brandi chase you know getting enrolled have you received the response from eric ward yeah that was just for united health care okay so what does that answer multi plan or anything else okay so um um usually all the providers and you know they have access and they have the uh you know if they are in network with any specific insurance um they can perform the telehealth but uh and have you i mean usually we do not have any restrictions from insurance all we have is the all we need to bill out the specific protocols for telehealth which are the modifier and the patient services uh what else actually you're looking for you mentioned that doctor is not in the list of approved providers for telehealth yes uh we've had to turn away patients because they don't have brandy as a telehealth provider so what happens is usually when patients have like their second visit it goes it falls under the telehealth appointments so then what happens is if that occurs then some of her codes will not be covered some of the by the insurance the telehealth codes will not be covered can you open up your computer yeah yeah it's right in front of me okay let's see okay so for some reason i thought like if you go to account 5692 i thought there was a problem list on here for this patient but i don't see it anymore but if i recall correctly um an appointment was on the problem list because it was not covered under telehealth okay let me let me see that uh if there was a problem list let me well um there isn't any any in the results bucket as well uh are you sure this was the right account i'm sure it's the right account just a moment because he's paid the $50 copay per visit um okay region telehealth uh march so he's paid for two appointment for february 4th and march 3rd and that's still in his unapplied and i swore this was a patient that was on the problem list but of for some reason i'm not seeing it anymore okay so um if i if i uhh this example for the data service march 19 2021 it will visit and has been paid by cigna uh you see if if you see be there will be a modifier nine use for telemedicines the rest of the amount the rest of those data services are still as charged i mean um so what about february 4th uh february four let me pull up the you'll be for that this wasn't the uh telemedicine visit bills at leave it at the codes for telemedicine the only difference breaking that"}}, {"id": 780, "data":

other systems as well make sure that these okay let me just tell you step by step there could be two problems if you it's giving you the error that download the installer it means that the utility is not running so make sure to double click on that so if when it runs you see the sea icon at the bottom then you'll be able to open a chemo manager but the next thing is the the second thing is if it's if you're continuously clicking on it and it's going away that it's not getting stable so you need to copy the host file into the host but if the host file is already into the system you need to delete that and then copy the new one and then you should need to launch this utility and then you'll be able to open the chemo manager okay thank you so much rickyou're welcome take care bye bye

okay thank you thank you for holding priscilla there alright so actually it is not letting here uh you know make any changes or at any copay because there was no insurance selected over here in primary secondary or tertiary patient does not have any insurance so it is self paid right so i mean the copay uh is for the you know if if only you have the insurance only then the copay can be documented so for the other uh so this this this amount that the patient paid that was not a copay so that was an advance or something um well i mean we like charge it as like a copay like that is the price for their um like the appointment like their office visit and you are documented as a copay yes that is that is normally what we do patient does not have this patient does not have an insurance right and and the amount this patient is paying you wanna document that right okay just give me a minute let me see who in the billing department can help you in this matter just bear with me okay thank you thank you for holding are you there priscilla are you there yes i am here alright so because you are in this patient does not have an extra insurance and you could there are two options

advances um yeah that is fine okay go ahead okay i just wanted you to make sure that is the patient right yes that is the patient okay i do not think it is saved hello yes uh uh like all the

noble health to do one of my telemedicine appointments and for some reason it wasnt working and we ended the session now its not letting me restart a new session for that patient shes waiting alright uh give me one quick moment let me get you connected to somebody from the relevant department and they might be able to help you out give me one quick moment please sure do anything maybe because it thinks you already finished the session i would just do another one but i dont know if thats gonna affect the check in time or place or like payment yeah it might because i might have to it should be able to easily allow you to open it back yeah theres got to just be a way that were not seeing like usually when you make the appointment thats perfect hm whats that im confirming the availability of someone from the noble health team just bear with me a few moments please sure there has to be a way to like open up this happens often like if you have a technology issue and you just cant get to see the patient because of like blurry connection or just unavailability we should be able to easily reopen it i mean you could just do the appointment over the phone if they dont figure it out you know its sketchy though like to bill you cant like just bill an insurance over the phone oh you have to see what it is and youre supposed to say that you saw them you could but its not a good form when our phones werent working the other day he was gonna do it on your cell phone dont forget to change this to apply for you oh yeah i dont know that did you do this like when she when she came back here always do it like when the patient comes back here it should be done on the front end on the check in interesting what apply the payment to check out no check in because you accept payment on the check in yeah once youve accepted it oh you mean you mean when the patient physically checks out i dont know is that how youre supposed to do it yeah uh alright doctor pirzada im going to transfer your call to evan hughes who will be able to assist you with your issue alright thank you youre welcome from a from a before they walk out yeah right paid up so im just like okay bye but now i should have asked her if she wanted thank you for calling cure md this is evan how can i help you hey evan doctor pirzada here how are you doing im good doctor how are you so evan we had some like technical difficulty with one of my 4 30 patients geraldine and she basically um couldnt be seen like i couldnt hear her and the picture was all sketchy so i shut the appointment but i didnt realize that once i shut the appointment i cant go back in the appointment and were basically trying to understand how can we see this patient who needs to be seen right now shes had a 4 30 appointment its five o clock were half an hour late for this appointment alright doctor is that okay if i can connect with your screen yeah go for it uh do you have the any desk application installed doctor yeah let me give you the number 413 246 mhm 237 okay so um did you end the session doctor you know what i think i did i think i may have by mistake ended it yeah i think thats what happened thats what my friend desk receptionist was telling me too that i think you ended it i dont know how we ended so im just going to take controls doctor alright so this was the patient yeah this is her novel health right right so doctor unfortunately if once you end the uh session uh you would not be able to get back into the session you can always close it but you mistakenly pressed uh end the meeting so theres nothing you can do but you can uh schedule another appointment and they can get the session uh in white and they can get on to the new session if you want what about the money that have been collected for her and all that uh thats already done uh remove the payments to reschedule the appointment we already collected the money we collect the money on the front end right when they come to the front front side okay so this is her right so like i mean you can see on the check in like we collected the 199 is it no shes five dollar co-pay did you already collect it yeah okay and you already applied it no to apply this on the check out is youre saying so evan can you advise what we should do at this point um so the money has been taken now doctor yeah the the copay has been taken okay so um what i can advise at this stage is doctor because uh the provider note and super bill has already been created for this account um uh would you be able to uh give the patient a phone call yeah i think thats what im gonna have to do okay i know now now i know now you taught me that basically cant shut the note right okay so doctor alright evan so theres no way to go theres no way to go back once that happens what if theres a technical issue like this one where we couldnt hear the patient what are you supposed to do at that point uh you can just close the session doctor and go in to the session again but once you end the session uh that way you cannot go back in okay makes sense i appreciate your time no worries doctor anytime and if theres any issue just give us a call back doctor thanks bud alrighty

print it doesn't print now this happened to me last monday and tuesday but then we had issues with our router cable vision had to come and they worked on that and they couldn't print because as you know 13 girls in the front here there's all kinds of computers so i came in this morning and i and i can't print it and then so what i did is i went to i went there where you are okay um see it's not even printing the test page as well i'm sorry you see you see this is over here at the above it says it's offline yes how do i this is coming up as offline so let me just see if i can be able to help you with this one because outside the CureMD this won't be printing as well so let me just see and just so you know rick i went into the control panel and went to devices and printers on the right side there i tried that you tried to print it as yes and my boss tried to do it it shows it's working there it is okay so it's the third one with the check mark c h p 2430 oh it's that one we tried everything we went to properties i went to oh you want to remove the device i did that too on monday and it still didn't work yeah let's see okay you are the guy youre the main man let's see if i'm able to help you with this one there as well you gotta help me because i got to print i'm sure you can i think it's just some flukey thing because actually yeah one thing that is for sure this is actually not a CureMD issue because the printer is coming going off line so there must be a problem with the connectivity of the computer of the computer and the printer between each other so let me just see if we can do something uh what's the name of the printer did you find hp laser jet 2430 2430 yes and then i tried adding it okay i did all that stuff do you can you find your printer over here no it's not it's not exactly it's uh it's not here anymore because we deleted it now we have to search for it right exactly can you see if the printer's switched on or off its on oh no its on and its ready and theres two other people in this office and they are able to print they're able to print exactly there is a connection problem with your printer yes there is a connection problem with your printer and your computer so you gonna need some IT external IT guy to protect the router as well because the connection with this computer and the printer is not established so that is why i'm also not able to search it as well when i have removed it i'm also not able to see the printer because it's not getting connected with this computer so there is a connection problem we can't upload the printer information um no because it says queue the device so it is not finding what you're looking for so it will take you to this page i dont know what to do yeah because this is something exactly so you have to get an external IT for this one to get this uh printers connected with this computer what if i we shut the printer off on wednesday you know shut it down and then turn it back on should i unplug let's do that let's see let's see if we yes do that can i put you on speaker yes sure thank you okay you there yes i'm there okay great thank you so i'm gonna go in the back okay mhm so there's okay so i should unplug the i'll unplug the power cord and the gray thing that connects to the printer yes okay okay i unplugged that should i plug it back in again it's very hard to see it okay i'm plugging it back in and i'm gonna unplug the power cord right and then i'm plugging that back in okay so now it's trying to boot up so let's just now should we try to print just give me a moment first we need to so it's still uh it's it's it's resetting the hp printer yes reset it do let me know whenever it says ready okay not ready yet almost ready okay now it says ready but we have to get that print that printer on the screen right yeah let me just try to see if he can able to search it maybe now and what's this one that got checked off that's not ours that's not the printer you see the green arrow yeah no we are still not able to locate your printer so can i put the name of the printer down or okay so should i type in what it is hp 2430 i don't believe it won't work because it will ask the computer name and that so i believe you must need to get an external IT for this because they the who any any external IT person if you have an IT person in your practice you can get them but if you don't have a need to call someone from the outside to get it checked because there is a connection problem with the printer and this computer okay so because it wasn't listed yes can i just try to make sure if you can let me select the shared printer by name okay hp let's just try maybe hp it's hp laser jet 2430 okay 2430 okay you need to special specify a valid network printer name because exactly that's not gonna work i believe oh wait oh something open about all these things and these are all the computers networke computers yeah see it doesn't show so how do we know what one of these seven aren't one of the they should need to be the one that is one but that's not the one which you are looking for so i i would rather recommend you to get someone from the outside so that they can get it fixed okay okay i appreciate your help thank you youre welcome im gonna just get out then right yeah you can just close yes youll sign off i'll just sign off okay thank you"}}, {"id": 803, "data": {"call_id": "1620411563.77445.txt", "text": "thank you for calling curemd this is bryce hi uh my my name is steve calling from l k uh we have uh orders and results

how may i help you good morning sara this is harry sanders from CureMD can i speak with elaine yeah absolutely one second thank you my pleasure hi how are you i'm very good elaine how about yourself very well thank you i received a ticket are you calling about my ticket that is correct about the preferences on the calendar yes anyway you can show me that on the screen share session sure i'm ready to what do i use anydesk that's right okay okay 620 911389 so if i have sent you the request and i can see your desk now okay let's see okay so when you the scheduler see these numbers down here in the past these numbers would tell us the number on the calendar and no it's okay this number and the parentheses shows the number of available appointments if you hover over it it will show you let me just check if you just hover over it it will show you available appointment slots 52 checked in our 46 and the available slots are 31 okay so wait a minute so if this box is available fifty-two why does it say 31 available on an empty scheduler the available appointments are 52 out of which you have selected a few slots for the appointments and the remaining appointments are 31 okay so this doesn't give you the number scheduled it gives you the number available that is correct let's see if we can find an empty date where there are no appointment scheduled let's try can you just direct me to any day where there are no yep go into that green box so let's say hover over three yes so frankly so why would they say one then oh that's a very good question let me check okay because see there's one booked see we were always told that this was the number of patients scheduled i can sense that now so you are now saying that it's giving a wrong information about the appointments yes see here this july 2nd there's one scheduled and it's saying that there's one um so here on the 28th 123412 we have five scheduled you are correct three 45 and it's showing five so and here so 21 would be 21 scheduled go for some weird reason see schedule 21 scheduled 21 if you hover over and forcefully booked one one yeah joanna shields is forcefully booked so here is 11 and says 11 in parentheses and 11 are scheduled but if you go to may it's kind of weird um this one if you hover check in 46 and here is only 31 let's go to wednesday scheduled is 42 and it only says 40 15 and assistant so do you think this 23:40 and 31 are incorrect yes let's try so it's 24th for current factor let's try insurance is carol factor for 24th so the number was 31 let's check correct see and the number there is 46 checked in 46 checked in 16 scheduled let me just take us recording the screen okay sure 321 okay now let's go back on that date 5/24 so i have the video let me see what the development says about this are you facing any discrepancy on any other date um no it it really changes once the the um appointments are billed so um yeah so this wouldn't this wouldn't go inside because charge and paid the 63 but let me see this is 45 i guess once we can count i don't know what so 40 52 that's not gonna work if they're already billed out it only works for uh the dates not billed let's see so here we got 23 in june and we have 26 scheduled so that's incorrect do we have 19 and 20 scheduled thats weird so it's only hang on this calendar correct yeah no problem let me escalate this with our development team and see what they say about this okay okay sounds good thank you so much alrighty thank you harry have a good day you as well bye bye thanks okay bye"}}, {"id": 807, "data": {"call_id":

one moment i'm just trying to work on this one give me one moment okay uh thank you so much for staying on the line annie can you hear me okay annie i've just confirmed it actually referring you to call change healthcare at this moment and on this specific patient it was rejected due to the procedure code and what i get from here since i'm not authorized coder but um what i've actually search online so it was actually regarding the procedure code which is actually what i think is is relevant to the icds which being used on the claim but how you get out you have the same number the same number on the previous patient as well but you have the issue with the uh sorry the diagnosis code icd code so you can actually call let me show you the same number is given over there as well you need to call on this number three and you have the trace number right here so you can give the trace number of the claim on the call and you can ask them what information they need all the claims so you can submit them you can even ask them why it's being rejected you the procedure code if it's not irrelevant if it's uh the irrelevant code so you will be changing it if it's a relevant code they will let you know what information needs to be being sent out to the insurance okay this is the one e p c the one you're talking about about the this one i'm sorry is it the number that i have to call 844 that's the phone number it's right here e p c r e p c r m d then j zero f six c j 69 and you will see the same number and sorry not the same number but you will find the trace number for the other claim on the on the spot as well you will find the other number as well so you can go to the same patient and you can have the trace number call on the number on the option three and you can actually ask them to resolve this problem you just you need to actually make sure if you're using the right cpt against the right icd codes so you can adjudicate this claim okay i get it okay one more question before you leave me who i was trying to end an insurance and came up an errors i'll show you this one okay georgia so i was trying to put the uh insurance but um you know uh why is it coming up as error because this is the right number for this uh insurance so why is it coming up error the eligibility issue did you log a ticket regarding this concern um no no okay let me see see eligible request rejected patient date of birth doesn't match that for patient or the database please correct and resubmit please make sure you have the wise information added on the demographics page and then you can run this eligibility because for now it actually shows you the message in front of you that's why it's not allowing you to check anything where it's not running it's the it's just the um where you say it's an extra um feature that we actually provide you the practices so they can actually be connected with the service directly now it's not getting this information from curemd it actually gets the information from the insurance service maybe you're using the right date of birth maybe you're using the right details but right now there's only one way that you can actually make sure you can ask the patient or you can ask the patient to contact the insurance to confirm the patient date of birth and uh the patient on the database now it's it's very simple it says patient doesn't match that for the patient or on the database that means maybe the patient date of birth is different than the insurances records but it's entered incorrectly into the database due to which it's not confirming so you need to confirm that first either you can ask the patient to contact the insurance to confirm the information so they can figure it out if the right insurance uh sorry the date of birth is updated in their records as well so you can run the eligibility for this patient thank you very much no problem annie you have a great day take care"}}, {"id": 813, "data": {"call_id":

"sherry hale extension 1049 this is sherry how can i help you hi sherry this is pete i'm calling from curemd how are you doing today hey good how about you i'm fine thanks for asking uh first of all i would like to inform you about ocular prosthetic and it was the hecfa alignment and actually feel confirmed that the alignment is already performed and now we are waiting for the print so now you can actually ask them over for a print alright and uh one more thing for some it because uh we did have a meeting today as well and after talking with you yesterday so the only thing that i get from them that's the uh it's the uh it's the configuration again and the configuration in in a sense like because they did test this out on different modules and even the uh different schedulers as well to make sure if it's persisting somewhere or not so at the end since they were unable to find any discrepancy while uh doing that for multiple schedulers as well so they have actually confirm the configuration one more time at the back end which is actually helping the application to uh get the information of the secondary insurance on the failed at the time of scheduling patient or creating a charge or even the posting one so they did that one more time and they assured me as well that it won't be actually affecting again so in case if it did please ask the practice um not to actually go for the charge and until and unless that is resolved if it appears again take a screenshot record the session any proof which can be actually provided at that time so we can look at it because it's something which actually appearing and i i believe that because it would be this is why it's appearing because it's very unusual that it doesn't actually uh done with the other appointments but at the same time in the between of the years like it's been quite a long time that the patient is in the practice about 2016 is a very long time so what people do is after getting that information we will be able to work on this and we can actually report it to the relevant person who is actually responsible for that process to be done to get the right information populated on the front end now um at this point for simon everything is perfectly fine and um we were unable to find i would say technical team we was unable to find any glitches anything at the end uh which actually prompting or um like actually making the issues while the information was not populating so right now everything is perfectly fine for simon and we need a recorded video or uh any proof um good luck there's not a way to get a record idea so unless you wanna sit on her computer with her and you can record i completely agree with you and i did actually uh tell them sure that there's no way that we can even prove if they deliberated did that so yes it's something which is actually appearing sometime and at the same time it doesn't that's the thing like we are referring right now so i completely agree with you and completely understand how you feel at this time so this is the information i've been given from the relevant team so what do you want me to tell her she needs to figure out a way to record it and send it to me and then i can send it to you and if she can't record it then just tell her she'll just have to live with it and get over it is that what they want me to tell her in short yeah okay because it makes you get it from well i'll make you pass the message for me pass a message for me you tell them that this is a group that's two databases they have 17 providers that they pay for they are a huge chunk of money ask them would they like for this client to leave curemd and find another software because uh the development team just feels like they should just shut up and sit down and just deal with it just you know just humor me ask him how how how how that will work out i completely agree with you and i will pass your message definitely to the relevant team because um at the same time they're telling there's no way to check that at the back end if it's if there's no proof if there's no video or the screenshot so we can go ahead and check it but yes i will pass i've given that though but i've given it and that's the stupid thing so whatever they're just being very very stupid right now so i'll probably have to go above all of y'all heads and have to report this to eddie and have him deal with it and then he's gonna be like well how's your people in development team we're just you know like oh well who cares it's just 17 provider practice nobody needs that i mean that's too much money for us let's just let them leave you know let's make them unhappy so alright i'll let her know she can either figure out a way to record it or and she needs to be in four different places at once for check in checking them out for putting the charge in putting the payment in she's gonna have to figure out a way to be four people in four different places so that would be awesome she's probably not gonna really be happy about it but yeah i'll let her know alright thank you no uh before you go any update on the information that we uh we were waiting for which information are you waiting for is the norman from mondello of the forms and okay uh paul michelle for the claim alignment i mean i don't really know what else you need funder low so let me just go into my emails and look and see what's the last time that i sent anything to her because i don't even know what you need okay i see may 18 you sent me these two forms to have them sign it and did i get those forms back is what you're asking okay alright i just sent them to her again so we'll see if she responds okay alright no problem thank you so much for your time and for ocular we will be waiting for your response alright alright thanks bye bye bye"}}, {"id": 820, "data": {"call_id": "1620322659.752869.txt", "text": "thank you for calling this is brian how may i help you yes bryan im calling from the

i mean you have already purchased the domain yeah we have that for years paying control center dot org i think we have that for years in uh in our website um okay on your website uh thats something that youre using on your website right so thats the domain name thats been already being used on your website this is something related to cure md so you might have to um um so you have to uh purchase a domain name and the ssl certificate again for cure md application this has been different how much is that um doctor it depends uh this is some the the pricing is something thats depending upon the domain name then youre purchasing usually uh for example yeah go ahead oh let me let me check that what domain name would you be interested in buying normally this is something that the client does himself because uh the domain name is selected by the client right so for example im going to go there go daddy dot com thats the hosting provider right and i searched for uh im im just giving that as an example i think i yeah you could get any domain name as long as like uh get the net the org or whatever yeah yeah yeah so uh im just saying if i go for uh cure m pain cure md control center dot com yeah alright so this is according to go daddy its around $1 a month okay thats fine right and if you purchase it would would be s s l uh one pair for the month essential so why dont you set up this for us and i will uh well give you the money bill you or whatever it is um doctor normally what happens is that the client himself selects the domain name purchase it if its something that you need help with i can help it for example if renee is going to the website website and select the domain why dont you uh very good help renee go do it and were gonna do a cure md  pain control dot com

to know he would have been finished twenty minutes ago yep alright well we have adults and your recommendation would be if and when they get another a new server to do the same thing but do it on this server do it on the server itself not on the individual computer thats right okay i mean i mean its better if you do it from the server because we can save the account in the future when you renew it

my name is phil oh hi how are you i'm good thank you how are you i'm good i was just wondering if you could help me with a billing issue um yes sure how can i help um i just have a patient who came in about three days ago and they paid their copay but it's showing that they owe $10 and i think it was just something that was entered incorrectly is there a way that we can do an any desk session uh yes we sure can are you uh am i speaking with carly yes uh i was about to give you a call i'm really sorry i was on a call with another client and i just wanted to like oh that's okay that's okay don't worry do you need the code yes 907,513,170 i'm sending you the request okay i can see your screen now so yeah his patient balance is correct but i don't understand why it's showing 10 for his copay or that he owes us 10 for his copay uh let me check it would have been from the 10th i just think i made a mistake with entering in the payment yeah because it's showing only what i tried to do today it's not showing what went through the 10th i think i accidentally deleted that uh what i can see is that this negative 10 the amount accumulated from this date of service and this date of service on these two date of services there are there's an overpayment of $5 by the patient is but isn't that their copay ah well do we do we post uh your payment postings yeah no no i'm actually asking you because uh we do have like two billing departments and yeah we we post the payment so the thing is let me check let me check okay actually uh the insurance didn't transfer any amount uh to the patient responsibility like what they did was they paid you some amount and the rest of the amount they just written down so that is why this is amount is appearing as an overpayment um can you explain that again i'm i'm having a little trouble understanding now what happens is a patient comes in and uh uh practices do take the copay but sometimes what happens is that when the claim is submitted to the insurance and uh the insurances are paying you like you have billed the insurence like $100 they are paying you like $50 out of it and they're writing off the uh the remaining amount of $50 they are not accumulating the copay oh so they're not like collected they haven't collected the copay yet like it's just kind of sitting in like in the middle um well what you can say is that uh the copay is already been taken care of like this amount you can add it to the patient advances because if the patient has paid you you can add it to the patient advances the insurance is not like uh uh accounting the copay they're just taking care of it thats weird they're paying the amount according according to the e o b they're paying some amount the rest of the amount they're writing it off and they're not accumulating the copay which means that this amount you can add it in the patient advances okay so let me ask you a couple of questions so how how what's your practices workflow when a patient's comes in the patient gives you any payment do you guys post it like this or do you guys uh take it in the patient advances we when we're checking the patients in we put it under patient advances because they're paying before they're being seen but then after is when we post the payment so come in as un applied but then at the end we would apply it now i will i will suggest you for future reference that when a patient comes in you should take the advanced amount that's correct before applying the un applied balance you should wait for the e r a from the insurance so don't apply anything until the insurance takes there until until the insurance uh sent you uh the e r a um because the balance will remain in the patient's account as an unapplied yeah so once once you receive the era from the insurance you will know that how much you need to post okay okay as you can see right now if if this amount wouldn't have been like uh uh not posted uh it's all good this amount should have been still in the unapplied yeah so you can delete this payment posting and you can add the patient advances okay so you would delete um you wouldn't delete any of these right like i would recommend i would recommend you to keep the record of it like over here if you can see that there is an overpayment you can post you can post a refund i do a refund right here and put -5 a negative $5 and you can add the $5 amount in the patient advance make sure you know how you can uh just give me a moment let me just take a screenshot in order to post a refund yes yes in order to post a refund you need to put in the amount exactly like uh negative $5 and this check box will be enabled you should check this box and you will see that the transaction balance is zero and you can put in the comments posting a refund and adding amunt in the unapplied just to keep the record of it yeah yeah now we have saved it and let's post a refund over here as well negative $5 tab over this check box will be enabled check this box close to the same comment okay i see what you're saying it was it was um posted too many times so you just have to refund it uh like over here you have taken you can should take it like one date of service at a time for one data service you took extra $5 so now you're just posting a refund and and also you're going to add the same amount in the patient advances because you're not actually giving the patient un refund you're just documenting it yeah yeah so now as we have already posted the refunds we should add the amount in the patient advances and uh do you remember how to do that um i wouldn't do it here yes would i do 5 or 10 10 i'm sorry just hold on 1 second hold on 1 second sure take your time"}}, {"id": 827, "data": {"call_id":

muhammad ali alrighty give me a moment okay i apologize for the wait may i help you uh my name is oscar and i'm calling in regards to an email from mr ali regarding that you guys are moving over to a different software so i need to speak to him in order to help him out with the process ok that's i'm gonna be the one that you need to speak to i'm the office manager my name is lucy okay lucy how are you doing today good how are you i'm doing good as well thank you for asking so lucy i'm calling in regards to this email where it says um i mean what we have heard so far that you guys are moving on to memorial hermann hospital system which is w yes and uh the background is you have to do it because um the referral system is yeah pardon me yeah in order for us to really on essential but then we have to use one of their e m r systems and ecw is one of them okay when you talk about credential uh you mean credential with the insurances is about the payment plans or you're talking about the referral network it's the referral network along with um in order to be in their actual plaza as well um through the memorial herman system and be credential through the referral program and also be credential through them particular location since it's in their plaza themselves we have to use one of their database systems emr systems okay alright so we can do a few things over here to help you guys out when it comes to cost effectiveness and also help the concerned hospital system we can integrate the referral system so your stuff doesn't have to go through um a conversation longer training curve to get uh you know comfortable with the other system rather integrated so the information gets um transported over to the other system while you're using cure md as well at the same time so that's one thing we can do and also price wise for example uh what are the guy what are those people charging you the ecw i'm gonna have to doctor rasheed has that information with him i don't have it in hand uh no problem then i can definitely schedule something so uh lucy here's what we're we can do uh let's schedule a call uh whenever you're available next based on your convenience uh few set of information that we're requiring from your end because i believe you guys have an outstanding client with us from uh cure md for i believe quite a while so i we provide business consultancy as well uh where we make the process a bit smoother for the practice uh whether they're being acquired or joining a larger group or whatever the case may be so in that case uh we can pull something off uh when it comes to pricing usability interface and integration where it's kind of like uh win win situation for the practice as well and in the longer run they don't have to go through a conversion process of you know retraining re implemented the staff for a different stuff as well so few things i'll be needing from your end one is uh how much ecw is charging you what a service set of services they're offering you so we can you know give you something even better and integrate things with ecw when it comes to the referral program so that way you guys don't have to you know uh work on two different softwares together rather one software will accomplish uh the ecw task as well and also cure md side as well so these are the kind of things that we will touch base and in the meantime uh we can also work on data migration as well because for example in our follow up call if things don't work out and you're kinda like contingent on having to use ecw than we have to go into the direction of data migration so in that way we can uh the templates have already been shared we'll just share the numbers and look up into the amount of data that you guys have and then help you with the transition cause as well also one more good things that we have um uh lucy look do you guys do you uh your own billing like you have a staff that does the billing or you have well we've we've outsourced our billing we have a billing company okay and the name of the company it's uh houston physician billing okay because on this uh just to let you know we have introduced um ai billing that's kind of like autonomous billing intelligence system so what it does is uh based on your practices billing operational behavior it automatically generates charges submits the claims and even follow up with the insurance is where human intervention is not required and if they're redundant cases like for example something is recurrent you're getting a denial rejection on a certain type of a unique scenario over and over again so you can feed the system with the rules uh for example a certain insurance denies your claim based on that your electronical data is not attached from the e h r or provider note so we can feed the system whenever it comes in for this type the system will automatically attach the data of the emr or the provider note section with the claim and resubmitted rather than humans intervening and uh and at the end of the day you'll get the reports and everything that whether the autonomous is working fine so it makes your revenue cycle uh really fast without the uh what you call it a lag and aging of the bucket so this is something that can be deployed not only just cure md even if you guys for example decide to switch over to cure um ecw still you can have it deployed over there so anyone who's well worse than the billing can be nominated to supervise it so wherever instance human intervention is required they can go there but nevertheless this is something that we can uh definitely discuss in our uh next call uh while you guys the information and anything else that you have from for me like any questions or anything before our next call do you want me to looking forward um no i think he's really headstrong about moving over to ecw he's really looking to that being done like as soon as possible so um that's where we're at right now um i know i think they spoke to is it wasif yes our vp oncology he spoke to uh him about it and that's the reason the case was forwarded to me because uh there are many factors and avenues that are unexplored so based on that i mean obviously we're gonna uh whatever the practice besides we're we're gonna respect dot com we're gonna go with that direction uh but the purpose of these calls is to help the practice make an informed decision so if anything comes up that clicks to you guys or personally to you lucy like you're like administrative point of view i like this factor out so we can incorporate that not entirely even if you're not entirely able to retain on factors that could help your practice be more operational more smooth more fluid uh we would definitely love to go ahead and uh serve you in that uh dimension as well so this call is just to you know make a better informed decision for the practice okay um and oscar do you have a contact number yeah i do it's uh 7186849298 with the extension 521 and you can email me with the availability as well just in case you're not able to reach me on the phone my email is gonna be oscar o s c a r dot higgins h i g g i n s at cure md dot com and uh if

know when you're available next or shoot me an email whenever you feel like and then we'll go ahead and further take things from their ownwards okay okay alright you're welcome have a great day"}},

questions were they because there might be somebody who can help you better but i'll try my best to help you okay i need to extend um one of the doctors schedule as is just in it a few months further ends in july and need to extend it further and then there's um it looks like it's green um so i need to remove that and i need to um block one day that design will not be in but i don't want to erase ive left messages for for patients that are already on the schedule but if i block the day i don't i don't wanna erase those people okay so uh amazingly i can actually assist you with this uh so i can extend the doctors uh calendar that is something i can definitely do uh i can place those blocks for you as well now uh relating with the concern that if we do place the block will it affect the patients uh check in and all their information it will will it affect the schedule for that day if you block the day will eliminate the people that currently on the schedule no so actually when you look at the schedule it might look like that it is blocked but if let's say there are any appointments for that day in the back end and for the patient they will still be able to carry out but it'll just look like they're blocked but they won't actually be removed if once we put the block on but will i be able to see okay so i've left messages for these people already i've left messages for the patients i need them to call me back and if they don't call me back i need to recall them so i want to i want it to be visible i want to know who do i need to absolutely that is so that'll happen yeah uh for that i can uh definitely look into that so what i will need to request from you mindy is uh have you by any chance made a ticket for this because if i have a ticket no i am on the phone i can let me speak to okay i'll make a ticket i mean do i have to wait i usually go to any desk uh uh okay uh we can definitely try any desk uh the only reason for the ticket is as soon as you log it in it gets assigned to somebody and we actually have all those pieces of information you want us to take care of so we can yeah so it's more easy for us if it's documented well this is a new policy because i've never had to do this okay logging ticket jesus painted yet schedule modules um what module is it okay i don't know what module it is patient module i guess okay okay i submitted a ticket awesome

keep all of lincoln as safe and healthy as possible prairie orthopedic and plastic surgery hi this is laurie how can i help you hi laurie this is pete calling from cure md how are you doing today good how are you i'm fine thanks for asking actually um it's regarding the rejections for b c b s and i'm actually looking at your rejections right now it was due to the billing tax id no fan correct um well the claim that blue cross provided me showed the tax id number in 24 j okay and 33 b sure we'll fix out for you just give me one moment are you guys are billing some uh sorry there's so many of the claims in a group npi or individual npi it's under individual under individual and i like when i when i go to preview a claim i don't show it like this so these are claims that got submitted electronically so i don't know yeah it's going out electronically wrong or if it's getting switched with the clearing house or if it's once it gets to blue cross blue shield i don't know there's one thing i will actually tell you at this point um we do have your group n p i and um you guys are submitting the claims for b c b s um in e and it's for i'm sure that pair id is triple 780 and you guys are submitting claims in the group n p i 1639206147 and right now uh since you're getting the rejection on doctor george gamble and um i'm just actually looking at multiple plans for bcps at this point give me one moment i'm just looking at it right now cbs and i found another one that's pretty weird because uh doctor is being added in the system already let me quickly find how many okay got you so the specific time which was actually selected on the patient's profile um it doesn't actually have any billing group added in the system due to which because there are multiple uh sorry the providers are being settled by this practice and um as i can see the claims were submitting at the group npi which actually covers everything which will have the right information into the 24 j box which will be the renting provider detail and box 33 will have the billing information now um just give me one moment i'm just looking at it one more time because that occurs when you actually add multiple plans in the system because um we do actually recommend our clients to make sure because if you have the right pair id attached to any plan the name doesn't matter it's the pair id where you're sending the claim but i do understand that that uh sometime you need a different name on the on the display name actually so you can send out the claim or um you can actually maintain your records but um that actually doesn't matter because it's the pair i d which is important at this point just give me one moment i'm looking at it now triple 780 was the extra plan which was expected on the patient account susan j pope and it was done with the under the same provider now the provider was added in one of the groups but that specific plan wasn't added wasn't added on the patient profile so it would have the right billing details now if i search in your plan section there like 12345 plans under the same pair id and we need to actually make sure at this point like we would have every single uh i'm sorry the plan should be added does have the billing group according to what you have for the other providers so you can submit the claims under group npi rather than going for individual but so i mean we've been using the same blue cross plan hooked up to multiple patients completely understandable get paid fine and some don't completely understandable you have 5 plans now maybe four of them doesn't have any group which actually indicates or wrap them under the group n p i and the tax id for this practice because you guys are managing like two um like it it must be like more than 10 i guess uh there are like too many providers you've been submitted the claims for and i think you were not submitting claims under the individual npi because you do have group created against those insurances so sometimes when you actually add the same plan twice or thrice so uh there is a chance to actually um because of course if you add the plan you need to add the group as well the billing group so you can submit the claim under your right billing information which was under the group so i'm just looking at it give me one moment now it was actually due to the information being submitted through the cure m d yep and yes it's not the right thing to actually submit the come in this way give me one moment i'm gonna put your call on a brief hold so i can create the billing group for every single plan un added under the same pair of id so you can uh no no no no no no no that's okay so this is i okay so where are you going to do like we've never had to do this before so did cure do some stupid update to cause this or what i mean i'm not having problems with other payers it's just blue cross and some claims they pay and some they don't and we have the same insurance selected can i ask you a question i don't know that that is gonna help yeah can i ask you a question you can ask yeah can you please confirm who pays you the um like the payments for these claims as in blue cross blue shield yes so the it's the insurance will be paying you right my question is actually i'm actually asking you uh at the end of the day you will be receiving the payments from the insurances right cure md is actually the platform through which you're submitting your details now in case if something happens if anything is updated on the insurances then they will start rejecting the claims they won't be actually asking cure md you're notifying anyone that we have made this change and and now they're rejecting it because the thing is as i can see your records in front of me i can actually show you as well with a screen share session we can go right now and uh it's any desk actually so i'm actually looking at your previous submissions so they were all done under group now i'm not sure who actually add the new plans right and they forgot to add the group npi so they can submit under the group npi at the same time okay so where where are you at looking right now in the submitted bucket like that where you're gonna add okay but where were you gonna go and add like all the providers and everything yeah can we share screen so i can show you yeah one second okay so for any desk are you ready for the code okay it's 927 920 20 yes 020 again 201 okay sending it a quick then yep and then it's so 927020121 got you sending it a request quick please accept okay i can see the screen so yes that's the same uh section where you find the billing groups and if you search b c b s b c b s now you have like zero triple 780 again here and then you have multiple plans but i'm not actually asking about them not these two plans these were recently added in the system if you search this there's no group and if you go to the other one as well you won't see a group either i guess yeah you don't now i'm gonna show you something let's go to your plan section so we would see like how many uh plans are there being added under the same pair id so it was starting with triple seven uh i forgot to give me one moment looking at the rejections yeah 7080 77,780 yeah got you there you go so you have multiple plans added here and if you go to your rejected but let me show you now we need to actually make sure if you you are actually submitting the claims in the past under the group npi for these two these two plans so since you have the right pair id the same pair id doesn't require the name actually so you will need the group npi for these new pairs as well for these new plans as well and i'm not sure there's no need to actually add multiple plans because you have a same pair id under them so i understand that they uh they must be inactive as well and in this case what we will do is we will go for active plans only let's see so the active plans are two only one is this triple 780 and one is uh p i d 77 the other one okay now if you go to the rejected bucket so we can actually see how many claims were being rejected under this specific issue so i was able to find just for doctor joe gamble and due to which i've actually figured that out you were submitting the claims under individual n p i now if we actually go for the text tax uh id problem so that was due to the doctors s s n number because the profile of the doctor is being uh checked it was actually being created under the s s n not the e i n e i n is the tax id combination under which the information will be sent out to the insurance and the s s n will be the uh sorry the social security number a combination of the npi the doctors individual n p i and the taxonomy if you've done the claims under individual npi but um i'm not sure how you guys actually submitting the claims because as to me if you guys have multiple groups for the insurances is you must be submitting the claims in the group because you have a lot of uh providers into your practice database and it should be submitted under the group now if you go to okay now you have uh the responsible band in line this should be s p i d 77780 and if you actually click on these two arrows it will give you the information you need i think you were reported this one so i i was actually i'm not necessarily calling about the ones in this rejected bucket we get letters from blue cross blue shield when for rejection and i mean we've gotten paid like we have that one blue cross that's active in the system that most of these are attached to or most of them should be unless it's the medicare one so it doesn't make sense can you can send me the patient account number changes of ones that have gotten paid and ones that haven't here i'll show you one i'll bring one up for you this is what i attached the copy of the reject to i i on my ticket i attached to claim that blue cross sent back to me is what they showed how they received it so i have done no changes in the system for blue cross see all these paid just fine just fine yet then we get this one then we get these other ones that we can't get to go through and when they sent me the claim for this four or five visits it shows i'm gonna bring up the actual claim let's see alright so so like the thing i attached the copy of the claim that i attached the blue cross at me and they're showing it came across they are showing right here our tax id is showing up in there where which they're showing the tax id showing up in the in j yes uh that's pretty obvious if you're not submitting in the group npi because it depends on the billing groups as well so um did you ask the insurance like they will they were actually paying this information before i have i have talked to them i'm trying to make sure that the information is going out correctly from cure first before i go to the next sure because i just wanna make sure from cure to the clearing house to the insurance is all going okay sure let me actually show you something now how cure md clearing house works and how we can actually make changes when whenever we are submitting the claims through cure md application it depends all on the billing provider so billing provider will have the billing information in case if you guys are submitting claims under group npi now if we specifically check your npi for this 1125580 so i can actually show you how you can actually determine uh from where this specific npi is popping up so you can simply go to give me one moment okay it's maybe it's only your second screen yeah okay i'm just gonna go to npi registry because it will actually give you the right information and it will look for this one it's a group npi for prior orthopedic and plastic surgery this is another npi now it could be due to the locations only let's see the other one which is actually being here if you look at the b c b s old plans and um like for let's just say if this is the one we're looking for so it was actually created okay last update was done by you on 4 19 2021 and according to that you were submitting the claims under this npi and the tax id now it depends on the providers profile as well like whatever in the information is in their profile directly this will actually populate on the claim on the hicfa if you haven't created any billing group now let's just say for doctor joe gamble she has the s s n and the npi so that means if he if she is not a part of the billing group so this information this combination will go under the claim you will have the billing address here like this one and it will be on the claim now my perception what i think what i think it's right is the billing group you need to create the billing group so you can submit your claims under this information under this npi this tax id and this address it may have some similarity but not the npi your multiple providers were added here and i think there must be a reason why you have the npi and the tax id being added here so if you check this npi should we just for for making sure if it's the one that we're looking for is there any way that when a claim gets sent electronically that is getting switched around to not be accurate on how we have it set up i'm really starting at your point when it goes electronically and when it goes electronically through the clearing house because the information being get changed at all no it's not possible because the thing is um our cleaning house team won't have the access to change anything from the from your even um like sometimes it happens if you accidentally send a claim electronically and it was with the different i c d or c p d card we cannot even stop that okay so on this claim that blue cross sent me for that patient i showed you yeah are you able to check with the clearing house to see how that claim came across like i wanna know like what i want to know is that a copy of the claim that blue cross sent me of how they're showing it came up in their system i would like to know what the clearing house shows how it came across i mean i have no doubt that this could be a blue cross issue but that's why i'm trying to narrow it down before i go get all super mad at em give me one moment you see what i'm saying i do understand that like whereas box j 24 j 24 in this specific 1 24 box j will not be populated because the vending provider details are not going in so it will disappear under this claim identifier which is highlighted on your screen and if you look at over here for doctor uh kevin so the okay he has the tax id in here so can i ask you okay give me one moment just give me one moment bear with me lori okay and let's go to the charge i'm just gonna see if it's what was the date of service short it's 48 48 45 i'm sorry that's the same rendering and billing provider but they ended up they didn't send you the rejection on this one let me see they're sending me paper rejections do you have a copy of the rejected um i'm sorry the did they send you via email or did they just mailed to you the rejected letter they mailed it to me can you show me emailed it to me mailed okay mailed it to you yeah they mailed it to me but i mean it's just here let me see if i can find it but then they i called them and they faxed me a copy of how their claim is showing in their system um so according to them if you go to the payment section it would be the same right i'm sorry um if he view the hicfa so we will have the same information here correct this is how they're um let me review this yeah it looks fine that's how it should be that's not how it shows on the claim that they sent me that of what they received yeah it looks everything is fine and uh it could be to uh like system issue as well maybe they haven't gotten any information correctly on their end i would say um i would say like because the thing is you have submitted many claims under the group n p i i would say you should submit under the group information again i respectfully disagree just because we've sent claims for this exact patient just the way we've been doing it and they get paid just fine so in that came in like if you're saying like on this one where you're looking at what was sent electronically why is i mean it does not make sense for this one to show up all funky when the other ones like if this is not looking like how it should to you to match up with how that claim is then there's a problem there but i don't know how to fix it like when you're looking at this so like when you're looking at this one what was sent electronically you're able to see where it shows the tax id and the wrong field and stuff can we can we submit the claim as it is can we submit this claim as it is for now and we'll have an outcome till tomorrow so we would see like if it's still rejects or um accepted can we do that like you want you want me to refile it yeah is what you're saying yes i mean i can i've done i've refiled multiple claims and i'm still getting rejections on paper i mean this is like i've done it on paper and i've done electronically no no you don't need to go for the paper because paper is different and like it will take more time but we always recommend you guys to actually submit the claim electronically because you have a cure id for that and they should be yeah and we have so i have filed all these have been initially electronically but with some of them that have rejected out that's where i've tried to send some of them paper to see if they end up going through correctly to try and get these paid i mean seriously i have like 30-50 claims sitting here not paid i can't just keep sending them electronically from not to go through correctly no but the thing is if it's not actually bringing the information there because i have the face file here in the cure md application as well if it's like changing to something it should be on the file as well the face file which was actually sent out to the insurance i can actually get in touch with the uh sorry the technical team as well to actually look because the information which was transmitted is in there you can see on your side as well if you go to the first file now you can see what information is being sent it's a new claim if you open that up you will see this claim is under submitted under this npi this tax id and even if you look at the other information like this is the patient information going in there is no referring sorry the rendering provider here it's just the location loop coming up and uh that's it nothing else this is the information which was submitted and if you look at the previous file which were actually paid this will actually clear this out that the information was transmitted correctly but sometimes we do uh like face this problem for the other clients sometimes it happens if they don't get the information as it is in their end this must be due to some discrepancy at their end because when there's a discrepancy in our system and if it's not sending the claims correctly you won't be able to see the right information in the even the first file that's the file which actually shows you what information is sent out to the insurance now this is the paid example right 3 9 2021 is the page example sorry it's not that one i mean this one's paid yeah let's let's see that basically let's see the fish one this is the first file you have the right information the same information here same addresses and the same tax id patient information is here pr information is here it's b c b s n e triple 780 then no rending provider just the location loop that's the information and the same information is populating on the new claim as well i think insurance will be the one who should be answering that because they might be getting some problems on their end this is why it's not appearing to them but it does appear on our end which is actually transferring the right information as you can see that i can actually stay on the call and you can call the insurance right now you're you're saying that the correct information correct information according to the paid claim there's no discrepancy between the claim and the rejected claim the right information is populating right you can see that you have the information in front of you there's no difference i found and the both paid and rejected claims so that means that clearly states the information was transmitted accordingly through our system but somehow it wasn't reached there or maybe their system in their system it wasn't appeared correctly this is why they rejected it because if they're rejecting under the same information that is your right to actually ask them why they're rejecting it but it does make sense if the tax id will appear in 24 j and even in the 33 b so that doesn't make sense to me even it shouldn't be there it's not the right spot to have the tax id over there it makes sense to me but it's not populating on our end so this is why i have requested you to some of the claim and we will have an outcome till tomorrow and you can even ask them ask the insurance as well like what's going on like if they process it if they received the claim in this right manner or not i haven't changed anything from your billing group it's as it is like you were uh you were doing before okay yeah alright i will talk with them and i guess we'll see how it goes through tomorrow sure um one more thing before you go for b c b s p i d triple 780 it's the same claim for doctor gamble now i do have a rejection for billing provider text id missing perfect perfect perfect great so i will be calling you tomorrow sure sure we'll do that sounds good i just need this number so i can actually follow up tomorrow as well i will call you back we'll follow up this and uh don't worry laurie in case if they answer if they're not answering in the correct way and if you're not understanding their concern we have the technical team to actually work on that but i'm actually making sure they need to actually inform us they need to actually give us the right information so we can work on right so if we are actually i'm just like like going through the other team they will actually take their time and it will make sure like normally it takes like three weeks or maybe more than that to actually get information because they are not quite that fast responsive to others like uh other than you because you are the direct person who's authorized to actually check this information now we are the third party right so if you do that we will be getting in response but it will take more time so i'm just trying to actually check what they will say what information they have received so we will have not come till tomorrow okay alright sounds good thank you thank you so much for your time i will call you tomorrow you have a great day bye bye

my screen i'll share my screen then one more thing have you guys got any training so far like adding patient anything nothing nothing okay no worries i had a little bit okay perfect then let me open up the database and i'll share my screen with you guys just give me a second okay patients lab where it is i don't know how to get my phone number people confirming reports like test appointments just let me know when you guys can see my screen okay now we can uh which screen can you see the wallpaper you can see the application which one you see the wallpaper okay let me the other screen here have two monitors okay uh i don't know that you guys don't have the access to the application but i i'll do i'll ask uh abigail uh she's the implementation specialist she will create the log in for you guys and she will share with you so you can use it now you know before you know hand side is the only one who got the training on this uh um you know the curemd application the basic flows how to add patient and few other things so i'll just quickly go through you know the basic workflows how to add a patient and how to you know do the basic things for example let's say we want to add a patient that's simple we call will come in the patient model since you guys will be billing only the new patients in there so every patient that uh you guys will be billing it will be you know through this flu you'll add the patient once the patient is added you know you'll get this patient demographic film it has all the information like what's the patient name gender orientation date of birth address city zip code ethnicity religion language race whatever information you want to enter you can enter it in here once it is entered you just simply save it and the patient profile is good to go let me see if there is any existing patients added at least someone might have all the added a test patient i think so there should be one uh test no because i believe oh yeah no one added so this is the task patient so we'll click on the patient profile so someone has already added this patient so this is another workflow for example if you want to look up a specific patient that you are looking for you can search by the last name first name by the plan and if you have the account number you can search it here once you have searched it you just simply click on the patient profile and it will take you to the patient demographics page now you see once the patient is added on the left hand side it gives you multiple options since you guys are gonna use only the p m side of the application so you know the clinical information to provide a note off and and lab option interoperability these are not relevant to you you guys mostly will be dealing in this billing option that is this one and you know the demographics page where you will be entering and updating the patient information the landing page and the patient profile is this uh uh you know the patient page uh sorry i forgot wanted let me let me start the recording uh because you know i will share the recording later on with you guys for your future reference this conference will now be recorded okay recording has started so i was telling you the landing page and the patient profile or in the patient module is this one where you can see the patient demographics so that's where you can actually see that okay that that's the patient profile and everything in there that patient demographics now if you need to add the patient insurance information there is another tab that that with the name of insurance here so if you uh come out here it's uh right now it shows you the log option because i believe i do not have the option to add it okay another thing in order to add the patient uh you need to add the insurances as well now what i will do right now there's no insurance is added i have the list of insurances that you guys generally bill so i will get that list of insurances add enough for example let's just say uh medicare taxes i s an example so i'll add quickly medical taxes here okay so this one is added and i do not have the permissions uh right now to add a new insurance patient profile i'll make sure that you guys have this uh uh information with you guys because uh you know all of you might be working in the billing so you guys need to add insurances and everything in there uh just one moment let me quickly give myself the permissions insurances everything in there okay okay okay now we go back to the patient profile through the same model now where a patient you guys have been recently working on a two up on the patient hot list on the left hand side if you can see so i i can just simply you know use this list to access my most recent patients that have access to so once i click here it will take me back to the patient profile i'll go to the insurance tab see previously wasn't giving me this ad option because there was a permission issue now in order to add a new insurance i just simply click on the add button and it shows up this information from this drop down menu that that's the first one that says plan i will select all the available plans right now there is only one plan added in the database that's medicare taxes since you know your your information your plan list each and everything will be imported uh in the data migration process from your old software so all the plans those are available in your database that will also show up in the drop down list so right now let's say medicare taxes uh this patient has medicare to select medicare then the next is address you know whenever we had insurance there are multiple addresses those are associated with it since most of the insurance 90% of the insurances are being built electronically so this address is just for your internet reference this is not something that goes out to the insurance company if you just for example if you cannot find the relevant address maybe the patient card says that it is p o box 4530 so it's okay if you can just simply select this one because you know this address is just a formality it's not something that actually gonna restrict any of your claim transmission or anything in there now the next is the priority now you know you have to select it accordingly whether you're adding a primary insurance secondary insurance tertiary insurance then you will add a policy number whatever the policy number it will be you just simply added once it is added then if there is a group number then sign on file what is the effective date of that into uh insurance now these are the additional information only the ones those are these are the required information now then we have the claim filing indicated these information are basically something that is automatically populated from the plan profile you do not have to manually select these information another important thing is the copay box over here if you know or if the patient costs is that there is a specific or fixed amount of copay that needs to be collected you can specify it here for example if you know that this patient has a $20 copay you can spend uh simply put that $20 in this box and just save it what will happen uh it will actually save this copay and it will you know populate every time this patient will be scheduled every time uh you know you you will work on this patient now as you can see we we were getting a pop up message telling us that this patient policy number is not valid because you know medicare has implemented new policy numbers so that's why you know there is an algorithm in the application that is detecting that this policy number is not a valid one so we might need to change it or updated to the newer one so there are a few checks there are a few warning signs there are a few internal scrubbing options that automatically check uh or you know the basic things in the application after adding the pay insurance the next thing that might you guys might be interested in as the patient eligibility if you can see under the eligibility right now it's showing p now p stands for pending it means the patient eligibility is not checked yet now if you click on this p it will take you to the inquiry page from this page what you can do you can acquire the eligibility for the patient if you want to change the date of service you can change the data service here and then you will simply hit this inquired button what it will do it will you know send a response uh send a request to the insurance service to fresh the eligibility information now since this is a test patient it has test id and everything in there so that's why we renew that that this this will be the response but if it's an actual patient who has the correct policy number and it has been added into the right insurance it will return you the eligibility responsibility previously it was and now it is showing up as e r that is error it means you know there was there are some error infecting the eligibility if the patient is eligible it will only show up with a single letter e that stands for eligible and the patient is not eligible then it will show up ne that's transfer not eligible so that's how you can check the eligibility for a patient in the application now that's the basic workflow just an overview how to add a patient how to add an insurance profile now is actually let's get started with the workflow how you're gonna enter the information how are you gonna keep the information for the visiting the application since you guys will be billing mostly in the patient profile and the new patients so what you'll be doing you come into the patient profile here okay and you will expand the billing and then you click on quick charge now before i go ahead i need to confirm one more thing will you guys be scheduling the patients on the schedule or not not okay perfect okay got it so once your innovation profile and you have the information with you that okay this is the information that i need to come in for this specific patient you will click on quick charge when you click on quick charge there are a few information that will automatically populate like the patient primary plan information secondary plan information if there is any copay associated with that insurance it will pre populate data service will be by default is current date so today is 5 25 so that's why the you know the default date on the quick charge will be populated as of today now you have the option to change it now for example today you are creating charges for yesterday or maybe for the last week so what you can do you can simply change the date here by clicking here so you change the date to 5 21 and yes over here the reason for giving this option for date range start data service and and data services basically if you are billing for multiple range now for example you have seen a patient for 234 consecutive days and you want to bill these days out and you won't do not want to send multiple claims out there you want to include all this information in one single claim so you can use the data range option otherwise if the start date and end date is same so it will be considered only one single data service as you can see the first option on top it is showing the plan information the primary plan and secondary plan there is a tertiary plan information as well if you want to see this one you have to click these two little arrows on top and if you click on it it will expand the information as well mostly you know usually not all the patient has the tertiary plan primary and secondary are the most common so that's why those are showing up here so just to make this view simpler you know the the the tertiary plan has been added to the details for you then we have the referral and the prior authorization section before i go ahead and explain it to you guys do you guys deal in prior authorization and referrals no okay so you don't deal deal with it so that's okay but just to give you an overview just in case if in the future if you might need it the very flow to add a referral is to just click the hyperlink oh just this hyperlink that is okay do you guys do you guys need to take this no no there are other people here okay so you click the hyperlink referral and if it is an incoming referral outgoing referral you will select it accordingly once you have selected it it will take you to this page where you can add the effective date visits provided information the referral number itself and want to save it it will add up here but since you guys are not gonna use it so i'm quickly gonna skip through this one the next option is for the copay and the advances that this is the place this is the point where you will actually uh key in the patient payments that you have been taken enough there are two workflows if the patient is paying up for his copay or you know any responsibility that falls into the copay then you will select this option this copay option right now it is populated as 20 because we have in a $20 copay and the patient insurance information let's assume that we haven't enter anything so then it will pull up $0 here now at the time visit you got to know that the patient has a $30 copay you will put $30 in here now putting $30 in here will only define or you know put in the notification in the application that the patient has a $30 copay if the patient has paid it then you can just simply check this box and it will be considered that this copay has been paid in so one more thing now you know there could be multiple method how uh copay is paid maybe through credit card cash any direct bank transfer so you just simply click on this hyperlink it will take you to this pop up a window where you can select the you know the copay payment method by default it has been selected as cash if you do not change anything here this $30 payment will be entertained or catered in our report as cash but if you want to change it let's just say the patient is paid through a credit card so you will select credit card here you will select the payment date you will select the type of card it was a visa what was the expiry date okay so that's how we put in if there is any comments any specific payment comments and i click on it now you see this check box is automatically checked and it is considered as a paid amount now it means the patient has paid this $30 another box to take any payment status other than the copay now that could be patients deductible for example the patient might tell you up front that they have a deductible or maybe there is some patient responsibility or maybe this is a self pay patients now the best way to take any payment or any advance payment or any payment for you know the old not the old one for the old balances there is a different for any future appointment or any advance that you want to take this box could be used in the same matter what do you have to do if let's just say the patient has paid $50 because you know he wants to use it for the upcoming appointments or anything in there and in the same manner how you selected the uh you know the method how this amount has been taken in the same pop up window will come up if you click on the advanced options so we selected it as cash so collectively we have uh taken $80 from the patient $30 through a credit card and $50 through cash now the next option is for the location uh by default definitely you guys have only one location it is populating here but in future if you guys have more locations these locations will show up and the drop down menu so you can switch between the locations if you want to i've already explained the data service part then the transaction date transaction date is an important day and um you know i always recommend my practice is not to change this because this is the date transaction date is the date when you charge is actually created so by default you know whatever date my system has today it's gonna select that date as a transaction date but for some reason for example if i had to uh you know create this charge yesterday and i missed it and i want to create it in the back date i can change it but as i mentioned earlier i do not suggest to change and you know change this transaction date because there is a reason for having this transaction date that you guys will understand when we'll be working in reports if we change this transaction date same i'll make it the same as the data service there are so many reports that can help you in order to pull up multiple level of information and reports in there those will be useless for you guys if you are putting the data service and transaction date as same if it is not same i'm talking about this case is where it is not saying but imagine if the patient showed up today and you're creating charge today everything is saying so perfectly fine that's the standard workflow then moving on the claim time this is also a very important field that is uh helpful in the case is actually you received now so what happens in the claim journey when you actually submit a claim to an insurance company so there are possible three outcomes that can happen the first one is that your claim got processed insurance dedicated the whole claim everything got processed and you got the payment so that's the best case scenario and the second scenario what will happen you submitted the claim there was something wrong with the claim and without processing it there are two two phases in the insurance company one is the adjudication and the second is the process so adjudication is like initial screening process so if the claim is in the adjudication process and it got rejected or there was something missing with the claim what will happen it will come back it will come back as a rejected claim i will come back to the rejected claim later on so i will just get the third scenario we're actually your claim got processed and number was associated with the insurance know that this is the data service everything is processed but then they find out that there's something wrong with the where you say logic maybe there is a claim that we're missing maybe the provider the economy is not correct or anything in there so your claim will get denied now if your claim get denied and you have to fix that claim and resubmit it then this claim type option is very helpful for you guys in this claim type option in this claim type option if you scroll it down there are multiple options the one those would be useful for you guys is replacement and why because the w two w three w four w five these are the workers compensation uh claim appeals so you guys might not be using it so do you guys build workers compensation claim yes but you know these are w two w three double four those are appealed if you guys use so the the first three are for the professional claims where you have to resubmit a claim you use the replacement now if you select replacement here when it does it tells the insurance company that this is not an original claim this is not a new claim this is resubmission and resubmission for what you mentioned it here in the original reference number and this box you enter the insurance control number or the peer control number so so that the insurance might know that which was the original claim that you got here uh you know which was denied for some reason now you have fixed that reason and you are submitting that claim now avoid the claim option is used in cases where you want to avoid a claim for any mistake or any other now for example there is a patient uh john john uh adam okay and there's another patient john adam junior so the claim was supposed to be sent for john adam junior but by mistake you submitted the claim for john adam or maybe any problem or maybe the code was not correct maybe the diagnosis were not correct so you know you you you were supposed to build 99214 and you build 99213 so you're definitely you're gonna get underpayment now in order to correct that mistake on in order to rectify it you have to wait for the insurance company to send you a payment or a denial or whatever the response it will be once you have received that response once you have received the denial or payment then you will submit a wide claim telling the insurance company that this is not the correct name i just want to cancel it so when you will send avoid claim the insurance company will disregard the payments and it it they will take it back and instead of that the correct claim that you will submit to the insurance company they will process that claim so that's how you know this is a workflow for using the white claim in the same in the same manner how you were using the original reference number to you know send a replacement for a claim you can if you want to avoid a claim then you put in the original reference number for that avoid claim the original reference number is something that is available on the e r a or b of any claim so you will find it on the movie or the e r a in that claim moving on next the admission and discharge date if the patient is being seen in the hospital and the patient was admitted so you put in the admission date here and the discharge date here now comes the next is the the provider section and the provider section basically there are three types of provider rendering billing and referring renting provider is the one who actually rended the services billing is the one who's npi is registered in billing profile and the referring is the one who actually referred the patient to the practice now in your case this is the provider or this is what you can say your practice information that it is gonna be used as a rendering and the billing as well so whenever you selected make sure applied this provider is billing provider yes because this is the same provider that is gonna be used as rendering and the billing as well so you will select both as you know the same provider if there is a referring provider you will simply add that referring provider here once it is added you again with the first part that is insurance appointment and provider information now comes the coating pod where you will enter the diagnosis procedures modifies amount fee schedule anything that you hold on hold on i have a i have one question yes when we enter the referring provider how to enter different provider ntn number and all this information yes no sorry i didn't show you the workflow correct in order yes i'm showing you in order to add a referring provider you just simply click on this hyper link and it'll take you to this window right now there is not a provider no referring provider added so you want to add a new referring provider just simply click on it the add button it will take you to this page you will select if it is a doctor professor whatever it is selected at the first name last name and then these are the required information name title and npi you have added those just simply save it and come back here the provider will be added here just select that name close it and that name will show up here okay it's we have to enter the referring provider speciality too right uh no that's not required i don't think so it's it's you can add it if you want to but that's not something that is required if you want to add a speciality like for example what this provided speciality is at the bottom this option is available as as i mentioned the three option or the three uh information uh name npi these are the information that only goes into claim file so these are the mandatory if you want to enter every information like qualification hospital employer affiliation address office phone number you can add it you know the the pharmacy you can still add all the information but the mandatory information is title name and the npi oh okay because right now whatever system we have we have to have a referring provider yes i think so uh the referring provider list might also be fetched from your system so i thanks for referring provider will also i will also available here now moving on next the diagnosis and procedure section it's simple like for example if you want to add any diagnosis you're gonna start typing it in for example let's say you say this is the diagnosis you will just simply type in the right now this is coming up and read because you know the list of diagnosis code is not important yet so let me just for example this is a code that i'm not able to add or maybe this code is not important for my practice so what i will do this is a library if you click on it it will pop up a new window for you over here for example if i search for my code that is this oh sorry i couldn't find this one so what i'll do i click the search library button and this code is available here i'll just simply click on it and it is successfully imported now it means that i can use it okay see this code is available now so that's how i can import a code that is not available or even i can search the code for example let's say if you are searching for any code uh let's just say search for covid code so if you search it by uh keyword it will pull up so you know i say that the library it is showing up all the codes that has a keyword code in there so i want to use this covid code and you know since this is the code that i need for the covid testing i will select it now what will happen now i can put in the lab code that will be used for this covid 19 testing okay or maybe whatever the relevant codes you guys are the billers you know which diagnosis you guys are gonna use so eventually you guys will add those diagnosis code here what i'm gonna do well are my implementation specialist will import the default list for uh for your practice since you guys are praying as a lab so they will import all the important codes those are relevant to the lab so you guys can you know easily you don't have to every time import a new code in here most of them will be showing up here but just in case if if you come across any code that is not available what you can do you can simply search for under this library same goes for the procedure as well we have a procedure library as well if you click on it to show up here and if you want to search any code that will show up with your required information or the keyword you can search it by the keyword or either you can search by the code as well so for example let's say you're searching for the office of the code whatever code that starts at 9921 so these are all the codes that is showing up here so that for example i want to select 99212 so we'll select it and i will close it so see it's automatically populated here what what will happen once you have selected here uh sorry there's another thing in the diagnosis code uh that there is a limit for adding up to 12 diagnosis code you can add maximum 12 diagnosis code and for the procedure code the limit is 50 procedure codes so in one single claim in one single charge you can add up to 12 diagnosis code and 50 procedures i'm moving on if the procedure so can we make a template yes yes i'm coming to that point uh let me just quickly explain the fields and i'll come to the template now similarly the data service that has been selected on top it will show up here but if there's a day tranged uh that you have selected on top maybe for four days five days so you can change the procedure date accordingly in the calendar boxes then we have the modify box here you can add the modifies accordingly that you want to use by default will import a list of modifies that you guys you know usually use but if you want to add a new modify i'll show you the workflow by which you can add new modifies in there then we have the diagnosis pointer here diagnosis point is something that basically tell the insurance company that this code is being carried out i guess we diagnosis if i add simply add two here so it means that this procedure code 212 is carried out against this diagnosis okay so if i add one here so it will show that this procedure code for this diagnosis and i can add up to four diagnosis pointer for one cbd codes that is the limit by cms that you can add up to four most relevant cbd codes for one procedure so for example if i want to add one and two i'll just simply add one and two and hit tab so those will be considered as diagnosis pointer then we have units option if there are multiple if there are injectables if there are multiple test that you have carried out then you can change the units here then uh the un option is used here the m j something that is used for the claims so you guys will only be using the un then we have the billing here uh sorry the charges amount here right now it's pulling up at zero because the fee schedule has not been updated but updated now when i'll update the fee schedule in your uh you know billing set up that what will happen the amount for nine and two and two will automatically populate in the this box you do not have to enter the amount every time what will happen the amount will show up in relevant box each time now it has two columns one is for the patient one is for the plan if if it has planned responsibility it will show up in this box and if it has a patient responsibility to show up in the patient box now for example if i have $100 here and you see the plan is selected here if i unselect this plan you will see the amount will be transferred to the patient profile okay so that is something that will happen or these boxes are separately used for adding the plan responsibility or you know whatever you want to select now the plan amount is $100 let's make it $10 okay then we have the provider option this is something that uh you know the practice is used for the dme claims so that is not relevant to you the relevant information or the box to you is this box the last one that's the line note box i don't think so you guys will be uh you know billing any drug codes or will you no no okay so this box is not relevant to you because you know this is only used when there are no specific codes like drug codes are being used now coming to the template uh template is something that you can use or you can create if you have a certain set of visits or certain type of patients are coming in for example i believe you guys might be seeing a lot of patients for covid screening and covid testing so what we can do we can create a template for the covid testing uh now in the template when you click here it will pull up all available templates here okay it will show you templates by name so let me just quickly save this one and i'll take you guys to the other page where we can add a new template oh it should be great in the copay yes so there there might be a few uh when you say error or warning messages that might come up for example this one it says the original reference number is required for billing when claim frequency code is white so see we have selected the claim time is white and we haven't add the original reference number so that's why it is giving us an error now the second is saying the medicare id associated with the visit has expired so you know the claim will be rejected so these are the internal checks that you know helps you in order to identify if there is any problem with the claim or not but if you just still want to continue you just want to ignore it just click on continue and it will still save the charge page uh let me just quickly cover one more thing here and then i'll move on to the template part where we can add a template so the charge is saved now the moment you will check uh save the charge it's always show a few other options come on okay yes so on top you see it is showing me some other options like problem statement and on top you can see the responsibilities has been created previously it was all blank it wasn't showing up any responsibility now it is showing the plan has responsibility of $80 why because out of the $100 80 plan responsibility and 20 that is copay that is patient responsibility and then we have $50 and applied 50 that has we uh that we have taken as in advance now moving on next the next option is to submit the claim now there are two or flows in our application to submit the claim the first one is the individual claim submission through from each patient now if you are in this page where you have created the charge if you want to submit a claim right away what you can do just simply hover your mouse here click on professional okay over here there are three options print preview edi claim edi claim is an option that can be used to submit a claim electronically and you will be using this option 95% or i believe 100% of the time when there is an option available except for the claims or except for the insurance is that does not accept electronic claims now if you just simply select or click this claim option it will generate a claim file now the claim file is something that has all the information regarding the claim i'll show you this is the claim file if i click on it so that that's how you actually claim file looks like it's it's a bunch of coding that has uh you know your billing information your patient information than the insurance information cpt level information we know how to read this file so it comes in handy when we are dealing with rejections but that's how you claim file is encrypted and transmit ready to be transmitted to the insurance company now in order to submit this claim you generated the claim file and then you will click upload the moment you will click upload this file will be gone this claim will be submitted to the insurance company so this is one of the i'm gonna delete this file and i'll show you the other workflow that is much easier one now in that case what will you do you will just simply going into each patient profile one by one creating charges you create charge move on create a charge move to next patient create a charge go to the next patient once you're done here if you want to submit all those patients for whom you have created a charge you see we just created a charge for this patient it is showing up in this claim claim bucket so in this way you can not miss any of your claim let's just say you were working on 100 patients in a day and you just want to confirm that you might not have missed any just come into this bucket and see if there is patient any patient showing up in this pocket if there is any patient here it means the claim is yet to be submitted for that so what you will do you will click here the same day on top you will click on generate claim it was during the claim file selected and upload it i'm gonna do that because you know this is the first claim i want to do the testing as well and this is the claim we know it will get rejected but just to test the work close if the transmission and everything is working fine i'm gonna submit it okay now the claim is submitted you will see once it is submitted it did not show up again it says no record found it means there is no pending claim that needs to be submitted everything that was created it has been submitted already so i'll come back to the claims module in a minute so let me quickly show you how to create charges template so you go to the settings under billing we have charged template options over here you see this this charge template option right now there is none so if we want to add one we'll click on add it gives me further option what what do you want to name the tablets for example we will name it covid or just simply we will call it covid if i want to associate any speciality i'll do that if there's any description i want to add i can add it then we have the option to add procedure modify pointer and diagnosis not for example we know the diagnosis would be you 7.1 then the procedure will be what's the procedure code for covid testing u0005 okay so this is the uh test code selected it do you guys use any modifier okay so diagnosis pointer will be only one see you can add up to 12 diagnosis code and for the procedures the moment you will be adding the procedures these boxes will drag down more so it will give you an option to add up to 50 procedure in the template as well so for example this is the template we want to use and you can create as many templates as you want so we have created only this one so we'll go into the patient profile we're here let's assume this is a new patient you click on the billing quick on quick charge just review the other information quickly that okay everything is fine uh yeah good all good select the provider okay yes now coming to this spot what do you have to do is just click on template selected and see every information will be populated here you do not now this is uh an easier example where there's only one diagnosis one procedure but you know the templates could be complex where there are 567 diagnosis multiple procedures available so you can add as much information as you want and once it is added you just simply have to come on the charge page select the template and each and every information will be populated automatically okay and then you just simply have to save it and move on to the next charge now the workload that i've shown you for somebody in the claims hold on hold on yes yes yes yes i have a question how did you select the template to build it did you just click the word template yes let me go back in the patient profile and the billing will go to the quick charge so quick charge will create this charge now in order to select the template you see this button this option for template so i selected it it's popped up the window now if i want to select this template i just have to click it i clicked it wait for one or two seconds it's already selected here okay oh why did it happen maybe i selected i i might have selected the last visit see the last visit option what it does it populates the last visit diagnosis automatically so i think so i selected it by mistake here bye bye mhm click on template and click on covid that's how you do it okay and i have shown you uh in the settings and under billing you can add as many templates as you want to and whatever you wanna do for example if this is an obsolete template this is not the correct one you can delete it as well okay and then you can add you know your custom templates according to your needs okay so any other questions so far on the charge page let me go back to the charge place then we go back to the charge page another workflow so if you want to see the existing charges that you have already created for that patient you will similarly go on the billing now the quick charge option created charge and if you click on the charges it shows you your existing charges that you have already created or any appointments that you have created it will show you the patient name department date and what's the status status of something that tells you if the claim has been submitted or not now right now the status says filed it means the claim has been filed to the insurance company if it is not filed it will be in charge that it it means that the charge has been created but it has not been submitted to the insurance company yet then it shows you the provider name responsible party name what is the plan balance what is the patients balance now if you want to see a log what has been done on this charge so far you click on this button and it will show you the details it tells you that okay some you know this is the user okay morgan who added the advanced payments created the charges $50 payment then they added the edi claim file then they deleted the file then again created electronic file and then now this time they submitted it so it is keeping every log in here as well so if you want to review it if you want to make any changes in there you will just simply click on this appointment it will take you to the charge page if you want to for some reason if you want to make some changes and you want to resubmit the claim you can make the changes and resubmit so any questions so far on the charge page if you wanted to put a alert in patients account let me put the alert well i don't know i think i know that i try to figure out because you know this is your first training that is where i think it should be let me see that that's basically the clinical thing where they put in the hours and everything it says i believe oh yeah no no mark red flag and you know uh with the red flag what option you know what is the reason you know what is the reason maybe this patient is not uh right this patient does not have insurance you want to add a new reason you can add a new reason and you can save it let's just add a test reason here the first reason so i'll save it so what will happen this patient has been marked or flat come in this patient profile it should show me flag no it's not i'll leave this to your implementation specialist abigail is gonna give you a training and overview how you can add uh you know the flags and the restriction or the proper messages or alerts she will help you and uh you know setting those up so you know that's her area of expertise i'm i'm the billing expert so i'll i'll give you an overview on the billing side so i'll let abigail uh uh you know no after the session to update you guys on this workflow how you can do that okay okay any question on the charges or the spelling close so far now we don't have any questions but once we do yeah definitely totally understand that because you know right now i'm just training you it's textbook material so once you're gonna get to the practical work and you'll be doing actual billing definitely then you will have more questions on the scenarios and everything in there so no worries you have my details you have my email and contact number you can always you know contact me and i'll help you with your workflows now let me just quickly go through these pockets you know i'm just gonna give you a quick overview of these pockets with those are you know just like a definition thing so that later on you know that what to do about those planes but eventually when you guys will have examples when you guys will be receiving claims in these pockets then is it is it kinda makes sense because right now i will explain those things without any example so just to let you know the claim um bucket uh on top under newly created the bucket that is used for submitting new claims as we have seen when we added a new claim in the application or in the database it automatically showed up in this bucket so this bucket is huge for submitting the new claims so the second one is the incomplete bucket as i told you there are some checks in that internally assess the claim so that checks check a claim that if there is anything missing or if there is anything anything invalid with the patient profile so if that is there is something wrong that claim will show up in the incomplete bucket telling you that okay there is a claim and if you click on it it tells you that the patient address is missing the insurance does not have a correct address or maybe the patient policy number is not added anything if there is uh you know that is wrong with the claim it will show up in this bucket and tells you that okay this information is missing but as i mentioned these are a few basic checks these are not detailed checks these checks includes like the patient uh address it will only check if the information is complete or not it won't verify the information if it is correct or not is just it'll just check if it is available or not okay so once you have completed that information the claim will automatically go to the claim claim bucket and from there you can submit it the next bucket are that comes under the process heading is already no response rejected and corrected the overview bucket is bucket where you where your claim will show up if those are not paid for 13 days or 30 days 30 days limit for mostly every insurance any insurance if there it is it'll pay within 30 days uh payment time or the you know the claim cycle so they pay you within 30 days but if they're not paying you 10 30 days there's something wrong with those claims what is wrong what you have to do you have to add that claim uh you have to follow up with that insurance company you might have to resubmit that claim so this pocket helps you in order to assess if there if there are any overdue claim okay so in this bucket it shows you as i mentioned there are no examples so you know it will be hard for you guys to just imagine how the information will look like but it shows you the patient name data service insurance name and tells you how many days it means that uh the claim or this appointment is overdue then the no response bucket most of the practices and user confuses overview with the no response but it's different the no response bucket consists of those claims that does not receive any response from the insurance company now what responses when you submit a claim to an insurance or any any party may be claiming house as well so when you submit a claim you are supposed to get a response in 48 hours now that response could be an acknowledgement that your claim has been processed or it could be a rejection that your claim has been rejected okay but any response it should be communicated within the 1st 48 hours but if that response is not received within 48 hours what will happen that claim will go automatically within the no response bucket now the moment you will see any claim in no response bucket you have to tell curemd right away that there are a few claims those are stuck in no response bucket because this might be due to a glitch or due to uh an error within uh the claiming house or maybe at the insurance and so we'll investigated and we'll we'll fix it that why the claim has not been transmitted in two days then the bucket that uh not everyone like the rejected bucket so rejected buckets buckets where all your rejected claims those will be rejected either from the claiming house or from the insurance will come back and the rejected bucket all your claims those are rejected will automatically land here and in this bucket you know right now we don't have example will conduct and 10 15 minutes separate session to you know review the rejected claims and how to work on those so once you guys will start billing the claims that definitely a few rejections might come in so we'll work on those rejections with you i'll work for the first time and you'll be working i'll assist you will walk you through how you can work on those rejections and then we can resubmit those claims from the rejected bucket now the reason uh for uh resubmitting a claim rejected bucket we have this corrected bucket if you have worked on a claim that has been fixed you just simply market as corrected and then later on when you are done fixing all your rejection and you want to submit those claims you simply go into the corrected bucket that's the fourth one over here and you select all those claims and submitted electronically then we have the crossover bucket crossover bucket is for those claims those has automatically crossed over to the secondary or tertiary insurance respectively if the primary has processed the claim for example in cases of medicare and medicare process the payment what it does it it crosses over the claim to the secondary insurance so you do not have to submit that claim electronically or by yourself that claim is already submitted so and just to follow up on that claims or just to keep an eye on check on those claims we have this crossover bucket here so that you would know that which claims have already been submitted or which are not under crossover we have secondary crossover bucket then tertiary crossover bucket the last bucket here is the problem list well the problem list is like a trash can or a trash bin curemd application why because every time if you create a claim or it has been submitted to the insurance company we are you know it's it's according to the cms guidelines does not give you any option to delete that information by any means you cannot delete that information from our system why because there is a third party claiming house or insurance that is involved in this transaction they know that there is there is a patient that exists under the patient test a claim was submitted for example let's take an example of this test claim that we have just submitted the claim will be submitted to the insurance company they're gonna process it they will reject it or whatever transaction id they will assign it to it they will have record in their system so that's why we cannot delete that record or that charge from our application so that's why we have the problem list what problem list does if there is something that is faulty you want to delete or you want to move out of your bucket you can just simply added to the problem list this way no one would have to work separately or no one would have to you know keep a check that which are the claims those does not require attention whatsoever so that's why the problem comes in very handy it is available on different module as well so in each module it serves the same purpose to keep those information those are not necessary for you separately so this is just an overview of these different buckets and yeah there there's another bucket that submitted bucket uh submitted bucket is bucket where your submitted claims shows up for example this is one claim that we have just submitted it's our test claim see it shows you that what's the user name who created it was the date it created on location what's the total amount and what's the status so right now you see there is only one file that is showing up it means we have only submitted it no response has been received it for response comes in another file shows up and if an insurance response comes in the third file also shows up so that is a bucket where you can actually see your submitted claim then we have the unsubmitted bucket it's not actually a bucket we're actually show you the claims that is ready to be submitted no that's a claim claim bucket the unsubmitted bucket sorry it's consists uh the claims those are left out or those are not submitted by mistake okay for example you generated a claim file but you didn't submitted it okay in the claim claim bucket you clicked on top you clicked on the claim and when you while you were about to submit it anything came up you got a call to provide a called up or anything happened you did not submitted that claim when you scroll away you scrolled way that claim for that claim the claim file has been created but it has not been submitted so that is where it will show up under unsubmitted bucket what you will do you will just simply submit those claims from this bucket or if you want to delete those you can delete those so these are the few buckets those are available in the claim module as i mentioned earlier i totally understand that you know this might not be making a lot of sense to you guys because you know there is no actual data available here to look at but once you're gonna start billing your basic workflow is you know going into the patient profile creating charges through quick charge and a billing adding insurance and submitting it so this will be your first workflow that you will be falling at least for the next one or two weeks so you will get enough hands on experience then eventually these buckets are these different uh modules are gonna come in handy you will be using those and after two weeks when you'll be billing your data migration will be completed your data will be available in our application so you guys can actually go live go live means like you will use the application or it's full capacity because eventually the payments will come in you will post the payments and all that so that at least after one or 1.5 week will conduct our next training that will include the payment posting workflows because you know i i will show you how you can post the payments and curemd application so it has to settle the outstanding balances okay any questions so far in the claims module yeah exactly yeah i understand because you know right now you guys haven't worked once you will be working i expect you know a lot of questions or a lot of uh you know craze coming from you guys so i'll be ready for that so uh that's it for today's training yes we have a couple questions yes yes go ahead is this um software is it like a cloud based or do we have to download it uh it's cloud based uh it's it's like a website see on top uh you do not have to download it i will share the link with you guys in fact abi will share the link and your user name what you will do let me show you what happens for example let's say you just simply open up your any browser you will you will you know enter your whatever cloud information you guys i believe you guys are on cloud 19 you will enter your user name password and log in and this application will pop up just like this okay so you do not have to download it you can access it from any software which has internet access or any computer that has internet access what about um when we see patients that come in for a covid test like we see them you know face to face what if we get one of those insurance scanners how could we like make a profile for patients insurance scanner or can you please elaborate a bit more what do you want to do like um or like i d scanner um whenever whenever i was going through like talking to someone that the salesperson they said um when the patients come in to take a covit test because right now we have them fill out everything like on paper so we could just like scan their insurance card and driver's license and if you can it'll populate you can again i won't comment on that because this is something that abigail explain it to you because you know you're the first front desk training i think i'll ask abhigail to conduct one more time with you guys so that you know she can able she will be able to answer your question on that side okay okay no problem so i'll ask abigail to conduct any session with me today tomorrow so that you know since you guys are gonna start to do billing so you she will be able to answer all your queries before that time and one more question yes yes everybody everyone has to create a login and password yes everybody every everybody will have your separate log in and separate user name because you know that that's how the application works they will have their own separate log in there so that if anything or any any any specific entry any specific action is done by that person he or she should be responsible for that oh definitely okay i will send a link yes uh i will send you the link and the login details for each of you separately so uh that's it for our today's training i will put in a request for abigail too you know conduct a quick overview station with you guys for your front desk on front end training so you guys you can have your queries answered by her okay thank you so in the meanwhile i'll be initiating the enrollment and uh so you guys can start submitting claims through curemd okay alright thank you so much for your time guys thank you have a wonderful day thank you you too bye"}},

please accept great i can see your screen now um okay can i ask you are you trying to post an electronic remittance advice or the manual payment posting um well let's do both but for right now first i want to do um a what am i trying to say a regular there was a paper check the paper deposited now i need to um you know post that to the patient's account so let me pull up her account and we'll go from there sure is that the park where she park she is men so what i have is a $35 check that i want to post against data service let me see which data service just hold on one second sure i'm looking at it tells me what date of service uh february 4th february four february four is there there's 30 35 outstanding so you can walk me through sure so $35 are outstanding right now and we can actually fix that for right now so going to the payment section will actually allow you to the post payments so if you talk about the very first appointment which is april um sorry it's february 4th 25 $35 are outstanding in the patient's responsibility so um can i ask you i can see if you click this small button it will actually have uh give you a specific idea like what payments were posted before so we do have aetnas payment and according to this payment $66.95 were paid by the insurance transfer was 35 it's just being showed under patient responsibility because transfer okay whatever the transfer amount is if it depends like what is the next responsible now you can actually select the next responsible whenever you're posting the payment according to this specific payment this aetna payment the next responsible was patient due to the $35 appearing in the transfer section is coming under the patient account now right off it's something it's just been out it's been out from the actual amount is the right off amount is 104 54 cents are there from the aetna now can i ask you are we going to post a patient payment or insurance payment patient patient payment um a personal check yes perfect is it going to be a $35 check yes perfect great so it's really simple you can simply go to the payment section by um expanding billing for any of the patient you need to actually click on this appointment date to actually post a new payment in case if you're trying to make any changes to a specific uh posted payment you can click on this date so since it's a new one you will click on the appointment itself now what we can do is we need to make sure what should be the payment by normally it will actually have the name according to the next responsible so it has the patient name on the top now you can actually move this payment method to a check since it's a check right now you can enter i will actually ask you to enter the check date check number and yeah you can actually add the deposit you can even add the deposit date as well bank name can be selected as well so completely up to you what information you need for the record purpose so you can add it right away okay one second check number seven perfect okay and let me just give me one quick second to read and catch up okay payment made by her payment method is check check date and then claim control number if i wanted to but that's not i don't have that extra patients uh information to deposit date was back on uh dash why is it not going let me go like this mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm this looks good and then come out bank name is okay that's not there oh this has okay i'm with you keep going sure give me one moment alright so once the details are added over here so we are ready to actually put the paid amount because allowed is something which will be determined by the primary insurance only it will not be determined by the secondary insurance even secondary insurance have mentioning something in the allowed section please make sure you're not entering value posting the secondary insurance payment now since it's the patient so that's of course allowed amount will not be determined by the patient it's just the paid amount now we will simply add 35 over here 35 tab and then we will make sure it doesn't have anything in the right option right off option even this box will be checked if you're processing a refund since it's a paid amount we're not checking that so all done we're all set transaction balance okay wait wait wait wait wait wait wait one second no i'm just writing notes on a side note the amount paid refund okay um i'm i'm with you keep going perfect so it's uh right now it's everything is perfectly fine transaction balance is zero it must be zero to make sure like you're you have posted the payment correctly so $35 where do you see the transaction amount okay there we go thank you okay one second make sure the transaction if if it's gonna be a zero balance i need to make sure that the transaction amount is here okay it should be zero as a matter of fact let me change that double check uh check the okay continue perfect now we are all set next responsible is still under the patient account you can change it to any other person but since this appointment doesn't have any open balance anymore so we can simply seve so just save this and it will take a few seconds and you'll be seeing that there's no open balance available in the patient account you can simply go to the payment section one more time it doesn't show you anything we have zeroed out both balances and if you expand this one you will see $35 were actually posted today by under your name and it's for the patient payment so transferring zero paid is 35 so that is actually uh resolving everything like it's zero out patient balance and the plan balance perfect anything else that's all i needed for today no problem um that's it do you need that do you need that ticket number again so you can close it or did i think i do have both tickets for your practice so i will actually closing the uh latest one is a duplicate and we'll close the uh like older one as a new ticket or you you can say with the information we have discussed on this call okay okay thank you"}}, {"id": 861, "data": {"call_id": "1622568835.1210587.txt", "text": "darina speaking how can i

from CureMD how are you doing im great alright so nicole i've just contacted you regarding your ticket for the prescriptions uh so i just wanted to confirm because i was not able to understand uh which prescriptions do you want to send to the pharmacy now this is just a general sort of a generic question um when i send the prescription to the pharmacy right what typically happens i say i discontinued this prescription i no longer want to give it to the patient typically i have to have the medical assistance in the office i would have to have them print a copy of my d c order and then fax it over to that pharmacy mhm so that's that's a whole lot more leg work why is it that we cannot just dc it ourselves and send it back to the prescribing pharmacy that we had initially prescribed to why is it that we have to print it you guys don't have a system where we can discontinue it this as well as reside it okay like do you you want to like if you see you mean that if you send a prescription you want to cancel that prescription correct when i cancel i need the pharmacy to receive it immediately just like how they receive it when i write but right now you don't have the access to cancel correct i don't whenever i discontinue prescription i have to call the office and tell them that continue can you fax a copy of that over to the pharmacy that's the only way the pharmacy we don't send that to the pharmacy the pharmacist is not aware that i have discontinue the prescription mm yes yes okay okay uh let's just give me a moment just let me just confirm one thing and i'll just get back to you this is oh where else can we go where is the point alright so nicole thank you for holding so nicole yes uh we do have this mechanism so right now you don't have the access to you like cancel the prescription so what i'm gonna be doing i'm gonna be doing giving you the access to your on your profile on the provider profile to cancel the prescription so that uh whenever you would like prescribed prescription you can cancel the prescription after some time as well or there and then as well okay well the pharmacy received the cancelled prescription yes yes yes they will receive the cancel prescription they will receive the cancellation response that you have cancelled this prescription and they will just receive the cancellation response once you cancel it okay okay and what do we do to allow them is there something different once i go into the prescription and i press d c is it automatically steps that i need to do uh when you when you go to the prescription you will see the cancel option or at the above so then you can cancel the prescription as well can you put that for all the providers in the office myself patricia smith okay okay elected we all need that active okay sure i'll just do that and give them all the only provided is required access okay don't you worry about that okay alright something happened with the pharmacy yes yes i can understand i can understand so once you get this cancel option request like the cancel access so then you can just select the prescription and you can cancel the prescription at the top you will be able to see the cancel option okay okay alright alright take care nicole have a good day bye bye"}}, {"id": 865, "data": {"call_id": "1622824074.1304927.txt", "text": "thank you for calling the pearl health clinic if

regards to a support ticket you logged about noval health right uh could you tell me doctor um uh what is uh that you need um you mentioned that uh optum does not accept them detail health platform uh can you please explain well so optum as a part of uh telehealth certification mhm so they have list of uh it seems majority of the platforms and then they then they accept so they had like uh 50 platform they accept and then they had like 1520 platform they don't accept and CureMD name was there and it wouldn't like and wouldn't allow me uh to a test that i have a platform that they accept which means i cannot put it on under my uh profile that i'm doing telehealth okay um can you tell me what exactly is optum uh what exactly is that they do so optum is part of the united healthcare though you know mm the big umbrella company so optum uh i believe it handles their mental health uh side of uh issues like optum behavior or health so they i think they handle the mental health part okay alright and uh you need to send uh what exactly to optum because i i'm gathering all the information because uh this might uh be relevant for some other uh team who can help you out with it so um you need to send so there was no there was no noval health now is noval health known by any other name uh it's uh just noval health and telemedicine alright so so they didn't have that uh in the list of acceptable platforms okay so so we yeah you guys need to figure that out because as you see mental health is becoming uh huge uh issue and then they i've expanded the services alright okay so uh i need to figure out why uh noval health is not on the list of acceptable platforms and optum and um what exactly one more question doctor what exactly is that you need to send to optum i don't need to send anything i just need you guys to see if you can uh contact them so for example if you need more information about optum maybe your billing department might have because they are sending uh our claims to them all the time okay and and and if you can include noval health platform uh in their list that would be helpful so they have called me three times and telling me to do that i have my if i'm doing telehealth so they are not saying this is optional they're saying if i'm doing telehealth then i need to have a platform uh that's on their list that's acceptable to them okay and this is something i think related to billing team correct doctor uh i don't know if it's related to the billing team ultimately everything comes down to claims right right right but it is also my credentialing that if i i want to continue uh using the telehealth then i have to have an acceptable platform right right right i get your point doctor uh let me talk to the relevant team and see who can help you out with it and uh let's escalate it and see what we can do okay alright thank you thank you doctor take care bye bye"}}, {"id": 871, "data": {"call_id": "1622826999.1307015.txt", "text":

you good now how are you good let'see Yes first of all sorry that i kept you waiting because i was in the training so you know i just got free so uh i called you earlier but your number was uh you know giving out the busy tone so should we do the screen share so that i can show you do you have any desk in your system The Anydesk any desk it's a screen sharing software I does just go to any browser like google chrome or firefox search for any desk dot com and it will take you to the website okay let's see anydesk i need this how do you spell a n a n y any like anything a n y n e d e s k desk as in table desk ok download yep it gives you an option for free download just click it ok If it's here or no it says opens up it will give you a code a nine-digit code yeah it's five four zero seven o one two two three okay i am requesting to connect it to give you a pop up just accept it can you see a pop up okay perfect i can see your screen now can you take me to the application so i just put allow access or something just click on allow access and uh let me see how do i get the size here so i'll do it uh my my alright good to any patient just do the ones that i have here okay now for example let me check the controls now if you're looking at any existing charges that this patient have for example this is the one on which you have to add any psdt referral code okay so here we have the option here we have added this option e p s t d referral code right now it's great out why because this code has not been checked amount as an e p s t d services the moment you check it see now this is available right now this is enable but before doing so before uh you know uh putting this information in there you have to select the reason code here for example new services requested or whatever it is then you use the referral codes y d y m y h accordingly okay so that's a several or just one uh you can select one because you know the referral for on one claim would be uh only for one code okay and for the modifiers you know that functionality is already available in our application like for example if they are requesting you to build with the specific modify any new modify if you can't find it just go under settings billing and then modify look up the modify that you're looking for if you're able to find it that's okay if you do not find it anywhere this simply added for example let's say they want you to build a modify one one okay for example this is a test one you just simply have to add that one one here no description no comments those are optional not mandatory if you want to add it that would be a good thing for internal reference otherwise just add the modify and save it it will be saved that's it that's how you have to modify the other you know this was never a problematic thing the problematic thing was the e p s t d referral code and it has also been implemented almost yes uh you know today i find out another issue with the e p s t d and uh thanks to you most of our customers are using this now because you know previously they weren't using they were simply you know refusing the referrals and all that stuff but now they are using this referral thing and they're saying well this is good i was like yeah thanks doctor as well because she's the one who pointed it out so now this e p s t d referal code it's not mandatory that you go ahead and submit those claims on HECFAA you can submit those electronically as well okay because you know sometimes most of the time in fact it's much easier to submit the claim on uh electronically rather than you know printing it out and submitting to the insurance company so we have implemented for both HECFAA and the EDI file as well so it's your choice how you want to go about it if you want to submit the paper claim you can you know simply proceed uh through claim and print this one out and if you want to submit it electronically you can go with there just like any other claim and submit the EDI claim in there okay that it will populate the e p s t d referral code and everything else okay and that would be that ten b of the claim form right yes candy candy and the claim form let me let me just show you one time before we go ahead now for example we are here let's enable e p s t d just for the testing purpose select y d save it if we go on the claim professional let's just take a test print a preview not actually a print so over here in the box tandy here it is that's good that's what i imagine that was the only thing we need so yeah for you and for me trust me you know that's what i every time i went for the follow up and i was like it's simple referral quote for god's sake please add it please add it and they were like dude we know what we are doing there are so many complications on the back end they have to do the verification and all that stuff so you know i know they're following their own process and all that stuff that's why it took some time but uh it was it was created um you know almost a month ago but again the verification and few other glitches were in there so we we tested it for internally for fifty two to three weeks and then when everything looks fine looks fine i sent you an email about two weeks ago so then it was finalized that okay it is good to go because you know if we give you a raw product which is not tested which has some glitches or maybe some problems we can fix it on the run time but it's gonna create a mess for you guys because for example we don't know you might have thousand claims depending for this identified exactly so if you submit thousand claims considering that okay everything is fine those thousand will come back imagine the hassle you're gonna blame us even more than what you guys have done my claims are not getting processed so that's why we wanted it to be uh you know on on on spot for the first time so that you know any claim submission or any transmission that needs to be done that needs that should be done purposely so this is implemented this is complete now you can use it on all of your customers who require it and you can start submitting claim in case if you got any any issue any rejection or any problem regarding this one just send me an email and i will get it looked upon right away but i hope so um i'm ninty five percent sure that it is finalized and everything is okay okay you can give me that other five percent okay so i hope i hope it will um you know fix uh all of your claims and you can submit those and one more time yeah one more time i apologize for the delay but i'm afraid that it is the policy that is the SOP that you know they have to go through a long approvals and all that stuff in order to make uh you know changes in the application at least with this insurance i have six months for the billing so don't delay it anymore go ahead and submit all those all right thank you no problem have a wonderful day you too bye bye"}}, {"id": 877,

it's all good are we waiting for anybody right or is it just fill uh it'll be me but brett will be joining in shortly as well oh no problem so i guess when i spoke to abigail this morning she suggested we have a call internally to talk about macomb cancer and just to sort out what needs to be done i don't think he's um replied unless um i'm unaware to fill about data migration or anything like that or what the next steps need to be for billing so abigail add what you think but you said you wanted thought we should have a call to discuss this yes so edward do you have a look do you have something about how the data looks like and you can even forecast on these things um actually uh windows which they have um talk about so we are aware of the data that we are expected expecting from them um carrier is clearly p m it's just a text based excel sheets will be shared trying to reach them we we won't be able to accept them from the system secondly practice version is one of the other uh vendor they will assist them to help to get the c c d files from the system she should be is uh like clearly clinical side but i um in my email i responded back to him and i said that we need provider the notes and documents mapping as well which the practice will share them share with them later on after the ccdf five so i cleared out all the points which are like mandatory for him to just make sure we're on the same page i was waiting for the better from where he needs to contact you and give us a better for pm please and he hasn't done anything correct no he hasn't done anything he hasn't signed up form the migration request form um i tried to reach his office on friday yes um but uh i couldn't reach him so on the billing side as well uh same scenarios on the billing side as well we've been trying to reach them like three times and reminded them to send us the uh billing information so that we can initiate the enrollment and uh also the authorization to initiate the enrollment but i'm reaching us back i have uh uh you know call the doctor like three times today i will be able to just okay so he hasn't signed the data migration request form to start even getting carriers information to you and he hasn't signed has he signed the billing discovery or not the billing discovery is like partially completed like the last discussion which we did with the provider uh brett actually fill in some of the information but we still want to uh want the doctor to fill the rest of the information but uh he didn't respond on friday he told me that he will be he will get back to me by the end of the day but he didn't okay so i gather from all this abigail i'll send him an email today and map out everything that he needs to fill out the final finish filling out the um so we can start the enrollment we need permission to do that he only partially completed that he needs to finish that he has to fill out the data migration request form and sign that and send that back and then he has to reach out to carrier into practice fusion correct yes i have sent him an email i can also loop you in uh okay that's fine okay so if he really wants to move forward to get the billing done as soon as possible and he's got to cooperate so i'll send him an email yes so um data is the is a critical piece so um edward do you think that it's gonna be a smooth uh process getting the data and all do you do you send any um because sometimes vendor resist or don't respond yes yes what are your thoughts yes i did that i uh i did that the migration from these two vendors is not complicated uh we have done it so they give hard time in getting data not at all only the practice is supposed to reach out to vendor and this he's actually um he's not reaching out or he hasn't uh informed them that he's uh leaving carrier because whatever he suggested i did that on the very next day i in fact uh send him the email that this is what he's supposed to send out to carrier um and i told him like we're doing all what we can in our we even i documented the points that we have discussed and that is clearly explained that what what are the requirements after sending emails i waited and then i called him because in in this mentioned like uh uh he preferred to be uh like reach out to an email rather just calling me because he has a busy schedule so i had that thing in my mind so i sent him an email first then i tried to reach him on the phone on friday to see if i can just stop them directly but no you're right i mean you push him to just yeah so chris i think we are going to mention this very clearly to the providers that we will be able to forecast go live or even tentative go live once we have our hands on um on the data without it we can we can have a tentative date but we cannot give surety that will be able to read it but of course we're gonna say that in very softer tone yes yeah mhm so we'll we'll get an email out get it in writing to them yeah got it because um data migration is something that once we have the data edward will let us know that how did it looks like if it needs cleansing if it's good to go according to that so it's going to set the enrollment time and according to that i will set the training timeline mhm yeah right okay okay so i think now let's see what response to this okay i'll cc everybody on the email makes sense that sounds like a plan so until we have something free to talk about thank you everybody thank you no problem thank you thanks a lot bye take care"}}, {"id": 889, "data": {"call_id":

presenter okay can you see my screen um yep it's loading up yeah i can see it now okay so let me just show you so i'll start with the care plan but there are three things that i want to do with it so i'll start with the care plan template um okay so it says um i thought we were gonna have like the two blue tab that you sort of click on and only fill in whichever one is applicable or is that not possible uh i'm sorry could you please repeat the question i thought we were gonna have like two of the like blue hyperlinks where you click on whichever one is applicable or is that not possible on the letter template yes on letter templates we have some restrictions so that's why i have added the drop down okay okay fine um now here why is it that the first one on the right left and this is like this just that oh that's what the default so thats why it is blank okay mm okay um is it possible here by the date of the ultrasound first of all to create a line where the date will be on and for all of these things that are dates can they be like a calendar where they select the date so that way that we know that or or make a restriction that like something that we know that it's gonna be a validate that entered like so that there's no like typos or something where they end up entering the data and we're like oh that that doesn't make sense that's not a correct date okay so then again on clinical letters so we do have this option in the custom form but on clinical letters since this is just a manual table that we have created so we will not be able to give you the calendar option uh can you scroll all the way to the top i just want to see if we have a date uh section over here can you please hit the save button okay can you reopen the letter no so date is uh something that provider needs to enter manually they have to type that in okay can you put a is it is it possible to put a whiner box here so that they just noticed that this is a field that they should enter uh yeah that i can do okay um and then um by the arterial this should say artery not vain okay i'm changing that right now sorry about that and the right left could also be a drop down like the same as above it could be a drop down like right left alright just give me one moment i'm doing it as we speak yeah perfect okay can you try reopening it so you can see the changes or just give me one moment let me just add uh the text box as well uh you know where they're supposed to enter the date you can do that this one also the arterial also yep that is done okay i'm not seeing the box i see the other thing this is correct i'm not seeing the field here just give me one moment no problem okay so you should have a text box now if you reopen it i mean you have to recreate the yeah perfect could you do the same by the arterial yep okay just put a line in there yeah i just okay okay okay that's done perfect okay now i'm gonna review it with the doctor but i think this looks perfect okay so we have a care plan um now on the note um mhm okay so two things here first of all like the favorites we had um initial concept follow procedures and we also have had a favorite list for radiology and it used to be here i'm not sure where that i'm not sure why these other tests are showing up other test is gonna be there because this is the default list uh in the system so that's that's why it's in yellow so the blue ones are the ones uh which we have created for you specifically and uh the list for radiologies so since is it possible to remove the other test it has to be there um we would not be able to move it or remove it so the blue ones are always gonna be on top and the yellow one the other test is always going to get the bottom okay its fine okay if you know where the radiology list was sure just give me one moment let me check that real quick uh okay so radiology list was actually created under radiology uh component let me just quickly go ahead and add it under procedures as well so that's where you'll be able to find it sure and here was um okay i'll let you do that and then yes just one moment yeah okay you should have the list of favorites of rediology under the procedure section okay great um and then why why is um why is the varicenna one yellow here uh you are under diagnosis yeah okay just give me one moment let me see that real quick varicenna um okay just give me one moment i'm just uh trying this in mind as well um okay can you close the window and reopen it um okay can you go to uh the patient chart under registration and uh then profile yep and then click on clinical on the left hand side yep and then go to diagnosis right above orders and results okay can you click on add and see if it's coming up in yellow here too okay i'm actually not sure about this one because on my end is coming up with in uh in that shouldn't be a problem alright just curious whatever but if you could you could check into it at some point um then the last thing is that so i reviewed with the doctor this um new section that we put in um this patient history treatment which is very happy with but he said besides for like the notes about their previous treatments typically uh like medical history surgery surgical history medication like all this history stuff which um you know really shouldn't really change and if they do then they could just no only items that change um but that should really carry over as well these actions also carry so you are talking about the histories so specifically appointment they have to just like confirm again that everything is still the same that they're you know confirm again which medications confirm again any changes in history or surgeries so really everything she cares about anything confirming anything changed so it does uh so all the clinical components including the medical social surgical and you know family history along with allergies and medications so they always uh carry forward in the next provider note just give me one moment um are you sure yep because this information this information is coming from the patient's clinical charts so for this patient we don't have any such uh history so i'm gonna go to one where we maybe we put in some information hold on okay so this okay so we put in medical history surgery history medication so let's see no because he was okay so it is here it wasn't and uh one more thing one more thing before you exit out of this page so let's say that in any uh provider note template you know for initial and uh follow up template we do have all these history components and all the clinical components on the templates but for procedures uh i mean uh there are a couple of other templates that you have in the system in which these components are not there or probably you know if they haven't removed by the provider themselves so you see that the right hand side you have an overview tab and then next to it you have a history tab right that that's actually just a quick peek for the provider so if if they really want to see all the information about the patient history so they can simply click on history again you do that for me please right so if he's gonna procedure note where it's not in here this will still show up on the side exactly so if he if he specifically wants those discussions to come up on procedure note will he be able to add those in yes so if any of the components he wants those things on the procedure note itself or diffferent physician um okay thank you that's why he didn't see it maybe he was doing a lot more of the procedures maybe he just pulled up the procedure no that he didn't see this um so i'll let him know that it shows up on the side but if he wants it in the procedure note we could add a new sections so i'll review that with him and i'll let you know if he wants any additional changes um okay other than that i think we're good now all right perfect and one more thing that uh on the right hand side where you're seeing the histories and overview so this is just uh you know uh this is read only you cannot export it to the provider note if you want to add it to the provider note then that needs to be done from the left side so on the left side you have the history section so if you expand it there you have all the history of whichever one you need just drag and drop it on the note and you will have it there or maybe just click it and you know it will open it up it already exists that's why it's not adding it to the note yep everything is already in here and then he will add it in the note yep exactly okay interesting okay great okay so let me uh let me check with the doctor and i'll uh i'll get back if you need anything else alright sure thing no problem thank you so much simon i appreciate it no problem at all thank you for your time shawnie take care have a good day bye bye bye"}}, {"id": 898, "data": {"call_id": "1623084623.1343.txt", "text": "hello hi this is evan

you so much so you were just calling i was um since we parted after the last call um my computer is not working i am having issues with my google email i can't print anything every time i attempt to print it crashes whether that's just printing an email printing any form of a document from anywhere pdf it doesn't really matter um and i can't even use microsoft is um so which is where all of my favorites and everything are saved so i don't have any clue what transpired um but it's not functioning and i can't work alright i'm so sorry for that inconvenience to let's do a remote session on the computer let me take a look but can you tell me what changes were made on to your computer and by who you're the last one that touched it when you were trying to do the export helped me with trying to figure out the exporting of the excel document out of the ad hoc reporting tool oh okay all right let me take a look mm we're gonna come through any desk and it's 268541293 alright i'm sending you the request alright i can see your screen i'm gonna take control of your computer okay uh have have you saved it here well i don't need to save anything save anything there so i'm i was in my where did it go um let's see let's try to just do this so if i go in and i try to print so if i try to print a file pdf word any of it it crashes my system it says your pc ran into a problem and needs to restart and this is every time and then i just tried printing just an email out from my google email and just trying to print the email alone crashes it and puts it into restart so it's like every time i'm trying to do something it's forcing my system to restart okay i can see this is certainly right now so now i'm back at the beginning which i shouldn't have to that shouldn't be right well why it was not uh you know bringing into the system probably the the the the problem was there but let me see what's going on exactly uh can you can close this window i i did i'm so now i'm back at my blanks i'm back at my desktop okay well it's for me and my screen it's stuck there right because it crashed so it just because it crashed it's restarting which means it's disconnected you from any desk it's basically made me log right back in and start over as if i was logging back into my computer all over again from trying to print so here's what i know when we were on the phone earlier i was trying to do something from microsoft edge you thought that might be the issue we shut everything down we watched google chrome we logged into google chrome and when the report wasn't exporting out of cure m d and you weren't able to locate it you brought up my system performance and that's when you said oh well your system hasn't been restarted in so many hours and we restarted it nothing was working you submitted the ticket and then as soon as i went in to go try and print stuff that's when all the crashing started to occurs when we got off the phone right well something uh something is going wrong into the system let's say i am gonna disconnect this one here and i'm gonna send you the request again for any desk i have uh i have one already its two 68541 are you gonna do a different one no i'm gonna send you the request again just cancel this one and resend the request did you send it through email no no the same through through any desk i still see the same number i don't know if that's yours or not uh can you close any desk on your end and reopen it okay so i i shut the browser down i'm gonna go back to google chrome alright okay okay so now it's at the google web page so just open up any desk now you want me to download it sure so i still have the same number the (268) 541 293 hm i'm sending you the request okay i can just i'm gonna take control of the computer i'm just gonna minimize everything here i'm gonna close it okay i'm just gonna test try to print it and see if it prints out let me know when the system gives you a print out it's not my system's crashing i have a blue screen that says your pc run into a problem and needs to restart oh so uh as soon as i hit print you have a blue screen appeared and it says that your pc is crashing well it's being forced to restart due to an error that has occurred and i get the same error message every time so now my my computer has shut off it's restarting and now it's going back to the very beginning of the log in screen well that's that's very strange well that's what i said we so so we only just restarted your computer because it was not restarted in 73 days so i you know just uh restarted the computer that's it but for some reason now it is uh taking you for their and it's only happening when you're printing it right but it doesn't matter what i print and my google email is not there's something changed with my google email it doesn't even it doesn't even look the same formatting is all changed and we didn't do anything with my email so something in the restart of the computer because i haven't been able to do anything since all that occurred i haven't done anything with my computer right do you have an i t guy around here in your in your no not no we i would have to call him to to come in right uh so because it seems to be something in into the computer uh there was something which is going wrong with the computer uh and particularly it seems to be with the printer itself so uh we would have to get it checked by your it guy because you know each time i'm gonna get connected there as soon as it trashes we would have to redo it all over again uh so your it guy uh would would be able to take a look at your computer to see what exactly is going on what what's what's the matter with the printing i guess what i'm trying to figure out is what else was done on the computer for it to have for it to be this way because i guess what i'm saying is that because we were logged in with you on my system through any desk that's the last time anything effectively work because i went to go print something out after you we disconnected our call and that's the first time that it crashed literally right after we got off the phone so the restart of the computer whatever was done seems to be the issue of causing it so how do i go back to the way that it was so that my computer will stop doing whatever it's doing right well that needs to be actually looking to by the it guy because at times what happens is that you know to doubt uh updates or the changes into the system they're you know they're they're they have taken place but only the system needs to be restarted for that and uh you know the computer was not restarted for three days so it was like uh you know the the changes took place there probably and the changes which took place that's actually for now uh bringing in something either it could be uh uh you know a software which is uh you know which which needs to be taken care of which needs to be looked into uh but you know i could maybe take a look at that but it it's you know it's it just shuts down on my end as well we get disconnected so i know but here's my point then this didn't happen until you restarted my computer nothing was wrong with my system until you said oh it needs to be restarted because it wasn't crashing prior to that so this is all since we did the restart i wasn't having any issues i mean i've been fine i've been printing all day you know documents that we've needed for work patients whatever the case may be it's only since we did the restart right i totally i understand but you know restarting normally uh you know does not do nothing like that i mean you know restarting computer is like rebooting the system and clearing all the temporary memory and everything the way you're you know shut down the computer it's only now shutting down the computer i i i told you then as well that you know shutting down the computer is like you know sending it to slave and just you know uh like uh signing out of your computer but the system keeps going on you know in the background whereas when you restart your computer it just reboots everything restarts off everything so uh you know most of the time if you download the software it tells you to restart your computer because it needs to take place only that can do as soon as you read it so i'm only assuming that there was something uh which was downloaded and was taking place it's only it was for to restart and now it's just taking place and that is actually causing something which once again i i i can investigate but it just you know disconnect so we we uh you know either again speak to your it guy or i can have my it guy as well uh you know take a look into your computer on monday and uh what we can see what exactly went wrong what what what what exactly is causing this on to your computer is the application itself cure m d or the reports that is uh you know that that is just a stand alone thing i mean that that's just you just run it onto the browser so that is not a problem when you're printing it out as you know you you're able to do everything on the on the application it's only with the printing so i'm assuming that either it's the printing software itself or uh maybe we can you know reinstall the software try that and that would work but we need to take a look into that one so uh if if you have a an i t guy on site with you so that that would be really good okay we're not getting anywhere all right i will uh reach out to my it guys and see if you can fix it yes uh in time on monday you can definitely reach out to us and we can take a look uh if just in case if it's still the problem but i hope i'm i'm sure your it guy he'll be able to figure it out restarting your computer uh will do no harm to your computer it's something you know some software into the system okay alright thank you not a problem"}}, {"id": 906, "data": {"call_id": "1621971867.1057544.txt", "text": "san diego oncology hey this is peter from curemd may i speak with

office of doctor rosa navarro if this is a life threatening emergency please hang up and dial 911 or go to the nearest emergency room if you need to reach the operator you can dial 101 at any time if you are a physician or hospital trying to reach dr navarro please dial 101 or leave a message and we will return your call as soon as possible hi this is carmen hi this is brian from cure m d hi brian um so something came up right now with uh let me see um with the texting again back to that um that we revised it and edited but now it's um because doctor navarra wanted me to edit something on the message and then it comes out and read on top text message will be delivered in two billable messages so do you know what that would be is it are we being charged again where i'm asking because uh we need to know why does it say billable messages if if it's part of the it's actually a paid service so um now is this billable messages is like why would it show that it would say one or 2 billable messages right yeah on this particular one it says two on the other one we only have two um and the other one says 1 to two what does that mean well that means that uh the message that you're sending if if the text of the message would be long it's gonna be more than one or two messages it's gonna be showing you that text i mean and also it has um flags in it well that means that once you put a flag for instance the providers first name flag so it would pull the providers first name from the database now um the information that is gonna be pulled from the flags is could could be different could be one word or could be five words right so that could that could uh create a variation in the number of letters yes so that's the mhm that i understand but why does it say uh text message will be delivered in two billable messages i just wanna make sure that we're not being billed for it because it's a feature inside the cure m d yeah that's a premium service uh if you have this active that means that you already are paying for this i mean you you pay and you buy this right you've already done that doctor was here standing next to me and we saw that is that oh god so we just wanna make sure it's not billable okay alright and another thing could you could you connect with uh uh if you could check with doctor navarro that um uh there was a there was a ticket that she logged yesterday about an error message that is now taken care of could you please confirm that uh let me see she's with a patient but i'll let her know error do you know what the error message was for it was error 404 okay alright i'll let her know perfect um okay we'll see how this works i'm just hoping that you know just up from experience before anytime something is different we get billed for it i just wanna make sure that we don't because it's a nice feature but if we have to pay extra then we don't need it well also i would i would suggest you to uh give me one quick moment let me see if you can uh send an email on this so we should you send that email to um you could take um just give me one moment in the meanwhile uh for for this question i mean you can you can have it documented and the direct department could could actually uh guide you on this i mean how you're paying and what you're paying well it's not a question of what what we're paying i just i just wanna make sure that whatever we did is not going to get billed since it's part of the premium service that that's correct but to be to be honest i mean uh i would recommend if you if you talk to someone in the premium services so that they can uh tell you exactly what it is just give me one moment in the meanwhile if you could by any chance check with the doctor if the issues is fixed i would i would go and close

trying to find out how to maneuver to cure m d um just f y i oh my gosh and my mouse is not working just whenever you shift onto a new application it takes you know some time to get used to that can i take control this it's okay yeah go ahead yeah hey how do i get the mouse is not working or it just has to be charged more uh the mouse okay so i have the patient what is the name of the patient can you open the patient account from here uh i can search for the patients from here um this is this is who i'm looking for hold on let me let me check oh yeah i'll do it by last name let me go her okay and you landed patient account you go to the billing section drop down the billing section please okay okay dropped out to the billing section right here where it says billing right here see yeah right there yep let me just write that down click the plus sign click the plus sign okay and then you're gonna click on she has a bunch of claims out there that have been denied payments see them now if you know the that i know what's wrong with them if you know the specific data service for which you want to locate the e r a for you just click on that date of service from this section the payment section if not we can just search with her first and last name if you click on can i see it when you click on one and and see um the ticket to the e o b just wanna click on for example let's take this one because see this is the only one that is filed all these ones are still in charge that means they are not filed yet so we'll take this one as in file as they haven't been billed right file means they have been billed to the insurance okay wait wait filed i have not to insurance okay so we're in there we're in that claim for oh that's the date and balance 5000 okay so you got in there right now by the way this is part of our billing training did you join the practice recently no we didn't we had a couple of issues and with some people and so now we're kind of left on our own trying to trying to maneuver how to do all this because uh our billing training would cover all this every every part of this in detail because it seems these are simple workflows it seems that you're not working on billing before right i mean i've done billing in the past i've just never done this on curemd i mean i'm sure yeah yeah yeah like when when is the next billing training thing billing training is i can uh refer you to the relevant team the sales team uh they will look into your account see if there are any billing hours available on your account at the moment if not there is a pay fee i think it's 375 dollars how much three hundred and seventy five dollars they comprise of five billing section of five training sections uh comp containing covering each and every section of the billing covering each and every session of billing okay because then i can tell my boss yeah okay so it's uh it's a billing training if it's not in there um well you said you were gonna transfer me to see if if we had it or not but if we don't it's three hundred and seventy five dollars for 5 training sessions covering each and every session billing um how long are these training session just so i know most probably i think each section is it it is normally one hour but it didn't on the person getting trained because you know understanding how does he or she on how to do it any issues yeah mostly the maximum it takes us like 1.5 hour not more than 1.5 hour is more than enough for each training session and now is this one on one it can be it can be more than one person it can be more than one person it is not like you know if you pay for the billing sec like i mean the teacher is there gonna be like on is there gonna be a teacher on there like or is it gonna be like no no no it's gonna be a person from curemd who will be training for each model module of the billing billing okay so it's awesome and of course videos of those trainings as well just for the future if you need any help you can refer to those videos okay so and then um you said you were gonna refer me to the person to see if it was on the thing or yes because some of the practices because you when whenever a practice uh signed on to curemd they uh we actually offer specific hours of training to them so if those hours are expired i don't know how many hours thats not my department uh if those hours are expired only then you have to pay for the billing training otherwise it's free if those hours are not expired yeah yeah so cool so let's find out what's going on with that thank you i appreciate your help so in the meanwhile i'll show you how you can look at the  e r a here by the way yeah that'd be great for example you just copy this fire you go into the payment section click on the appointment date you will land on this right page here okay copy the claim identifier so you went from billing to payment and then we put in the patient and then you said the where would i find the e o b at down there below we went to the patient account then to the billing in the patient account from the billing from the billing from the pay yeah from the billing to the payments yep yep and then it just showed up right here like this you no when you click on the payment it will show you all the services you just click on i will simply click on the service for which i wanted to get the details for and after i clicked the uh date of service scroll down and copy this claim identifier okay this is the claim identifier for the claim that was filed recently for this particular date of service for this patient okay okay so because there are a couple of copying the claim identifier because there's a couple of ways to search uh for the e o b we're gonna put in that claim identity we are a claim identifier we can also search with the patient name i we prefer a claim identify because that will give you the exact e r a for that specific uh date of service okay okay cool so now that and then i have another question um i know right now off the bat that they're not covering for our cademine um injection because it's injection right is it an american can i just take off the drugs from the claim and and bill for just five or this is a separate question not to you uh this is not a separate question of course we can once the claim has been filed to the insurance sent to the insurance yeah you can delete anything from the claim all you can do is you can mark that code as inactive for example if you go to the charge page charge page okay see the little plus right next to the uh cpt codes yeah yeah let me just expand it it will give all the details right here and see this active check box yeah you're gonna uncheck that uncheck it save it it will mark that code as inactive if they're not paying for that if you want because you cannot delete it if you have already filed this claim to the insurance okay and then then we're gonna put that as inactive yes now yeah most of moving back now how did you get there can can you show me how you got there one more time you went to okay went to the patient billing patient and then to get to that it showed up all the patients and then we clicked on one of oh go ahead so what are we talking about are we talking about the e r a or to delete that j well both but right now to delete that j 0349 you clicked on one of the dates right of the patient of their claim like on one of like on 212 2021 or whatever charges okay so you want to charge is not paying charges click click on the specific date of service you you want to work with okay it will take you to the charge page and from there you can inactivate it and from there i can go down and do that plus minus sign and then put not active not active now why do you have to now even though you you did that billed like that i can't just where where would i be able to put the correct claim because i know i'll put it like on box 19 right is this this information is part of the training can we finish the e r a thing and this yeah yeah yeah it's covered in the training okay okay now since we copied the uh claim identifire we go to this claim section okay okay this is called the claims module the small come there see these remittances advice section you expand this yeah yeah remittance advice i see it yeah click on the remittance okay now in order to identify yeah in order to search we first of all select the search criteria since we have the claim identifier we select the claim identifire here now this is just a pending bucket okay pending means all the eras that have not been posted yet oh okay okay yes this is the e r a for the patient for that particular date of service awesome okay but if you want to you know get uh all the e r as more e r as you can select the last name or the first name of the patient put in the last name or the first name in this section and search system will give you all the e r as that is in pending section of okay yeah i remember starting to come a little bit more claim identified um now i got another question in that you know training sessions and stuff is it gonna pull me is it gonna show me how to pull the reports for like what's out there that need to be billed what's denied me yeah all that it will give you uh for the uh training for charge creation for the reports for the payment posting for the e r a posting for the batch posting and the last section would be the uh uh evaluation sort of uh section in which if you have any questions any confusions you can uh ask okay sounds like a plan thank you so much and then uh that to see if i still have to pay for that training sessions yes but it is it is yes it is quite a detailed training session it will really help you plus you know you will get the videos i need those yeah you will the videos of those training session because you know you're using of working on curemd and if you have any confusion anything you can always open the video and you'll be able to work no i need that video yeah so so now you're gonna reverse to the person that will let us i hopefully have hours on it then they don't have to pay for that would be great yeah hopefully yeah i'm right here can i take your name again please oh yeah michael mhm and uh your call back number is hold on they just changed the number 1 second okay it's 520809 yep 11 79 perfect

messages that are saying contact alright give me one moment thank you so it's the dermaology center dermatology laser and surgery of carnegie hill can i please put you on a brief hold alright thank you for staying on the line hello yeah hi yep you said you were facing issue while taking the eligibility uh yeah it's telling me to contact you all right so uh could you please provide me any patients account number like is it with uh some particular insurances or with you know every insurance there's one that's oxford one that let me see what hold on this one is oxford the last 1 hold on um sorry no problem what's that now all right the second one etna is that now and do you have the patients uh account number or any details i just wanted to hold on hold on hold on alright okay the first account number which on this patient swears the right insurance number and they just used it is 2046 that's their account number ella wilson yes alright give me one moment there was supposed to be hold on alright so for ella at the etna insurance is working the only reason you were not able to check the insurance eligibility is because the patient well i just run the eligibility with the patient's name and the date of birth and it's working and how come i'm getting i guess if you look at your chart you can see the e r s i got it and i can check it right now is it possible if you can share the screen or if you can just run the eligibility one more time sure i will run it again alright oh this time it's working okay great yep i don't know what okay so maybe the same thing will happen with this next okay hold on one second bear with me was okay so this one is the oxford one and it is account number 1988 marco marco haydeck one moment alright and this one is for tomorrow's tomorrow's date of appointment they both are yeah yeah so let me just check the details alright so this one is also working but it's working under a different policy number so what i did is that uh when i tried to run the eligibility i just changed the criteria just to you know check if there is any other possible member id so under this number id it's not working but when you go for the inquiry and you will select the search criteria patient's name and date of birth under the date and when you inquired it will give you so then again i don't understand what you're saying when i go into the the patient's name and demographics everything is fine the only thing is that the patients policy number that we have 9110611107 it seems like it's not the correct one i cannot confirm you that but this is what it is showing because i checked with the number it was not giving any details then i just changed the criteria search criteria i just change it to the patient's name and date of birth sometimes the insurances gives you a you know an option to go with the name and the date of birth and if there's any possible you know details in their database they just provide the details so when you now so so what you're saying is is (776 639 58,400 is the correct id well again i cannot confirm you this is what the insurance databases showing that they have with the patient's name under this name and date of birth the best thing that i can suggest you if you can contact the patient or check with the insurance but as far as the concern with the application there is no issue with the application or the eligible is working fine okay great thank you you're welcome is there anything else i can help you with okay um no it should be alright perfect thank you very much"}}, {"id": 916,

i'm pulling for the month of may so i'm doing may one through may 31st and then all i ever put is i click on the box that says show search criteria on report header and then i hit print and so that's when the crystal decisions all of that pops up so i was this was all day yesterday too and i thought well maybe there's just a clip so i'll let it go so then i went back in and i said well maybe it's trinity so i left my parameter i chose location charleston left provider all and then i left um resource off and i left the date alone and then i hit it again and then it just does the same thing okay

on my computer and it's doing the exact same thing hers is i just now was trying it did you try on internet explorer sherry yeah yeah and um i have not tried it on chrome mhm well i did it worked uh let me check my in transfer over here real quick definitely it will be reproducing for sure something that i'll have to report to my development team but as an alternative just to keep you guys up and running um you may use the other browser for now if that's okay can you check it on chrome yeah i am trying hang on one second i'm just pulling up i don't normally have it on chrome just because it does not it prints my cms forms really weird um so i don't normally have it on chrome um that's the main reason why i don't have it on chrome um let me let me pull it up in chrome and see if it works

"1622561920.1206286.txt", "text": "hello hello this is ben fisher calling from cure m d am i speaking with zoya yeah how uh hi ben this is zoya hi this is in regards to the ticket i received from you saying that you wanted to see if there is a very flow where the uh you know unless the notice signed the super bill may not be created so actually that's you know even if it's super bill uh i mean you know if if a note unsigned the super bill can anyway be created however uh you know if the super bill uh there there are some updates in the provider note so the super bill should be created the last so that every information which is on the note carries forward onto the super bill but there is no prerequisites can be uh made mandatory where unless it notice uh uh you know signed to the super bowl cannot be created but anyway it shows onto the super bill mentioning that the soup the note is unsigned so that you may know that the notice staying unsigned if the super bill is being created so before that if there is a prerequisite so you know the the note must be signed it does say on the super bill yeah it does say but um up until now some providers they create the super the super bill but uh the note is still unsigned alright so so yeah so doctor medvedowsky he wanted to avoid that because uh that create a problem for the billing so um he wanted um that option to be implemented that um the providers can only create the super bill um only if the note is signed so you they wouldn't be able to create a super bill without the note uh being unsigned well the way to do that actually uh because uh you know how it works is that this note can be signed and it could be unsigned and then the super bowl can be signed and un you know it cannot be unsigned but you know if it's super billy staying in draft state that can be deleted so you know so if we somehow add this feature that uh once the note is signed after that the super bill should be created so after that if the super bill is created unless the super bill is deleted you know you will not be able to unsign the the note and that happens a lot of times that you would have to unsigned the note and updated so that you know why we we do not have this work flow there is because a lot of times the note needs to be unsigned if we keep this as a pre you know pre rec for the note the super bill to be created you will not be able to make any changes to do uh you know i see okay i'll talk to him then the best thing right so the the you know the doctors need to understand the workflow which is why we have a notification on the super bill saying in red that so yeah i understand yeah i understand but you know somehow some providers you know they like um keep that uh that notification and you know they still submit the e super bill and the note is still unsigned and then uh somehow there is um that are like the situation so when they don't come back and they don't find so that's that's why he wanted me to get you implemented that thing for you know it's signed once and forever and the notes and then soup herbalism created but that's the reason even if you know take a look into that one so you know a lot of times even if the super bowl is signed though it cannot be unsigned but the note can anyway be unsigned and more additions can be made to the note because you know provider note something which you know a lot of time just so happens that so many times you you must know that that you know yeah so otherwise otherwise you know if you implement that thing you know the the providers wouldn't be able to un sign the note you got it all right to get that is right i got it okay okay then all right just send me the update on my email and i will uh delivered to doctor medvedovsky and then we'll take it from there okay alright so i'm gonna go ahead and close the ticket anything else i could help you with yes okay alright thank you so much thank you you too bye

you're able to sign it now yes it did let me do it i don't know what the thing was but uh you know things happen like there was an update so i was like well any time there's an update letting us now uh it's fixed now and you must be able to uh you know sign all the super bills and save them successfully alright thank you okay and then um i just i was just responded back i was responding back to you anyway so yes it does work so at least that'll help um but like i had a i think you guys were looking in before the secondaries insurance weren't attaching to our medicare claims for some reason through the oncology module only it's only strictly the oncology module claims and i was told that it was fixed but it's still happening where it's not picking up secondary insurance when i go to create the claims um i remember i was told it was because they're scheduling people through the oncology module and something needed to be fixed and then it was fixed but we've never scheduled any patients for oncology module period our front office doesn't know how to use the oncology module they only use the scheduler on the ehr side i still have instances when i'm trying to like create my charges i have to make sure that the secondary is attaching because it'll show medicare on the claim but it'll be blank for the secondary and then when the payment hits it transfers the 20% of the patients instead of transferring it to the secondary i understand but do you have any examples of some patients um i sent you one and then i have to look through all the other emails because i was told a couple of weeks ago it was supposed to be fixed but it's still happening well uh it was uh you know let me see when was this face it was just you know a few days ago and then there was an update and then and then it unfixed it i don't know i'm just saying no problem just give me a minute i can see ellen forwarded you the whole list of every thing uh which was updated there and that was the part of that one actually i am trying to find out that email here yeah but i just created one for 61 which was yesterday actually did 2 one of them i manually just did myself but i created i've been and not just 61 because i'm back dating from i'm billing from 5 18 current but even like my 61 claims which are from yesterday when i go to create the charge the medicare shows on on there but the secondary is not picking up so i have to manually select the secondary otherwise like i said it flips the patient statements may go out you never know things happen right well i uh if you get to experience this again do share your example you have my email address is you know i just sent it to you okay because i'm billing today and it's happening on multiple accounts where it's not picking up the secondary but they were saying it was because of the way that they're scheduled through oncology module but i'm letting you know our practices not schedule anything through the oncology module they don't know how to touch it they don't know how to use it they're not they're not scheduling patients they're they're scheduling them on the ehr side on the infusion uh resource schedule really okay well actually uh when we like really i know you train them but it's front office staff the nurses don't make appointments in front office don't know how to do it so even anna like just i just reconfirmed and said hey you guys aren't using the oncology module right they're like no we've never used oncology module to schedule an appointment period never they only use the scheduler on the ehr side which there is an m a book and there is a re they're both resource scheduled there's an infusion and then m a for each facility just like there's you know doctor shay doctor holand doctor lashkari sorry um so that's where the staff is making the appointments for that whether it's the front office staff or whoever they've never once made an appointment through oncology even trained them they never opened the oncology module they're never in there sure i'm gonna take a look into the one example you sent me i'm gonna work on it however uh you know as we investigated we found out that this was only happening for the appointments which were being created from oncology module which was already face but if you're saying that uh this was a patient so i'm only afraid that there could be a possibility that this one appointment was created from model but that has to be confirmed from the back end team so i'm gonna uh well anna wrote back that appointments for injections infusions are made in cure md not the oncology module and then the person who schedules all the infusions for tarzana she just said i never scheduled to oncology module i didn't even know that was possible so um our staff doesn't know how to use it i guarantee you they're they're not scheduling through there don't worry i'm i'm an investigate on it we'll see where where exactly was uh the appointment created from and even if it is it was created from oncology module from from that day onwards for the update has been done uh you know there won't be no problem even if they are created from oncology module or the the wait and decide however the problem would be maybe for the appointments which already created and i'm gonna work on this one which uh to see where this one created from and why did it not pick up the secondary uh insurance okay alright thank you okay i'm just trying to make things work you know i know i told you know how much work we got so i'm just trying to changing the diagnosis

you're on cure md and on the left hand side it shows you the calendar dates and you can click each box and see which appointment is there for that day so i just wasn't sure if there's a way where you

seven or eight or nine or 10 to 11 that's what you're saying basically how would i be able to see the first availability without having to click through each day like i just wanted to know if there was a way uh well actually uh there there there can be two ways now whichever suits you best i'm gonna take you to today's patients here you see this uh you can take a look at the today's patients which uh you know the patients are already checked in will appear over here so let's say i'm taking you today over here at this location we are and then we're gonna select the providers here we already have and let's hit search so there is no patient who is already checked in for the day i'm gonna take you back and maybe on friday you had any you want to use the system alright there you go so now these patients you have over here and you can see when is their appointment time so whatever is the doctors time to see them you know i mean like let's say doctor comes in the morning from 8 to 5 so you know you can you can see that uh what time slot is already booked for each patient and rest would of course be available otherwise what you can do is you can go to the calendar here and onto the calendar now for every day the uh you know the the the slots which are available so let's say let's talk about uh you know 10th or let's talk about seven here now all these appointments which are you know available from two onwards until five these appointments are actually uh you know available and they are they're already booked now you can see that let's say if there are four patients booked here it apparently means that the you know and and if there are five slots per day so it will mean that there is one slot available now you won't be able to see the time only you can click on there and take a look otherwise you can take a look at the weekly calendar here that gives you the information about the whole week when is the appointment of what patient and what slots are available so let me bring in the schedule here i'm gonna select location and then select the provider president maybe alright there we go now this shows us the calendar all through the week and you will have to you know scroll through the appointments you can just you know uh scroll through the page and you can take a look here oh that's really cool so uh great thank you not a problem second concern of yours where you mentioned that when the patients are checking in they are not getting the option to check the box for what type of card they're using and what uh is there uh you know their their name it doesn't pop up with their name so now do you have a test patient who you can check it for through kiosk um yes just give me one second so i can grab the ipad do you mind just holding one second hi so i'm just gonna go ahead and um book the test patient right now well i have already booked a patient account number four uh you can let me tell you the ah patients date of birth is (010) 120 08 01010 and the patient phone number is (954) 850 4099 okay perfect perfect is any of these two consent forms mandatory or they're all optional they are um mandatory they're both mandatory yeah okay well i'm trying to take them both for mandatory but it's not letting me do that which i'm going to discuss with the product team uh however i'm i'm i'm gonna you know update the system as soon as we get the update about that and we'll be able to make it mandatory uh however you know the consent forms have been updated and now the patients will be able to put in their name and select the type of the card okay sounds good thank you so much not a problem i'm gonna go ahead and close both the tickets anything else i can assist you with for now um no that's it thank you you're welcome have a great day goodbye"}}, {"id": 936, "data": {"call_id": "1622833457.1312065.txt", "text": "hello hello this is ben fisher calling from curemd am i speaking with darren chase speaking yeah hi doctor i'm sorry i was on the other line that time so i received this ticket actually and that says that the notes are not getting linked to the case uh what are you calling in this regard yes i was there was one note that i wasn't do you know what the what was i think in my head uh actually the ticket created by seth uh that does not say it so i'm not sure patients i don't have a case number on it uh i don't see a case number let me see if it's in the notes uh no there is no case number mentioned there when did you see the patient it was last week um i can't remember i have to go through my schedule give me 1 second mm yeah so it is case number if you're gonna be the account number of innovation yeah yeah give me 1 second 5834 thank you doctor patients name is cons compton yes alright okay let me go to the provider notes here there is a provider was created let's see here i need a data service for wednesday may 26 on the calendar it still says for me to do my note just bear with me i'm trying to check something here real quick no problem thank you thank you doctor well i can see who we're here actually that uh there were uh for the case which is low back uh it was uh actually created and i can see that uh the three notes are associated to that case the three notes which were one that was the last one which was done today the one before that was uh two days prior on july the second and before that it was on may the 26th right so they are associated to the case well how come on the calendar it says that it's not done it still still telling me to create a note onto the calendar tells you to create a note okay let me see that was for the visit that was on june the uh second right no may 26 may the 26th okay let me see just a minute please i'm checking something here thanks so i get it actually that appointment was created before the case was created that is why it shows you to create a note so uh so actually the case was created later on and the appointment was created prior to that so that's why it tells you to create the note but uh i i can see that the notes are associated and uh let me check something there as well i'm i'm just checking one last thing over here just bear with me please mhm okay thank you please hold a doctor so uh can we do a remote session on your computer through anydesk yeah we can do that give me 1 second though so take your time mhm okay alright let me know when you have the number for anydesk yep i got 745 033998 thank you doctor i'm sending you the request please accept it once you receive it okay alright i can see the screen it's perfect and uh i'm gonna take control of the computer i'm gonna take you to the test patient alright so actually uh you see over here what uh under cases where did it go hold on let me take over case review oh yes here it is okay thank you so i this is the case which i just tested you know creating i'm gonna delete it right now and uh i created an appointment for this patient here on uh i'm gonna take you to the daily view okay so i i created this appointment here and i take the space and then since there is no case over there so it gives you an option to create the case so you know you go ahead and create a case that's that's what you do i'm sure and i'm just gonna add a test case here and i'm gonna hit save and now if i go back to the calendar and now if i click on the name of the patient it gives me an option to create note so is this not what happened for this patient no what happened for this patient is when the patient came in the front desk get the zip code or something so they could not check them in and so i had to do the note differently i went to patient demographics and i went to provider note and that's how i created this note and then when you go to the note usually when this happens you just go up here this little box and i'll say snow but it's already linked so i don't know why it's still showing that that for me to create a note okay don't don't do that right now let me go back that's right we can un sign it again i want to test something can here i'm gonna sign it for you we're going to unlink disappointment that's fine you can hit save alright now i'm gonna save here 225 change the date see where it says 64 this one yeah that's the note you're looking for it just keeps the date right because it apparently took today's date i'm gonna link the appointment here the appointment uh it was this one 10 20 yeah he's already paid the one with the status paid correct i'm gonna pick it up and i'm gonna save here okay now let's go back to the calendar hm okay there seems to be two appointments for this patient i am gonna see where is the second appointment for this patient okay sure so uh why why do you have two appointments any idea i have no idea mhm you're like one on the calendar right i'm only thinking that maybe let me see one last thing here 10 20 10:20 a.m. and the one we added what there was for 10 25 10 25 okay so there is actually another appointment there let's try to find a where exactly did that go the one which we are uh you know too that is not a visible but the one we are uh uh we are clicking on where it gives you to uh create note that's where uh you know this is not the appointment actually let me see uh huh well that's very strange it is there it is on on this day it is on this let me see if there's any other actually that was on this calendar okay and it's actually checked out 10 20 mm there is a copay in winds actually checked out i'm i'm sure it's it's too uh they uh you know i've taken a lot of time with yours already i'm gonna do a little more investigation on my end then and let me try to uh get some more information as much as i can on my end and i'll try to get back to you if not today what time do you leave today uh i'm actually already closed okay no problem i'll i'll try back on monday i'll try to get back to you on monday to find out where did that appointment this one for 10 20 the one which we have a task is 10 25 or what we can try is we can try one last thing here uh which is already paid actually that's that's the one which should be linked to this note but i am gonna you know oh sorry not this one uh we're gonna link this appointment from here and link the other one with is fish and this is a checked out once and if i'm gonna save here and if i'm gonna go to the calendar now it's not going to show me this option of create note you see this now it says it did note so actually uh you know there is an appointment which uh which says the status of paid and that is not visible somewhere on the way to find out where did that go why is it not that visible on this calendar so but but which one was the appointment which should it be linked to the one which has the status of paid or the one which we just linked now uh you know i don't know as long as my notes associated with this and the uh you know the accounts so that he paid that shows up on it mhm that's all that really matters yes so this you know now this appointment over here is associated to the correct note and uh now if you click on here it tells you did note and if we go there this note is attached to the correct appointment i really need to find out where is that appointment but if you're fine with this one that it it it you know the appointment needs to be linked to the correct note that's all what you are looking for right so this is now linked to the correct note which is uh for you know over here and uh but but the status is checked out so the other appointment is probably other consumed elsewhere or for some reason it's not visible but the payment is there already so there is no no problem with that because it appears over here under here appointments if you go to the status it shows the advances of 100 and $25 over here already so that's not a problem alright that will work thank you so much not a problem doctor anything else i can assist you okay bye bye bye"}},

is harry from cure md how are you good i am trying to investigate regarding this slowness is because our development team is looking into it so i called yesterday so someone did provide me some kind of information and i spoke with the development team today and they were able to identify two problems so the first slowness arises whenever you add a medication not prescribed but when you add a medication they are fixing on the uh they are working to optimize it okay he described it too because sometimes dr shakor can't do it when he hit prescribe they have already deployed that fixe okay but they will fix uh deploy the fix for the medication edition either tomorrow or day after tomorrow so that will be resolved as well the second issue that they pointed out is the cdss engine which is related to the clinic so i wanted to ask if your practice uses the clinical alerts a lot okay that explains my question so the alerts are just notifications lets say if you want a patient to come up after one year so if certain cpt code air patient chart the system will prompt you that this patient is due for another physical exam or an annual exam so you can set up clinical alerts like that but what development team has requested me to do is to ask the practice if they use the clinical alerts because they have seen the slowness within that module and they wont need to so they want me to disable clinical alerts for lets say a day or two just so they can observe and you guys can observe if there is any slowness as after disabling that module as well and if disabling clinical alerts fixes the slowness issue they will optimize that as well okay so i wanted to confirm if i can go ahead and disable the clinical alerts for a day or two yes because we dont know that i dont think we use that that is perfect and just to confirm no problem and just to confirm have you faced any slowness for today or are you still facing i havent yet today no you have not that seems like a promising answer then let me just verify if the clinical alerts are enabled yes they are so can you just give me the names of the users so i can go ahead and disable that service one by one for each user but if im going here on well if you go to add if you go to add medication is still slow but you said theyre working on that that is correct okay so the users in here are dr shakor mhm myself just 1 second let me pull up the user name so i can okay i mean i dont know i can type in i dont know i will just so its brenda adams maryn brooks yourself hannah stabler adnan shakoor ayesha shakoor hassaan shakoor elma shakoor and there are two user accounts for arif shakoor so im gonna go ahead with the clinical alerts for maybe a day or two and at the end of the day i will still give you a call to confirm if you have faced any sloweness okay okay alright thank you youre welcome martin take care bye bye you too"}}, {"id": 940, "data": {"call_id": "1620397633.7680109.txt", "text": "thank you for calling CureMD support this rick is how can i help you uh hey rick this is teresa saint john and um i need some help understanding a report and it's a time sheet report and my ticket number for that is 1583858 okay 1583858 yes okay let me just see who is assigned to so that i can transfer you to that person okay thank you youre welcome crowded room you find something lie hello and you six crowded room he said the annual is present alright uh sorry for the long hold uh we were just seeing who is assigned to your ticket but actually its in the queue right now so i may be able to help you out with that so what questions do you wanna ask you can please go ahead um i'm looking at the let me pull it up here where to get hang on um so i'm looking at the time sheet report um on a specific employee and oh hang on i'm sorry uh let me get one user one user come on okay got it okay so on her report this is timing in i'm assuming the timing is when she actually logged onto the system yes the first log in for the day to the CureMD okay time out it's it means that the last log out time for the day when she last logged out really now is that an automatic log out because the emr system times them out uh this is the last uh it means that this is the last instance of her log out means she must have logged out in the day like 5 to 6 times whenever she stepped out from the system or she was doing some other work but the the system takes it as the last instance of the day of that log out so if she logged out as she logged in at nine a.m. and she logged out at the last log out was at four p.m. and after that there's no log out then the system takes that last log out as the last log out of the day okay so we have a little problem child working with this right now and i'm looking at her log in nobody could find her this morning her time in today was 9:16 am her time out with 10:01 am okay okay so actually the she actually logged out from the application at 10:01 am so that's why it's giving you the time out as 10:01 so it gives you for the whole day until the end of the day so like it will give you the old details like she logged out at 10:01 but when she logs back in it will give us the time in time again so there will be another line exactly yes for today's date may 7 and if she logs back into the system yes there's another time in it will show timing at 10:02 am exactly it will show time in at 10:02 wow wow okay so let me ask you this um yesterday it shows time in 8:29 she logged in at 8:29 time out was 16.39 what does that mean uh 16.39 it means that it was at 4:39 4:39 p m okay so the day before it was time in 9:03 am time out 2:10 2:10 p.m. yes that's in the middle of the day oh my god and so if she had technically logged back in the system to work into CureMD it would have another time in date may fifth and her time back in exactly wow okay and then it has over here total okay let's let's go by the time in was 9:03 time out was 2:10 total hours were 17:07 what does that mean it means that five hours and seven okay so that's yeah it's like 24 hours time so that is that is giving you in 24 hour format so that's telling me she worked five hours and seven minutes that day exactly yes holy smokes wow wow wow unbelievable okay okay okay i'm just totally i'm yeah okay well wow okay well thank you i appreciate and what was your name my name is rick rick okay rick lord have mercy okay well explained i'm i'm just totally i just it's unbelievable but anyway all right thank you you're welcome take care teresa bye bye uhuh bye bye"}}, {"id": 941, "data":

good thank you hey um it's regarding your ticket claims not found just give me one quick moment i'm just opening up your practice bear with me please okay so you know what i'm talking about i called some of the pending claims um and i found out that the claim was not going through and then i had to resubmit it so do you want to take a look at it please one moment i'm looking into it bear with me do you want to go to anydesk or just tell you the name of the patient give me one moment anne okay thank you okay and now i'm ready for the anydesk you have the number for me okay okay let me log in hold on sure the number is 601 064 370 got you sending a request please accept okay now let me go to be okay yeah i hope i gave minimize i already resubmitted it but i didn't get it why it was not going through okay the do patients i had looked up today hold on please i think i changed it okay if you see the first one in a martin the insurances health first okay i'm going to show you the does uh uh 4 14 for can you look up this please sure um yeah sure annie um can you please confirm that i can see it's a healthy response plan team and the claim is under file status would actually mean it was already sent to the insurance so uh we're trying to look at no no that was sent because i resubmit it today when i looked up the payment i'll show you the payment section that's how i found out let me go to the payment section and there is something rejection or whatever it's saying i cannot make it out so i thought look at this there is only one out of here usually there are three arrows and where are the other okay hold on now at this point let me check why is it rejected it's a legitimate claims give me one moment okay so three times you have actually submitted this claim for 23 2021 is the first admission date and then you submit the okay you printed out today right did you submit on paper or it was rejected i found out it was rejected so i had to resubmitted sure so why i was rejected in history include i c d this review the record on this data service developed the claim diagnosis complete and accurate then resubmit the claim question call c h okay now we need to actually look at this specific icd code first which was actually being used with the patient claim how you can actually check that it's pretty easy let me show you i mean you should be in the system even if it is rejected and they they could not locate the claim and i called health first did you check the rejected bucket no i have a lot of them so i'm holding you know the coding should always immediately give me a signal if it is the wrong code it always shows me a red alert so i don't know whether that's the reason i understand give me one moment do you have chrome or any other browser because we usually recommend to use chrome um yeah i do that you know i have the um give me one moment let me check on my end okay that isn't mm that's weird the insurance i haven't concluded that yet but i'm just actually looking at the website first it's the rejection reason says uh that says the patient history includes icd this review the med racket on the state of service to validate the claim diagnosis are complete and accurate then we submit the claim so this was your rejected reason it is a um it's a coding issue and since we are not the authorized coders so we recommend our clients to contact the insurance so you can actually guys confirm or the quoting team to actually confirm what is the actual information they need on the um on this claim you can also call c o c h so i'm sorry it's c h c on this number which is given it um at this point it's extension three so you can call them but i'm just actually reviewing it first on my end bear with me please give me one morning i can change the coding but you know it never showed me a red alert that it is the wrong code usually when your code it is not the right code it always pops up and read and then i have to correct it right but the thing is at this point i can see this code is an active it's a valid code but maybe they required further information to adjudicated so this is the issue now i'm actually looking at it still give me one moment i'm actually open on my end if it actually appears on the rejected claim a note okay thank you you're welcome because um let me let me actually look at it because it's already submitted so i highly doubt it if it's wait wait it out and see what happens now yeah we can actually wait at this point because the specific um let me let me see that give me one moment maybe it's the cpt code the consult talking about 99254 is not it must be the cpt code you know this one this 19999254 it could be um but it all depends correct correct i usually use it for other claims so they not me you know it's not the wrong code absolutely they are the right code i understand that give me one moment i'm just looking at your rejected bucket well since it's already submitted and this is why it's out of the rejected bucket but it should be in your rejected bucket so there are multiple rejections there and i believe this is why you weren't able to find it first so if you go to your rejected but there are like 490 rejected but can you please get rid of them because of you know old ones they're all old ones okay so in that case what we will do is we will actually click on appointment at a load come on yeah so now they're done so 2007 11 let's go to the next page may can go to the last page as well but i would actually recommend to go to the first page and since they are now how do you delete them one by one in a page page by page how do you do that not actually actually you cannot delete them you can actually move them to the problem list now do you want to select records for all page you will select no because maybe you will have the uh latest rejections as well but i understand that like 2011 is a very old date so you can go page by page and click on add problem list in this way number correct they will be moved to the problem list and in the problem you will say uh old claims or i think best one is out of timely filing okay now click add and we'll see this will be added here and even if you want to assign it to yourself so it will be like this what do i have to do each one like that each page because of on each page you will have all the patients and in this way they will be actually move to the problem this and you will see fifteens are here in order to actually move them from the problem list as well so all you need to do is once every single old claim or out of timely filing claim will be appearing here so you can actually click on all the service from here and you can actually uh move to result so if you move them to the result after checking that because it um we recommend you should check these first if you if you think like they're all from the old dates and nothing can be done on this so you can simply select all of them and you can move them to resolve and this will actually allow you to remove this number appearing here so this is what you need to do you need to go to the rejected bucket right here and then you can simply arrange them like you have 2020 claims as well here i'm sure you that 2020 and then 2011 so click on the appointment first to rearrange them and then you can actually check the small box so this will allow you to select all all the pages as well but you need to click on note so you can go for page by page and then you click on problem list again and you will write down again out of tommy filing and say that's what you need to do i'm sorry uh you need to assign it to yourself you have the name on the top save it okay after saving it these old patients will move to the problem list now you will see 1330 are in the problem listed at this time do you have a question regarding this yes i was talking about another patient also which is past due time and even then that i found that they couldn't find it the problem is i don't know let me show you so you told me that this is resubmitted you can read it out right i'm really sorry i didn't get your question can you see that the one we were talking about you said since resubmitted i can wait it correct okay correent because there are too many rejections rejected bucket this is why you were actually facing a hard time to actually find them but if you have a rejection appearing here i can actually show you they must be in the rejected bucket as well so look at this so this is sending okay so can you find out the status what's happening with this now i resubmitted that too today okay so this will be in the payment we can actually go from the charge directly as well and we'll see that okay that was submitted as well if it was actually rejected so you won't be able to see it on your is it due to the same reason because the thing i'm getting why it was actually rejected no that's a different issue but it's coding again procedure code advisor provide a claim history identifying an outer then it cannot be because this is the same patients that come for the same problem so that's not a problem something else on your auntie you know that the curemd is not doing it because these are the current codes and valid codes have been using so it's not a question of course so you might i completely agree with you but annie um and you just give me one moment i'm going to put the call on a brief hold bear with me thank you you're welcome"}}, {"id": 947, "data": {"call_id": "1620391075.763844.txt", "text": "your call

program for the setting up the surgeries it's the surgery is running over another office kind of and so that's why and she is responsible for putting all the information in for the surgery and she can't get that program running and i don't know i i i mix it probably up but that was the issue why she had the trump between the two browsers so these other words you you have set up now for her and

and thank you this is sam how can i help you good morning sam this is kurt from curemd how are you today good how are you very well thank you uh i did call you earlier in the day maybe in the later in the day you called me but uh i'm afraid i was busy with another clients so i try to reach you this morning uh so we did get the uh report functionality tweaked a bit i would say and now it should not show any kind of uh duplicates like the last time uh i was recommending the billing summary we came across the discrepancy of duplication uh such as uh we did have one patient in question can you remind me which report this absolutely no problem one second no problem okay i'm under report yes and i'd like you to expand miscellaneous on the left hand side and then go on and then go on to billing summary okay yeah over here i have it open here excellent you have the search criteria so if you remember on the search criteria we were going with specific provider like muhammad hussein and uh and you put it in a date of service maybe that was uh just for the first two months of this year january and february uh you can just key in january for now because just for trial purposes i'd like you to uh maybe remind you of what was going on and why this was uh being reconsidered on our side so it was uh once the results come up come up if you just select uh a month date range such as the months january january yeah so uh once the results come up there was a one uh example discrepancy that we were able to catch which was uh carolyn chandler one of the patients carolyn chandler where uh one c p t was utilized only once for the date january 1st 2021 but it was showing as two lines duplicates there maybe that rings a bell yes yes i remember yes so carolyn it was showing two transactions at that time for uh one date of service when when we went to the charge page and saw that uh the charge page was the complete charge page was for two different dates of service but that one c p t was done only once on the first and on the report it was showing two entries like duplicates for that line level and uh that's what i what i had to get corrected for you in which we we are now able to so now if you run the report i'm very sure you should see just one entry for the example patients carolyn schindler uh having that that c p t done uh for one day only that's great yeah no problem so that's something i wanted to convey that uh we've reconfigured that uh the the team on our side and there was a logic specifically just to give you a specific logic of the report how it was functioning previously to how it's functioning now has been changed a bit okay alright so it should this is a c p t specific report uh anytime if you run it with a certain date range even if a charge page has multiple c p t s with multiple dates like 1st 2nd and the 3rd 3 3 procedures done on the 1st 2nd and the third then if you run it with one specific date it it will show you only that specific procedure because it's a line level it's a c p t based report so there are five codes done on the same day it will show all five if you run the the search criteria with the same date got it right but if you're if they're five cpt is done on five different dates and we have the search criteria of one date only it will show one record only okay alright sounds good very well anything else for now uh no that's it thank you no problem i did speak to uh one of uh maybe your representatives mahjbeen yesterday and uh yeah we discussed a bunch of reports so uh maybe if you want to get in touch with her if you're maybe playing around with reports so i did convey a bunch of reports that uh to her uh in regards to what was collected by a specific provider what money was made by specific providers in a certain date range and and uh the details of the report and comparisons and others and even outstanding reports were shared with uh deanna uh and and uh mahjbeen both in the past they maybe 10 to 15 days so you can get in touch with them and if you certainly certainly have more queries to punch in the support tickets and let us know okay alright thank you soo much you're welcome this weekend

your ticket that you want us to remove some of the charges from the rejected bucket yes sir well there are two ways to do it either uh the first way is the longest way that we can inform our uh reconfiguration team and they will configure your database and then these can be removed the other way the other way is that uh which i was actually trying to do that uh we can move the claims to the corrected bucket first and then you need to go into the patient's account click on the charges and simply click on print like uh the the print if you take the take the claims first into the corrected bucket and then take a hit print the the charge will disappear from the corrected bucket okay like i got printed out of the system on a hicfa yes but okay you won't be taking a print because when you click print it will show you a preview so you can go back okay okay so moved to the corrected bucket i've already moved some and i've already removed some i see that i see him in the corrected now okay are there so you can open up the patient's account right now i can tell you the date of service which you can do this procedure on okay uh which patient are you doing it the patient account the patient account number is 201114 springs ah got him okay are you going to the patient account yes sir i am in there okay uh go into the charges and then click on the appointment date uh 64 2019 at 9:40 p.m. got it okay then from top click on claim okay professional okay click print got it um are you seeing the preview now of the hicfa come back to the patient's charges okay so go back to edit add or edit charges or the search tab you can go to the claims module from top regardless oh let's let's check if uh the claim is going from the correct the bucket are you checking the correct bucket uh yes sir i don't see that data service in there anymore that is the shortest way to remove any claim from the rejected or correct okay alright so just make sure you move into the correct bucket the patient's account um like you're gonna print hicfa and uh that will remove it remove and there was another ticket like you have lost two tickets uh one was for sarah studor as well so you can um like i'm unable to find that patient in the rejected bucket oh she's not there anymore nice let me see it might be possible that someone has recently the claim electronically i guess oh it looks like somebody made a payment the medicaid came in and paid on it that's why that's great or the secondary yeah so that one is good so that is how you can remove the claims from the rejected bucket first

name is ryan calling on behalf of cure md support regarding a ticket that was locked in by jennifer hip uh would you mind knowing if she's in the office for the day this is her awesome perfect hey jennifer uh so uh jennifer i got your tickets tickets 374 oh 918 in which your patients werent getting any reminder emails most recent being jennifer gal gallon both now uh what i was able to figure out jennifer is that within your cure md practice uh the s m s alert feature that we provide is not active now that is an add on service that we do provide so if you do want to enable it for the future i can get in touch with finance i can give you what does that mean because some of our patients are getting email reminders and some are not so how is that possible that something is not activated and i dont want text message reminders i want the email oh email reminders i got that got that got that got that okay yeah yeah i was gonna i believe i misread that if that was an email okay uh let me try to see and you did mention that if you did get them in the past uh let me double check that its a good thing i have you on the call so im just gonna put you on a quick hold and ill get back to you just a moment jennifer okay thank you my pleasure not a problem hello im good how are you again do your screening questions have you or do you believe you've been exposed to the covid 19 the last 14 days are you experiencing any of the following shortness of breath cough severe throat no sore throat fever severe loss papers now um are you ready karen okay give us a holler when you are uh are you just seeing this smart alice hey jennifer uh thank you so much for staying on the line and being patient so i was just kind of figuring this out so i think uh i can definitely uh resolve this right here now so i just figured out a few steps but i personally want you to do uh any desk session with me and make those changes yourself and understand the work for your i have a patient that's why i put that first thing in the morning was the best time to call me to deal with this is this just something you can do because i have one here and one about to walk through two about to walk through the door so i cant do that now okay i understand uh honestly i just it would be great if we could do at any desk but i understand youre busy is it possible to maybe through out the day if you have a time slot available just probably 10-15 minutes maybe um no im busy all day thats why i put in the ticket that i needed to call first thing in the morning i could have done it first thing in the morning um it worked forever now suddenly its not can you just do whatever needs to be done for it to be working again yes okay so uh how about that you have to hold on you have to hold on good morning how are you hello yeah im not gonna be able to do this now yeah i completely understand actually i did make one change uh probably is there a way you can check if the one of the patients did get an email probably maybe just tell me how yeah uh basically when you schedule an appointment they do get that email of not missing the appointment but how about this i did make a change so through out the day when you do schedule appointments ill just update the ticket and if you can just reply via email to me to let me know hey yeah they are now receiving the emails on reminders so ill keep the ticket open ill just communicate you were you able to look into the patient name that i gave you to see if shes corrected the two at least yesterday that told me they werent getting reminders were both gmail accounts i dont know if that means anything yeah so uh actually jennifer but i was able to find out within your practice settings the email option on which sent out the email itself it was disabled for some i have no idea why it was but i enabled it for you so as of now uh any emails are being sent out when it comes to reminders so the next email that wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait so i had one person tell me they did get the emails okay yesterday and one person told me they didnt if it was disabled how come that one person got emails and that second person did not thats actually a very good question this is just what i was able to find out over here but maybe this isnt that little option that was not allowing it but what i will do is ill just look into jennifer right now i dont wanna take too much of your time jennifer because youre busy at the moment so ill just and just call it in a bit ill look into jennifer gallon bows user account by itself and see why its not going to her and ill keep the ticket open and ill contact you tomorrow since youre busy today but ill keep on communicating through the ticket okay just to see if this works okay thank you jennifer like 9 and 11 would be best tomorrow i will call you first thing in the morning ill keep on making changes ill look into jennifer i wont call you since youre busy but i will update the tickets so youll get an email so itll probably just be like hey jennifer i did this uh can you ask jennifer shes getting it or just to see how it works out or the day goes okay alright thank you my pleasure jennifer thank you for your time bye bye alright bye bye"}}, {"id": 981, "data": {"call_id": "1620404905.771567.txt", "text": "thank you for calling cure this is john uh can you speak with

it says um hold on one second let me just get off this page and then i'll tell you for sure change okay so you know where it says patient portal set up and on that first screen where you're kind of setting up the log in page yes it's a spot that says practice forms underneath the welcome note yup and so when i click to upload the documents that i have it's uploading the documents however it's not correct so i'll upload let's say i'll upload the the sheet for the with the registration sheet that wants their demographics like address and stuff right it's it's uploading a duplicate of the um history sheet like it's not uploading what i'm actually putting their it's creating something completely different that's weird do you want to do any desk to see what i'm talking about sure uh let me just pull it up one second okay and let me know when my four minutes is up and i'll try again just give me the number when you have it yeah no worries um let me just download that again 2997 22 290 can you see my screen i can see it okay i'm just minimize these okay so this is the screen i'm on in the patient portal set up and for practice forms so i will just show you a practice form so you could see what it what it actually looks like okay so this is one of our practice forms right if i'm gonna upload this okay so so it's uploaded right gonna go to our website to go to the patient portal so i click it to open it that one's giving me an error so this is the one so now one is giving me an error but that's not what it was doing before hold on one second okay let's choose okay so now it's on here we'll refresh this oh okay good to show that one now let's try to do a different one because before it wasn't showing it was showing the wrong one when i will upload the other one so that's the patient feel right let's do the agreement form oh apparently it's working on it just wanted it just wanted me to be stupid so let's see agreement form we want that one what and we wanted the registration form and i think that was the only ones i wanted let me double check i don't like okay okay so let's see if it's gonna work now i don't have all this stuff up so you see this isn't the history form mm i haven't actually seen the history form can you show it to me okay this is the history form but the electronic consent form i see so the i guess the would be to put the order gets messed up right i think that would be it so can we try another one like for example registration okay so this is what i was encountering this issue let me try to pull this all up on my end too because i think uh yeah the portal will be the same uh yep okay practice form okay patient fill a form history one coordination hip authorization registration form and electronic content okay electronic consent is okay email communication electronic consent like then we have registration okay just the same one alright um will you shoot um chelsea you shoot just a text message and ask her if she can reset path group thanks just because i'm on the phone so i don't know if i need to okay i can only yeah i only see one uploaded most of the time could i just uh copy the forms over that you need uh alright i'm just gonna let them this is one that you need coordination this is also one hip authorization history which else registration yes and these are about the same rate history one history on link ok you don't need to have both of them okay and uh what agreement form not that one the one that says blank next to it uh the one that says blank blank right here oh this one okay um uh i'm unable to all right there you go okay and then there and then hold on one second i think it's one more um electronic consent blank at the top consent like i think yeah this was worrse it wasn't opening at all they probably have to make this pdf okay let me just copy i think i have that as pdf um you can uncheck that you see where you have underneath um history blank history right there this is the that's the coordination of the pdf file but i don't know why it's got that little x on it so mhm okay i'll i'll check that out yeah i don't know what that even means okay here we are so okay even if the coordination of care isn't on there it's okay because we can get it in the consent forms the main ones i need is the history hippa patient feel and registration those are the main ones that i need because the other consent forms we can print those off from the patient's chart and have them sign i was just trying to make it a little easier for those people who are have like have technical difficulties in the portal wait a second the agreement form blank uh huh that's not pulling up let me try to copy it over again agreement form which one are you trying to copy over uh cream and form blank which is the correct one out of these two or this is the one that's the only one okay agreement form huh okay yeah that's the agreement that's the history that's the history the agreement again is okay yeah that's agreement i think that was already yeah that's agreement um and the registration uh for some reason i've been able to get it onto my computer oh it's there but it's just like it's not opening for some reason do you want me to email it to you yeah okay authorization that's good uh it would be josh dot green g r double e n e at cure md dot com construction history patient agreement i think those are the only ones that i really would like to be on there okay yeah mainly these are the ones that i would need to be on their history patient field um registration agreement and hip because anything else we could just print off so i'm gonna send those to you now okay what time are you supposed to be um what time is your your date what time are you supposed to be helping chelsea it is time you really would have to be like on time and you will have to be there like you gotta leave by like 12 why don't you do that tonight so then that way that's one less thing either that or your nails and stuff but i wouldn't suggest that if you move and stuff tomorrow so i would say maybe do your hair and stuff tonight and then tomorrow once you leave from her then go sit and get your nails and stuff done if you go about 12 it might be alright then you'll have again you have enough leeway so you have about four hours to play around in there and you got two to get home get ready i mean you might be late or maybe you can do your hair and your toes tonight and then just go get your nails your hands done tomorrow i mean but i wouldn't yeah yeah i feel like you know i wouldn't i would just if i wanna go i'm gonna knock it all out mhm let me go get my feet done so i can change my color but i think i wanna change my nail color again so did you get my email uh yeah i got the email just copy over the file okay cool i'll just make sure it came through hm the history and the registration look the same can you confirm on your end this is the history mhm this is the registration one second registration registration vs history uh huh when you emailed them to me why did they look completely different this is weird i don't know uh let's see uh which one which one because i got the email i'm pulling them up from the email uh the let's see the registration form looks like yeah it's looking just like the one that reads you know at the top email communication felt information fact sheet and consent form mhm that one is which one is that one okay wait a minute that was a wrong let me send you and this is what happens when i have all right so there's a registration i just sent and there let me send you the history alright that's the history form its blank and then the other one that i sent you that's actually the electronic communication form so don't worry about that one that was not important so the two new ones i just sent you an inpatient field agreement and hippa okay okay history mhm okay now i got the correct history one and registration yep i got it now okay and i'm gonna just take these off of here okay um okay so i just took those off for the package let's try this again it's blank follow notification field blank registration point we also needed the electronic consent form uh on the portal right um it can be it's not like the biggest deal in the world okay alright i believe that there then the hippa it's a unique one i'm just put it on there okay and then okay so let's see if it allows me to save it really giving me a hard time see now i didn't even save them on there so i don't know i don't know what happened i just added them i press save i'm i'm wondering if they're corrupt because i'm pulling them up sometimes i'm getting a correct result sometimes not okay now i think i got some unique once i got electronic patient fill hippa and agreement and they're each pulling up uniquely let's see agreement uh agreement agreement agreement where to go uh okay agreement here okay history okay history is pulling up correctly hip is pulling up correctly patient fill awesome electronic consent okay and the registration form okay that is also correct okay so i got 12345 which are absolutely correct and let's see which ones left do you have a hippa form mhm i got the hippa uh i think the agreement form is the only one that's not opening up if you could send that one to me again the agreement one okay well actually i just got it okay it's fine it's fine i got it agreement alright so we have agreement hippa history who is that other christmas patient not doesn't know people just be coming in here okay i got the five main forms correctly now the only thing that was missing is the one that was in word the ro i'm sorry don't worry about it it's okay okay now i'm gonna try to upload these from my side let's see if that works okay okay okay agreement history registration blank uh should i just remove blank from every one of them or should i leave the blank one there it's up to you i don't it doesn't make me a difference okay now let's see if that pulls up our correct forms uh going on with the portal refresh okay agreement form first thing uh nope i guess yeah there might be a problem it's just not pulling it up it's not pulling up at all or is pulling up the exact same thing yeah exact same thing that keeps pulling up the electronic consent forms even though that's not the one you uploaded right yep yeah that's the exact same problem that i was having even though i'm looking at it before i upload it and then upload it it still wasn't right yeah you're right about that let me either look into this or report it to our back and see if i can figure it out on on my end and i'll get back no worries you just let me know alright thanks thank you you too"}}, {"id": 986,

across uh okay uh was actually uh in a meeting earlier just give me one moment let me just check on my end no no worries it's actually on uh looks like the a session number is 14 maybe uh huh oh that's okay we can find out the event successful just let me log into the database so it's with a single o b x uh yes it looks to me i'm just logging in just one more minute you're good man no worries i didn't do this a little bit different um i did put it in as a preliminary to go make an adjustment on it and then i put it in as a final so you probably got initial message that came across with the p and o b r 25 you should have got one that has f so the final is sent already or is it being held up yeah it's already it's already left uh okay then it might have updated the partial with the final two well it's okay we can test that as well efficient was one test ah this time i do have the pdf but i have three procedures that's how this one is that's how this one is ordered there were three yeah i'm able to open the pdf as well i can download and send you an email so you can yeah because what they're doing is and that and then keep in mind these are templates that she had built in her old system that were put with a movement so it may depend on how they're doing it because they're they're billing software i think it's with you guys i'm not sure if that's independent piece but whenever they do their procedure on the report template if they attach all three procedure codes you'll receive all three just like you did on this one um but you only get one report uh well since we're not getting any text in the result and only the pdf is what we are getting i believe we should be good with it what are your views about it okay um i mean i think it's okay as long as you can get it in process because what they did on that on that report uh may open it up and take a look at it but she reports them together so it's like one it's one long report um for those pieces from what i understand that's i guess that's what she does that's how she builds them out so i'll confirm that with her and make sure uh but she would be the right person to let us and i have a i have a call with her today to make sure but um and if she puts no i mean do you have to have put a procedure code is that a requirement for you know it's not a requirement it's just that in the system when we expand the result i'm seeing 3 3 lines of procedures and three statuses which final so but the pdf is intact um i'm gonna send i'll send you a pdf just one quick moment i would like you to review it yeah yeah yeah i had to actually go in and increase the size of that segment because we a lot to like 65,000 um bites so i just increased to two mb and then i reprocess the earlier one that that i sent yesterday just to see if it went how it read in my system and it looked good so i was i was hoping it was was causing accordingly okay so that's good news so that's good news okay i've sent you the email alright i'll get it just please see once you see it yeah give me just a second here here we go up here and look at it as an exact match and you got two pages right uh yes first page stops with the um findings on the bottom of the last part and it picks up on the second page is there are no suspicious solid assistance messes in there yeah cool and also let me send you another screenshot of how the result is being displayed uh if you have a call the doctor where you can just you know confirm with her if that is not a problem with her if that is then they need to fix some workflow uh like you stated now because we cannot control it we have to display whatever we receive yeah and it could be so what what i did on this one just so you're gonna get a a process of what it looks like so when i when they put the order and obviously it comes across and we got the description but we did not get that i didn't get the code for that so i didn't i didn't get like an a p t when i got the description part i didn't get any kind of code so did you send anything across with that or no uh i did send a quote along with the description that was the test code exactly as you were you you had mentioned in that and then it didn't populate on my side with that uh with that code so i can tell you where we are sending it if that helps yeah tell me where it's at okay just let me just quickly go through the order i think it's o b r o b r 3.1 something let me just confirm okay so in this order okay i see it on that 4.1  okay okay yeah i see it well that's that's that is the study type code so i'll i'll probably you probably need the procedure code right no uh whatever you give us we can you know whatever companion you give us we will upload it it it's just your understanding with uh over like it's with the client it's not what i got i didn't get that though i didn't get the uh let me go back in the order here real quick 1234 .193925 i'm talking about the number yep i said that's it yeah so it looks like what's happening in there they did not should not give us the procedure code so i got the study type code but i have to have the procedure code on the back end and looks like she didn't they didn't put those in there that's what it is okay if you want the procedure code over here you will have to put it as a companion like the procedure code and the procedure name anyway i'll send you the whole thing yeah what i'll do is i'll i'll send you the entire thing that has a procedure code on there with it um so when you send it across with the a p t 108 in theory that should match up with what i have in my system and be a 1 to 1 match and then it would provide me the procedure code on my side which would then populate it into the report at the top there was one more thing in the email there was a space after a p t 108 but we cannot handle space in a test code can that be a reason yeah i can adjust those uh i have sent you without a space uh but you sent me with space in the email so and it came across accordingly so hang on just a second maybe it's on your end it's with the space that is why it's not matching yeah it does have a space in here but there's no procedure code tied to it on my side either right now it's uh the procedure code for that is is not filled in so i haven't got those yet all she gave me was study types sure so i'll uh i can close down that space that's not a big issue uh and then it should be fine even if it did have this have those spaces give have given me a procedure coke there's not one tied to it yet so that that's easy fix we'll take care of that but we've got messages flowing that is good yeah and if you talk to doctor grover you can simply tell her to look for one patient test and go to the receive results and you'll see the results of you if she wants to see it awesome okay i'll let these other two sit for a little bit and then if we have to make some i can use those for validation at that point if she wants to make adjustments so right now i think we're okay um and i'll give her an update today sure and one last thing that i'm just taking just give me one quick moment if i can tell you exactly why we received three procedures i was about to look into the file the procedure codes are listed independently on there so that's why you yeah it's like we have three lines yep i have the same thing on my message going outbound yeah we've got three of ours that is why we are showing three elevations in the results report as well so if we have only one ovr then you know it will okay and we did not receive it back with the code in the result the test code like a b d what you need you want that back right yeah yeah if you can send it back the way we have sent it in the order let's see it's a p t so we wanna stand back let me look at my server real quick here sure so i need to send back to 712 it'll be our four right 4.14 0.1 and all these are identical like uh can this be done to one instead of 3 look at it again here hang on a second at the end it's uh one is screen memo by then brush and then so keep this is how she puts them in i can't combine the procedure codes together because there are three separate procedure codes um and that's where those three come from like there's a (777 063 77 something for one and then the code too so that's why it pulls those the procedures which are actually being performed based on this template yes then if if we get them in the place will be our 4.1 uh we will be displaying them i think this is what she might be needing to see in when she expands the results i'll confirm that with her because i think pretty much what we have here on this part uh from my understanding is is when she does she does a screening memo but she also does a tomo and she also doesn't complete ultrasound she does all three procedures okay yep uh know what i'm saying is can this not be done in a way like the order is placed like diagnostic uh memo and under that in segment all these three come across can that not be i just have to confirm i should be able to attach it underneath it so like go with the initial code that's where it gets a little bit tricky because if they don't always do that then it's gonna always be different right so i'll dial that piece into her and see exactly what she's gonna do get an idea what i mean yeah so if i always do these three then i could put put the main as the as the screening memo and then i could build underneath it i could build those other codes there with it yep and they can come as observation under the yeah yeah that's what i think that's how it should be so she can at least view and like when she expands the result because uh right now in the m r uh if she does not open the pdf and only expands the results she would only see diagnostic memo uni so if we get and that's and it's all one report so that might not matter to her yeah so you can just ask her whatever she needs uh and we can proceed sure and i'll work on that obr uh 4.1 yeah that should be pretty easy to find sure alright buddy appreciate it oh and you know you know i wonder if um if the space was not there and it was closed up on my side i wonder if i wonder if i would have sent that back i wonder if it didn't go back because it doesn't match yeah maybe i bet that's what it is i may try to make sure um but i'll let you know sure and let me know if you need a new order alright buddy thank you you're welcome"}}, {"id": 989, "data": {"call_id": "1622578045.1222363.txt", "text": "your call has been forwarded to an automated

visited instead of like just typing in a certain spot like is there a way that we could have it when you first open their chart like on my top i have allergy insurance notes but is there like an an added feature that we can put up there that just says patients vaccinated well you can add a check box and the patient demographics page um can you please share your screen so i can uh work with you on this yes my dad um the number is 294 126488 i'm sending you request okay mm i'm speaking with heather alright heather uh see you you go here in the settings tab then over here in e h r you see demographics and the data template right over here once you add a custom field for instance you label it covid vaccine and then you put all genders and then you put a check box in here and you save it okay if you're making it a mandatory field now what you're doing is that you now this is one uh custom field that you have added on the demographics page right now once you go for adding a patient for instance so once you see the screen on this screen down over here you would be able to see a covid vaccine uh custom field where you could check yes or no okay okay and then do i just have like all my other coworkers yes that can happen as well and uh also that i've made it a mandatory field that means that there's a staric over here so every user in your uh practice would have to check it for either yes or no to proceed or to save right okay and uh i believe that this this also would be visible for for all patients there you go right so for everyone once you've opened this page you will have to check either one of them to to resave it and heather her uh one quick question have you logged a support ticket for this question or i should go ahead and quickly no problem let me take you i

use but andrea is actually not in today she called out sick uh she'll be back tomorrow that's fine but there is but there is another user in the office that we set up CureMD application for on friday can you can you ask someone who was having uh the memory issue on chrome on friday when CureMD set up i can't remember the name though is it frank no was a lady that i did a screen share with uh let me see one second please hi this is joanna thanks for calling hey joanna this is peter here how are you good thank you alright so uh we did the screen share on friday remember when we set up the computer yeah i do remember right so i'm actually calling in to take your feedback that how CureMD application is working on that day yeah on friday it was running um perfectly fine and this morning as well i only um had had one incident in which still um locked me out and then the same thing the memory thing came out right but um i mean it's not happening that frequently now because we increase the virtual memory remember yeah it doesn't probably like before it was like a 3-4 times and right now right exactly you can further you can further avoid it um i was telling andrea the same thing that i do see your practice opening up a lot of uh softwares and tabs while you're using CureMD application on chrome one option is that if you guys may switch over to microsoft edge that will right away fix the problem because this problem only appears on chrome and chrome is a memory hungry software it takes a lot of memory and doesn't allow you to like open multiple websites so if we can switch you over to microsoft edge which is a lighter browser and it's exactly like chrome and anything that you're able to do on chrome you can do that on microsoft edge as well and on the other side i increase your virtual memory so that if you don't want to move on to uh microsoft edge and stick to chrome you should be having this problem like more frequently so that's what i did okay so i'll talk to them because we have everything on chrome so yeah i'll let them know and see if anything that we can change and we can give you a call back i think um yeah definitely um i just wanted to check with andrea and andrea uh wasn't in today unfortunately so i wanted to speak with you because i needed a feedback that if those changes changes worked or not so it looks like they did and i'll be calling back tomorrow again and speak with andrea um to see how her CureMD application is working okay and then you guys may decide if you wanted to move on to microsoft edge or not but chrome is also fine but you just have to be conscious that you do not use it a lot like open up multiple tabs if you open a tab use it and then close it that's the best way that you can try okay okay perfect thank you alright no problem joanna i'll call back tomorrow thank you thank you bye"}}, {"id": 999, "data": {"call_id": "1620758813.824004.txt", "text": "thank you for calling curemd this is brian how may i

hello hi scott this is cherln hecker hi returning your call hi cher how are you today i am good how are you this is scott i am fine thank you okay so uh you have some discussion with john foster earlier this week i think last week regarding diagnosis codes not being in the system yeah they're they're in there they were just misfiled they were misfiled can you explain actually what is going on what is the issue sure are you there hello i'm sorry about that um its alright okay so what what did we come up with so what can you please explain the issue what actually is uh the issue what where were you not able to find this diagnosis code okay did i talk to you the other day who else did i talk to the other day it was uh john foster from the ehr team that is a different team they don't deal with this sort of patients okay because it seems like every time i put in a ticket i go into this e this detail somebody comes into my computer they look at it it's the whole 30 minute and then every time when if somebody comes back they want me to repeat the process of that whole ordeal and it's you know it's redundant to me because i'm you know we're extremely busy and it's like why are we going can we narrate the the beginning part if they're not in the fixing process can they not just say you know this person is gonna call you back of course see we do any desk in because we just sometimes uh it's just a workflow error or something the issue is coming up only on your end and not our end so in those that's why we prefer any desk to see your screen to see actually what is going on on your screen so if we can address the issue accordingly that's the only reason we use screen share sections right i guess the frustration is on on some of the other one of the other really important tickets that's yet to be resolved on mine is that i'm in the o r and i could not take a call because i was covering so i was literally in the or for a week straight and so they brought my ticket even though i had spent probably a good hour or so with somebody on the phone going over the problem and the details of the problem and then when i wasn't available because i'm a clinician my whole thing got dropped even though i had made an investment in the problem already in that case so what happens is if we do not receive a response from the client uh in four working days for business days so that's according to that so we close the ticket but if you are busy something like that you just update the ticket and just give us a timeline that call back on this date this time that that will be enough okay because there are many clients that do not you know reply us back yeah uh they log a ticket they don't yeah so that's why okay okay um alright so the issue that we were having is that the rest paying codes are under vascular surgery and they actually should be under arterial codes because the actual number sequence of those cpt codes um it falls in the sequence and then it drops off the three breast pain codes and then continues the sequence after those resting codes so it's like those three are missing and the sequence and then they're misfiled under vascular surgery the codes that you uh mentioned in the ticket are i70.221 i70.222 and 23 yeah 221222223 yes okay let me check it from the icd10 database by the way i see on the claims uh the description of the code is not populated only numbers populate the quarter does not populate in description okay okay so whatever is coming up is only for you to see it will not pop populate on the claim when you send the claim to the insurance only the number on the diagnosis code will populate on the claim no descriptions i70.221 of medium our praise of extremities with the pain right like okay yeah and it is exactly as it is entered in our system is it possible can we do a screen share can you show me exactly where the the codes uh are coming up under vascular surgeon vascular surgery yeah let me let me get in there hold on okay use anydesk btw mhm alright it's 558 889913 thank you sending you the invitation you get back connecting i can perfect let's go to curemd and can you show me the area we just had a storm just blow through so all of a sudden my computer went into my dial code oh yeah yeah see what i mean when i'm dial up now oh no come on i'm gonna go to the remote session oh wait here we go alright let me just go to mm you find a case that's open wrong here i can't even get down there see that that's weird let me make sure wow i can't open the full screen see there's a lot down so the cpt codes uh the diagnosis codes are not populating onto the uh provider note is that the problem okay so here seeing the screen right now can you right now just give me a minute let me switch yep i can see that okay so here we have the arterial code so i'll click on arterial code and you can see the you know the numbers that they start with oh goodness this computer is just like a it's so slow today will be down okay so you know here's the i-70 code starting you know they go all the way down now okay here you have the two the 21 11 21 12 2 13 and then those three rest rest rest pain code should go in between the 2 13 and the 2 33 okay because we go ten and the twenties are missing we have the thirties and we have the forties we have the fifties but we're missing the 2 20 2.20 okay so do you know the uh ipt-10 code for that as well this actually because actually nines are outdated here we can add it the what is missing we're just missing that 221222223 those you know the rest paying the right the left and the bilateral okay let's see can i take the controls for a moment please this is how you add a new diagnosis code so i see i 70.221 you can stop me asking questions if you don't understand this is all we add a diagnosis code from the library to the database okay so i can just add them in there yeah just select them click import and will be added okay so i finally i want to go back to the beginning so i can see where you started because i'm always yeah sure go on okay its alright gon on the just click on the settings i'll direct you you do it yourself so you know yeah click on the

beginning so if you want to add another another series you can select that and click import and the system will add it for you alright i'll just do this one for now don't forget to click on import yeah okay let me finish okay perfect now will this do this or do i need to do this for the physicians computer that wants it nope it's not computer specific user specific it is practice specific so

can actually expand that to see whatever the amount was actually posted before so this is actually coming up at zero so you can actually delete it anyway uh but in order to apply from the section you can simply go to the appointment date now the it depends like how much uh balances left for this month so you can simply click over here and you will see the balance 2 99 and simply add to 99 over here tab and save as soon as you save that this would go green and you can simply save okay perfect so you go under billing and then payment and you click there and just enter the payment did you post two payments against this patient yeah the first one was a mistake so right now it's actually uh showing a -299 is that correct well he paid 2 99 yes no um that's understandable but it's actually

the second appointment which was today was 299 because it was a follow up and it's coming under the same appointment right now yes okay that makes you do that first and let's see what the actual amount is coming up as the uh how much amount is actually being paid by the patient okay okay right now this specific charges already settled if you go to the charge right over here let me show you my thing is just why is it having a it's giving me like an x like i can't click on anything why are you doing that yeah i'm not sure what's going on with my um my mouse it's not letting me click it one moment let me actually do that on my end okay thank you are you trying to post the payment against this appointment rate 57 20 okay the thing is before you post the payment against this um specific appointment you need to make sure you are creating the charge first which shows you see an open balance of 299 and after that you can actually apply to that so the charge that you need to create the charge with the icds and procedures or was actually done today's in the today's appointment and once the charges created then you can go to the payment section the appointment will actually appear over here click on the appointment date and you will be actually clicking on the allocate from un applied and in this you will be putting the apply balance where you want to apply right now and then save it as soon as you will save this you can you will see this will be zerord out and you can save this out so right now you need to create the charge first so you can actually utilize the and applied 60 okay got it now uh carly uh can i ask you if you have a ticket regarding this concern no i don't it would just happen no problem so you're calling from right yes perfect thank you carly you have a great day take care thank you you too thank you for your help no problem"}}, {"id": 1002, "data": {"call_id": "1621956002.1048903.txt", "text": "this is harry uh hi harry this is dave from CureMD hi dave how are you i'm good how are you good i'm good so you mentioned two issues in your email the first one that you want to change the payer id details for all the payers can i get to know why do you want to change the payer id details in there we have received rejection stating payer id is incorrect okay let me check that one moment i think has been updated incorrectly for some other one moment but you know basically when we do the data migration or create a new database we try to make sure you know that the payer id and everything is uh fine and you know according to your state's requirement it is not coming up for any payer let me check that okay so i'm in the database let me look at the rejected do you have an example on top of you have which one is rejected so there are two claims in the rejected bucket one is for atna and the other one is blue cross blue shield community which one is rejected for the wrong uh payer id harry you there yes yes yes so i'm asking which one of those two patients are rejected for the payer id issue uh i don't have the details in front of me i think uh how's the list of patients i have requested him to email it to me because if the claim had been rejected for the wrong payer id it should be showing up somewhere here but again uh i'll double check that but you know the payer ids can be different you might be billing to a different payer id through your old system the payer id depends upon the clearing house contract if you're facing if you're getting rejection for any such insurance or any such patient just let me give me the patient example because you know we have uh tried our best to map the correct payer ids with each payer but you know there are chances of error if that is not the case otherwise everything is perfectly fine in the application and database all the payers are mapped to the correct payer id because you know there is a possibility that maybe there is uh let's say if there is a payer abc if you're billing through your old software that is carrier they might be billing to a payer id 12345 but with our clearing house they have a contract under a different payer id that is 67890 so you know it varies from clearing house to clearing house contractor to contractor that which payer id is being used so uh you know if any issue comes up if any any rejection comes up then definitely let me know about it i'll i'll have someone look into it otherwise the payer ids those are existing in there apparently those might not look right those might not look correct because those are different from your old software but again these are the correct payer ids for our clearing house so everything will be fine so just you know uh go ahead and uh you know do the billing if any issue comes up and then let us know okay okay let me uh have kamlesh email you whenever perfect second issue you mentioned that we are unable to delete or void the duplicate charge list so you mentioned a patient named john so and for this patient you submitted the claim you received a you know a denial saying that this is a duplicate charge and uh you wanted to delete the charge now one thing if you have created a charge and you have submitted it be it may a duplicate it's the wrong one it was submitted by mistake or anything you cannot delete why because there is a reference track it that exists against that charge you have submitted charge to a third party clearing house or maybe an insurance company so we cannot delete anything that is uh submitted to any third party other than CureMD so that charge will stay in CureMD one thing that you can do you can write off the balance you can uh just put that claim in the problem list so that is something that you can do within the CureMD but deleting that charge is not an option okay we cannot void the charges we can you can void you can void like for example if voiding the charges mean like you submitted a charge by mistake and you got the payment now you want to void it you want to return that payment because you know that you you you are not supposed to build that patient for example let's say you have two patients john basketball and john basketball junior so you were supposed to build john basketball junior but by mistake you build john basketball so now you want you have received the payment as well so you want to void the claim in this case in this scenario you're gonna submit a void claim from john basketball and you're gonna submit a claim from the correct patient separately so this is a separate thing if you want if you mean that you know deleting and voiding in in a similar sense then uh you know that's not an option if you want to void that later uh scenario that i have explained to you so yes you can uh submit a white claim to insurance company okay so uh okay understood i got it and and uh ask kamlesh to send me uh the list of patients where the issue has uh come up for the wrong payer id sorry for the wrong payer id so uh i'll look into it and i'll you know get back to you guys as soon as possible sure alright thank you so much no worries have a good day thank you you too"}}, {"id": 1003, "data": {"call_id":

if you can understand my frustration see if we can fix this and doctor use it okay uh so this is basically do you mind if we try this on uh chrome no i don't i should be on chrome no you are not on chrome this is explorer she says right i'm going to move the mouse it says right here i'm on chrome now this this is explorer let me show you chrome it's different this is chrome you see that's how i see this the the main difference is if you look there's an icon and three dots that's chrome explorer always gives you that smiley face if i if i click on uh about the about internet explorer okay sure give me 1 second let me just make sure that you are on the correct cloud that's your old password also changed no i i logged in this morning and did a bunch of billing and i didn't have this trouble and then something happened and no it looks like chrome explorer uh did some kind of update and actually made this one because your profile is still active nobody has done anything to your profile that's what i was checking in the past it's all clear but why it's not letting you log in it's kind of weird let me check one more thing give me one sec okay give me a moment i'm checking something on my end it's really weird even i cannot log with my log in anybody else at the practice doctor who can confirm if they are able to log let me check who is logged in right now i'm the only one who does all the computers there's only two of us here and i'm the one who does all the computer stuff there's only one user for the whole practice and that's just you it's only two people that work here so name it says your account is active it's just weird let me try something else you know what actually you don't leave it here it's weird so i just created a new user profile and i'm able to log in with that user profile for some reason what does that mean for me because i was testing making sure that there's nothing wrong with the cloud or your practice and it's not so it is it is allowing us to do that so let's go ahead and try one more thing this is really weird there's only one location everything else is good and it just started happening a couple of minutes ago a couple couple hours ago well half an hour an hour ago because i i created a new account and i tested it worked for some reason your account this account is not working um i'm gonna have to get my development team look into it see what's going on meanwhile do you want me to go ahead and uh activate a new uh user for you so you can complete your work um i guess so let me at least you okay so you're gonna give me a new name and instead of putting any digits be just i'll make sure that it has all the uh permissions and stuff so you don't have to worry about that okay um so it's just gonna be dgurwood as a user name what about the password is going to be 1234 234 okay do you want to go ahead and just try to dgurwood no number and my number number 123 and i'll give you all the permission so when and then connect password do you think it's or you can use the same password you've been using for the other account i think it's this yes please yes no i'm going to log out and log back in just to make sure please i this maybe have to do with i've never seen oh my god i've never seen these screens this is the home page oh i always go in under this we can we can we can fix that please go ahead and log log in and log back in just to make sure then i'll make that screen as your default and then can you yeah and you want to put the the hold on this is okay it's fixed this is fixed so okay no no no don't press cancel don't press cancel put 1234 and i'll go ahead and put the regular password for yourself the one you think you should have okay no i'm in again can you can you tell me please yeah go ahead and press update password please okay now we're gonna go ahead and accident give me give me a remote control for one second please i wanted to make sure that it is working perfectly fine for you

second hi um yeah the thing is that the reason i called is that our notes like our counselor notes all the ones they're lacking all those blue fields like you know the medication history i think that's on the other i just looked at then uh uh i'm sorry i wanted to confirm again you're saying that uh they're missing components those notes for suboxone is that correct it's on already knows let's see and i'm wondering populates them backwards onto those notes that are already signed that are already signed yeah you've been going on all year and i never knew that that wasn't in there uh well we couldn't populate them back if they were already signed we can only do them for newly created ones but uh the change that you're requesting um can you give me an example of you know like a note template that i can take a look at its counseling addiction counseling uh what's the other ones in the counseling and you're still counseling anything else the one that says uh what's it called the program program counseling i wanna i didn't check that i wanna see if that has been on there okay uh okay the program cancelling does have components such as complaints medical history and medications surgical history and family history but that's it what are you looking at programme counseling five okay okay and then the other account okay so uh we wanna check the others which are like addiction counseling uh counseling addiction initial those ones right okay i have the one called addiction counseling uh five open so let's see the components for them are listed as complaints medical history medications surgical history family history social physical yeah that one is an addiction counseling uh five or addiction counseling v i don't know what you're saying addiction counseling V another last word can you spell the last one that you're saying we or five in roman i didn't know there was 15 i think there was anything like that okay uh let's see what else we got uh counseling uh okay counseling initial let's go to that one all right we got counseling initial visit for that yep we have all the components again complaints medical history medications surgical history family history social history and physical exam okay the next one uh yep now the next one alright i think we've already recovered counseling addiction there's also one counseling individual that one has uh some fun in the beginning which has counseling individual then patient with seeing video chat patient comes to office for counseling regarding work and relationship issues patient feeling actions at times somewhat depressed and then we have uh yeah it has all the blue ones medical history medications surgical family and social and then at the bottom it has psychiatric uh history the custom form okay let's check uh what else is there counseling initial uh there's also uh program or peer counseling you want me to check that one as well i thought you could check program i'm sorry std said you just uh test program oh you just said you checked program uh yeah the program uh counseling yeah i checked that one but i was talking about another one which is labelled a program or pe counseling initial okay i don't know what pe counseling initial the account yeah but it's got the same components in blue it says pe counseling initial i don't know what that is you should take that out because there's like one called uh program slash pe counseling initial but yeah if you wanted an active sure let's just make it an active uh wait a minute okay is there one called program cancelling oh that's the only one that should be active so there's one that's slash pure counseling yeah that's another one uh huh do you know which one has been used lately from chris howard yeah chris howard let me check chris howard uh let's see what he uses for program counseling yep he's using the normal program counseling one oh yes ok then just put the other one in active okay counseling okay uh let's see what's left there's also uh the one labeled only counseling one provider now labeled only counseling that has uh the specialities i saw the other last one wait a minute what was it labelled what was it uh simple counseling nothing else counseling that's just me saying simple counseling counseling okay then that uh what's left um std testing counseling if you have wait a minute you have you have individual counseling and regular counseling right uh let's see yeah there's regular counseling and there's uh individual let's see yeah uh yeah counseling individual yeah that one we checked already you kept that yep that has all of the everything okay so i don't need i don't need the let's take off can you take out the word individual and keep that and put and put counseling as an active okay let's see alright keep the counseling individual and take out the one that says counseling just leave the counciling do they look the same the notes uh well there is a slight difference let's see counseling individual that contains a bunch of text as well as well as the psychiatric history custom form and the other one uh let's see the one labeled counseling yeah the counseling only has like uh a list of components like the complaints and medical history has no text and it doesn't have the social history uh form that you guys have used i'm gonna look at them both when i get home and um can i just email you want to take out to make we've got a lot that's all the council yeah just uh let me make sure there's just one more uh addiction yep yep and that's all of them yep they're all good okay look at rodgers and michael because those are they're using some notes with all the blue is missing i don't know what okay which are the users again there's michael uh dan rogers okay let me check them both because i can only verify once i look at the notes all of them and make sure they all are using them with the blue i mean there's only the they should only be using addiction counseling um an addiction counseling individual i mean initial and counseling and counseling that's all they only before okay because yeah could you give me an example because the ones i'm looking at currently they have all the medical history and stuff loaded uh i'm checking a few notes for down rogers for the 24th and yeah like the counseling addiction ones uh most of them have all the you know blue components it's so strange because i just randomly checked one of each and they all did not have it i'm gonna have to look if you could just uh go with me for example if you could uh check the ones for may 24 if you could just compare ah compare them to what uh may 24 for dan rodgers and the other one you mentioned was uh provider michael amount let's see he doesn't have any on 24 he has some today let me check those uh alright counseling let's see uh yep i'm seeing them here as well uh for michael as well oh wow all right i'm i'm gonna have to look let me know didn't like that but they weren't on there i don't know what templates i think i i don't know what counsel you know i don't know you can i don't know if you can can you scan the calendar and see the template you can see it at a glance right yea what templates you use yea do they all look normal okay so like uh yeah most of them like the counseling addiction uh the addiction counseling most of them are those other than that those are most of their appointments you know addiction counseling so whichever one i'm uh pulling up a random i am getting all the components voted in the hold on josh one second hold on one second um so they're all the ones we've talked about alright yeap so we'll leave it i'll look again and i'll tell you which ones i need made an active that should be it then yeah because they all have them unless of course you know they're taking them off themselves backs and then that could be a whole other thing but the templates unloaded they'll happen oh my god i gotta talk to them all right alright but yeah perfect alright thanks no problem have a good day"}}, {"id": 1014, "data": {"call_id": "1620830639.835421.txt", "text": "the person you are calling is not available press zero

parkway between brighton beach and ocean view after hello hello remy yeah the line cut off yeah i was yeah i was kind of going through okay okay one second if you can tell me that any desk number too thank you for calling the garden of health a multi specialty medical group located at 30 39 hey maya hello yeah we got disconnected maya uh i don't know what happened but i have no idea why we got disconnected uh might have been a line thing but yeah i just called back just to make sure that i can assist you with the training so uh rammy if you wouldn't mind providing me the any desk 9-digit code so i can send a request over yes uh rammy can you provide me any desk 9-digit code again just so i can send you the request what happened what happened uh i just need to send you an any desk request again since we got disconnected oh okay okay okay uh i have the same one 850 okay got it 729752 got it awesome okay and i've sent the request over if you wouldn't mind just accepting that rammy okay amazing guys so without uh spending time on as much as we have right now before it gets disconnected again hopefully i'll just continue where i left off so uh as i showed you before maya that we can create a note either going to do today's patient the patient itself our scheduler isn't it better in the morning i'm sorry yes okay so i'm going to watch here uh no no i'm sorry i'm just gonna show you i didn't i didn't know if you were talking to me or they were multiple voices in the background so uh i'm just gonna show you so over here when you're on the schedule right just for demonstration purposes okay i'm gonna schedule an appointment in the previous just a test appointment to show you so i'm just gonna go ahead pull up a test station for you ma'am there we go i'm just gonna schedule it schedule just gonna fill out everything real quick for you awesome there we go and let's schedule this right here okay so there we go we just schedule the patient now let's say that's the patient that you want to create a note for so you click on the patient and then after you've checked in the patient it gives you this option so it's just like that basically what's the reason so after you've done saving that just checking in the patient it goes to yellow but that's not as concerning but as soon as we click on the patient's name again and when it's purple you can see there's a create note option right here so that's where we need to click ok and this can be done as i mentioned here here or here these are all shortcuts for you so we create a note and then we're given this page okay so my for this uh as you can see pretty straightforward we have the provider no template that is specific notes that were made for your practice let's say if there is a note that you use frequently you can find it right here visit reason as it says location roll all this kind of stuff you can fill that in as uh it applies to the note okay and let's say i create a note i hit create and in just a moment and here we go so this uh automatic automatically populates now most of the stuff that is already applicant towards the patient you can see that already populate so their social history all that kind of stuff now as you're going through the note it is very easy to update this so if you click on a component maya that will open it up and you can either search or in case if you cannot find what you're looking for you can add one on the go so that is how you can update each and every one of these components i'm just gonna give you a quick look as you can see you can either look for them or you can add one on the go and same thing as you move along you can do that with each and every single component uh the good thing is my let's say most of the things are applicable for you they do need to be filled out let's say some of these don't really need to be there you don't have to fill this out do not need to where you things that you do not fill out they will automatically be removed once you save and sign the note but i will get into that in just a short while now on the left side maya all of these things these histories diagnosis vitals all these uh elements we have right here these are within your practice and these are the things that let's say if they are specific physical exams are allergies or order results anything within the practice you can find them and add them from right here so you click them and you'll have your own databases history of all those forms available and it is as easy as clicking filling this out and then accepting and then you will have a new module right here and yet again as you move along you just pretty much fill out everything that is applicable to you let's say once everything is done i'm just gonna go ahead and do this for you so let's say we've just completed all of this every component and with the menu and after that what we will do is we will go ahead and sign the note you're about to sign the note and we click okay meaningful use should be shared so just kind of giving you an overview so let's say you be like hey uh print note so you have your note right here and uh you can kind of see that the date of the counter you have the daytime all those things checked in and as soon as you click save that is just save that note now let's say we have this patient right here i'm just gonna write the account number down so we have 26763 okay so i've saved it i've signed it i've saved it i go into the patient patient number account number was 26763 i'm gonna look up the patient going to the patient like the provider note and as you can see so that is pretty much how you create a note so from three different places different components you can fill them out as i mentioned according to your needs uh at the end you just need need to make sure that you sign off the note and then you hit save and the same provider note can be uh went ahead and access from the patient profile but let's say for example you want to edit the note that we just made so if you go into the scheduler again and just look at the patient you click on the patient again with the left icon and now you can see there's an option for edit note uh so you can actually go ahead and edit that as well if you have any else changes to make you can make those changes you can hit save and that'll just be updated as it is so that's pretty much about on how and where you can go ahead and create these notes different components and how you can fill those components and how you can search and add different elements into those components as well how you can sign that and how you can save that and how you can go back into a patient and actually view that provider note and as well as edited for future purposes so that is pretty much when it comes to signing off and uh saving all the provider note so since you'll be doing this yourself this is the work flow and uh so any questions so far anything at all that you probably uh have a question about yeah questions come up later most questions i'm just sitting here on the washing you okay okay so yeah so let me just uh just check my notes just to kinda see if i did uh miss out anything uh within the training just so we can save time so uh would you mind just giving me one moment uh my um just so i can kind of go through my notes hello maya yeah just give me one moment okay i'm just gonna go through my notes real quick please leave your message for (917) 535 80 seven five yeah uh yeah so yeah just uh one last thing that i forgot to go over so that's just creating a super bill e super bill which is the last step so after you filled out the form you filled out everything signed it saved it then you create the e super bill so you click on this it kind of gives you all these these icd 10 codes all that kind of stuff you fill this out and then you click save and that will create your super bill and yes before that yes you have to sign and save that as you did the provider note itself so that is pretty much it when it covers this uh part of the training so i'll take your questions as a safe from a how soon after like it's likely signals i'm i'm sorry my i wasn't able to get that your voice is a little it seems like you're a little far away my apologies um how long i mean how like how often i'm supposed to hit the button safe how long after do you need to hit the save button so you're asking when do you need to hit the save button okay so uh maya let's say you're on the note okay the uh this note right here let's say i'm just adding one real quick okay i'll tell you so you do not need to hit it every time you change a component the only time you need to hit save let's say here i'll just show you real quick uh just to kinda give you a visual itself so uh just gonna fill this out real quick for you maya creating it and yes that's a really great question because if you do not hit save let's say uh it will not save anything usually mostly in software is when you go back it does happen but he is very precise since it's very uh critical information so for this what happens is once you filled out everything and let's say you say yeah i'm done with this note only then can you go ahead and hit save so let's say if you go one by one it doesn't really matter so i would suggest at the end just make sure you fill everything out then you hit save so that will save this note right here okay so you need to hit one save after you filled out everything but in case you let's say go ahead and you have something else to do you can save it as far as you left it and then remember i showed you you can go and edit the note okay so if you save it and don't sign it right and you can save it and come back then edit it again fill out anything that was missing then sign it and then that gives you an option in case you want to come back to it and after you save this then the creates option is what we hit so i'm just gonna save this oh no no no not the okay it's safe super bill just gonna hit the patient new patient creating and there we go so the icd tens all that kind of stuff you'll fill that out and one time you need to do the same save and sign safe well that's pretty much too in one so you can either hit this or you can hit this than this but yeah so that's pretty much it's a one time for the provider notes and one for the e so uh any more questions might have anything at all no okay uh so maya if everything is done with uh can i go ahead and with your consent and close the ticket okay amazing can i talk with me before i uh just uh disconnect the call is it possible hey rami hi hi so remy i went ahead and i showed my aware she can go ahead and create the note how she can create a note and then went through each components uh in which you can add a different elements into the components i showed her how to save it signed the note create a e super bill and uh yeah so pretty much went over anything uh so for maya i did ask if there's any more questions but since this is a very fairly new training for maya i would personally i would personally love if you can write down my personal extension if you do face anymore uh things you might need more assistance with please go ahead and you can call me directly and i will be more than happy to assist you further so i just wanted yeah amazing so you can give that to maya in case my if you face any um anything at all please make sure you can call me i'll be more than happy to help you but if everything is done for right now uh can i go ahead and close

that's i don't know what exactly happened here but let's see i'm gonna try to open it up on my account number 28599285 okay that's good thomas from february the 25th right correct oh here it looks all fine oh so when you go to print it it comes out fine that that's um uh that's what i can see over here if we printed that's appearing all fine but there was something wrong with the note itself i mean i can print it like that's what i need i need to do anyway right but it needs to be needs to be actually looked into by our product team to see what's going on uh you wanna try printing it see if it's sure yeah let me see how it looks have you visited yeah my my printer is super slow i'm sorry it's coming yeah it's coming right right wait why is it working why did print double sided but um yeah i guess that's it came out fine the note came out fine actually and as in explosions wait but i'm trying to see i don't see like let me see yeah it doesn't have ever it doesn't actually doesn't have everything there it's like it doesn't show like the location and so it's the note is not really right actually alright just a minute i'm trying to take a picture here thank you i'm gonna it's only for this particular patient right no it has i've uh we've been noticing it for all of the patients that we do it and it's only the excision note the rest of the referral notes to find it's just for the excision and repair note okay so there is a particular no template which is used yes correct okay can you pull up that note template here uh yes let me pull it up um it actually looks different now

and since when have you been using this one what this problem started this note template when did you get it added using that template you know what i think when we updated the that's when it started messing up we just updated it like a few weeks ago maybe like a month or two oh where where are you from uh server to cloud the template was messed up okay well probably it needs to be uh redid or something so i'm gonna i'm gonna escalate it to the uh you know to the uh customization team to take a look and to have it updated for now i'm gonna also request for for for the for the back end team

md okay hold on 1 second okay i'm logged in alright do you know any desk how to use any desk on cell phone and any desk yes can you go to the uh you know the app store and search for any desk to yeah on my ipad right does it matter bear with me the remote desktop software okay it's downloading okay so can you try to open it give me 1 2nd okay okay it's asking me for a remote address right just uh 1 2nd i should you should you should also have like um this desk number right it also have a number it says your address alright just 1 2nd oh uh okay may i have the number it's 752 380 348 okay to get a problem uh click it up uh can you go to main screen uh go to safari open cure md now do you want to open me to open up the consent form yes go to safari and show me how do you sign okay so do you see where i am hello yeah yeah i'm here my name is bryce yes i am seeing okay so let me just i'll show you okay should have skipped there this stuff here we go see i type in next i have to type in my concern this is not valid okay hold on um just give me 1 2nd can you go up top where you have to enter other you know signature yeah okay so you're basically registering a patient for portal or if i'm not wrong yeah so yeah we have to register for the patient portal this is where we hold like you know all the demographics and concerns right uh one second okay well i don't think so we do have options here to sign so you have the patience to sign uh with the hand written signatures at this particular portal whatever they can do sign with uh i mean once they are registered in cure md the application all right within the application they do have option to sign consent form with the finger but not here uh why not here it's uh in the patient portal i think this option is not uh generated yet you know it's not will be station portal yes but i can show you like once you have uh registered a patient in an actual emr system right they can sign consent forms there okay can you show me how is this you know i'm trying to make this as easy as possible for patients and that kind of do an extra stuff but i guess you can take a look sure um can you close this i mean can you go to cure m d demographic can you open a patient's profile you can save this if you want no it's okay i wanted to open a patient uh profile but i have to go to the cure md yes okay do you want me to go to the patient's profile you said yes and open any patients from the left tree menu click on provider notes and like letters expanded click on the plus sign next yes clinical letters so just click on the add add button what am i adding uh just select any letter and then create letter click on the create letter okay uh you see at the very bottom there's a signature option here now uh if you notice at the top right corner where you see uh there's uh like a hand there's a pen red cord uh this one or mhm let me open it there you go click ok and it will be inserted within you know wherever your cursor will be yeah what about down here yeah you can bring your curse there down here yep and then click on the icon okay yeah it doesn't bring it down here though um it's a bit tricky you know uh the cursor okay let me try can you double tap on signature where its written signature of i can't read it it's really blur right here uh all the way to the bottom signature of yeah now click on it click on that icon okay i see mm okay so this way you can have patients find the complaint forms within cure md but unfortunately not in patients so how do other practices sign consent forms this way excuse me how do other practices sign consent forms for the patients they can always do this to consent sign the consent form just like this you have to show them the concern form or whatever the contents and yeah that's just be easier for them just to sign in are you familiar with patient now uh familiar with what sorry patients now patient now yeah it's like an emr system uh not really sorry yeah so what they have is their consent forms just kind of like this but they can say i don't know why cure md doesn't have this because now we have to just go to there it's just like another step it just be easier for them okay um is there a way for you to send me a c s v file of all the patients in our in emr system uh of what files csd file i need all i need to transfer all of our patients in cure md into a different database um because unfortunately i just don't think cure md is working for us um i've had another complaint last week we keep when people keep um finishing their consent we get like an error message and everything transferred over but their consent forms i've noticed like the demographics it's just there's too many issues unfortunately and it's not your fault of course but i just want you to it's just there's so many issues with cure md um so i just don't think it's fit for us any longer um so if there could be a file with all the patients sent to me so i can transfer them to a different database i know it's possible i did speak to someone they said they can do that okay uh who did you who did you talk to already i'm sorry what did you say who did you talk to you about this already about this oh a different a different company they've worked with all these emr systems they said it's 100% um possible because it's our medical record that we would just need a csv file okay and have you informed anybody in cure md before that so if you no no no i haven't yet i was gonna try to make this work with cure md today to see if this is possible but unfortunately this is just it's just not gonna work for us um so if you can ask someone i don't know who and your team that are able to do that sure i can do that for you no problem tell me like if it's uh more like a consent consent barnes uh in patients portal they're not able to sign in and it's the consent forms and patient portal um we keep getting it crashes on us the app crashes crashes on us every day like at least 50 times a day if we fax this on the app it crashes um the server ever happens almost every day the patient has to completely re fill out the form um yeah so just unfortunately like as a busy practice we just can't operate with this if it keeps having all these issues okay i also have another ticket uh from uh someone i was working with them actually they're i think it was also regarding a claim form yeah so it's probably one of my colleagues down in florida uh huh um she mentioned also the cure md is crashing yeah so it's been crashing for a long time um if you back more than once on the app once you're typing on like a photo it will crash okay let me just check that okay if that's the case uh i can have someone give you a call about this concern okay and uh since the you had a question that um unfortunately i couldn't have a session with jennifer okay i i called her on friday but uh she was i think not available i already have that uh crashing ticket with me that the cure md is crashing whenever she has to you know uh complete the consent forms of the patients that is crashing actually uh so yeah let me just go ahead and um have someone give you a call about this and is it possible if you can look into that crashing problem because uh have you logged any ticket or have you informed anybody else before about the crashing we have multiple times in the past year um it was it's it's uh they said it was like it needs a software update or whatever it may be um but it's been happening for so long i don't know i don't know if it's an app issue but it just hasn't been resolved i think they fix it for like a week and then it happens again okay well uh okay let me have someone give you a call and or you know please jennifer give me a call i can assist you with the crashing issue okay okay yes and uh we can discuss this further that and about the consent form i can reconfirm with the team patient proper team if there's any way patients can sign their concents i mean patients can sign their forms whenever there is like a for you to sign you know consent form can you give me that particular uh screen again where you have to sign patients patients have to sign the forms different forms portal screen um just bring it up a little bit and let me see if it was yeah to restart now here we go can you go all the way up yeah okay just one second so this is consent yeah so this is i can send for one of the procedures and then let me ask uh team real quick just one second okay well um as far as the response from the team is that they can only you know use the name of the patient and when when you're signing the consent form but let me see let me do some research on it and we'll get back to you okay okay sounds good okay thank you alright thank you i'll

b team role that the tasks are not assigned that you're not able to the users are still not able to view this task yes okay can we have a screen share right now just a quick one on any desk sure one second and for which practice you're trying to take a look for four hours fine um uh it's 494 zero 10284 okay and can you please tell me the name of the user that you added to the b b team role um it's brian have to look at it uh doing this again i have the list in front of me so uh can you please go to the b b team role area like from where you assigned the task or like the creative but like just comes up um you're not having the access before i did this happened to me before too and then i had to wait until i got access again i had access yesterday i don't know what's going on okay this happened before too and i had to wait i don't know why it does that just give me a moment benefits verification okay just give me a moment after driving that no i meant to kelly's oh god we'll have to scan it probably i think that's why she wants me to go okay now you have the access log in on 1 second let me just yeah just do that all right so what's the now let's just do one thing uh can you please go to the follow up thing and show me so that i can see where we are missing it oh yeah so um let's see if i have a patience you can opening test patient as well if you want to any just test patient okay probably do it on test patient instead of being doing it um do we have one there are tons of i'll leave the test cool um alright so you said that's how i do it i put this specified to b b team okay okay just give me a moment okay so the thing is right now this b b team if you're checking this b b team so let me just show you what's the difference you see this includes support users so because right now only in the b b team like in the without the support that there's only one account that i showed you last time so if you check the support user option then you will be able to see those users at the at the bottom you see these users are now visible so support for in order to be able to assign it to any support users you need to add them you need to manually select them from over here because these users are the support ones so that is why you like whenever you select d v team it's only forwarded to one person only and that is just give me a moment let me just guide you who it is that is so like b b team without the support user that is peter i believe he's the owner by the office manager of the practice so that's that's come up with it so that is assigned to peter so but if you want to assign it to your b b team users like the support users one so you need to check mark this one let's just get it done again one more time let's just remove this one you need to add user check mark this include support users and make sure that they have the correct location this one for us buying rehabilitation in your profile and at the bottom then you'll be able to see the records over there you see look here how do i know which one it is they all are they all are the support users from the b b team to whom this rule has been assigned to them so it's it's someone in brian so if you want to search for brian i'll probably guide you i i see bridget i don't see any brian you need to confirm the user name uh yeah like the first name and the last name yes yes sure yeah you can able to find it how was it uh practice user and i believe that's what i was looking for i believe you don't have the still don't have the access to the settings to the practice user let me just literally had yesterday wait a minute you can find it over here by selecting all support users and make sure that you will be b b team and i believe alright you can search it from over here okay let me just see real quick oh this one so this is the user that needs brian langford mhm mhm yeah okay and can you do one thing if you can log out and log back in on cure md and can you open the practice 1st okay mhm here it is this is brian i believe brian langford ferraro needs to be able to um do the task too that that that user needs to be able to see it needs to be able to see it see the location was that the atlantic medicine onto his profile so you can add the location as well so that's what's so when you search him brian lankford you can type in the subject and then it will be assigned to him and then he will be able to can we just change his location yes sure we can do that so just like the regular uh yeah we don't use that medicine one you see most of the users are having this location so you want this for brian only they said that the only one they use so i think it still says a latin atlantic medicine doesn't matter it doesn't matter it will show up still yeah let me just look at that yeah they believe the initial one is i think you need to change it um in the back end where it said location yeah i need to remove that respond to something like that make sure you check this support okay i have a question so because now they have to search bryan they can't just there's no way for it to just come up on like a few ones the few first ones yeah i'm afraid not because uh the first ones are the users that are in the practice and then comes the support users so that is actually the problem alright okay okay alright that's fine then alright we'll test it on monday just to make sure it works it will work it will work for sure now okay okay great thank you you're welcome bye bye have a good weekend you too"}}, {"id": 1027, "data": {"call_id":

hey how are you doing i'm fine thank you how are you yeah i'm good as well uh i still haven't um i still really don't have the numbers from the reports and we're coming up on june where we'll have to do you know the next report but um can you either send it to me again or or like just tell me the numbers or something uh the one for that is gonna be upcoming for the last 12 months of june yeah but i'm talking about december's and marchs i still don't have mhm okay you need those sent again well you were working on some did you ever okay so on april 16 you sent the last visit report and it says please find attached list of all patients with last within the 12 months so then okay i will let me see what the issue was okay so you put them in tabs at the bottom so like i'm looking at list and i asked you if if the no charge notes like phone notes and stuff like that were included in this and you said no correct yeah because these are basically i've selected the appointments of the criteria so basically any appointments on the schedule i'm taking that as a criteria not the notes themselves so this is for sure people we actually saw indeed yeah so any people that had an appointment and the appointment is you know still existent on the scheduler those are the people that are on okay um hold on let me see so there's just so many emails um oh they are both right here okay here december okay let's see december so is this the final copy like this is the one yeah this is uh the one i worked on last now uh i did have one other thing in mind we could also filter by appointment reasons so if there's any reason that you have to you do not want included on this report say like if you might have uh i don't know one physicals run for like any particular appointment reason that you don't want you know included in this report that you saw the patient for um it's really just the surgery center which i feel like it's gonna be like uh you know because they have a lot of notes so for every one patient that we see at the surgery center we have to open uh three notes well four four notes i just felt like that may you know messed up up but according to this for example like texarkana from december through december saw 8,835 active patients um and they saw 8405 so it's about a 400 a difference of about 400 patients so that's what we're trying to that's what we're trying to achieve by doing this is determining okay from now we're about to do june we're about to do june 20 um june 2023 june 2021 and so we can look from march to june yeah has it decreased or increased you know yeah it makes sense to do it this way i guess because this is i guess uh the only way that we have so far but there's any better way of course i'll let you know okay okay other than that uh just one question uh before we can you know finish up uh there are a few reasons that i just noticed which are like a see nurse note or billing note do you want those appointment reasons included on as well because i think those are only for notes right those are not actual appointments right right so those are the ones that i don't want i see so anything that has like no on it any appointment reason that is we should definitely take that out of the report right right okay alright let let me just yeah this one probably has all of them so let me do them again for march and december and uh when the when june comes up i'll send you the one for june as well okay go ahead and when you redo march and december go ahead and resend those to me please yeah of course okay i'll look out for it because i'm wanting to get this completed today okay i'll uh redo them and uh hopefully i should get them by you today if not then will probably be monday if not today but uh yeah anything else thats it okay alright then um you have a good day thank you bye thank you bye"}}, {"id": 1028, "data": {"call_id": "1621951747.1046662.txt", "text": "this is angie hi angie this is ben fisher calling from cure m d

now yeah that's fine alright so let's do any desk and let me take a look what you're talking about okay let me see what i have to get on a different computer give me a hard time or not definitely my computer's like super slow uh do you restart the computer daily uh no no well so so what happens is that if you don't restart your computer daily it's not that it's it's harmful or something it's only that you know each click that you are creating it's creating a file at the background and it stays there in the temporary memory of the computer unless cleared so if you restart your computer by the end of the day or the start of the new day so it clears all the temporary memory in the computer and spares all the space for you for that day to work on to so that you know you can work on to your computer in your processes quite fine so it's always recommended that you restart your computer by the end of the day or the start of the next day oh i came home okay oh here we go 237503594 thank you i'm sending you the request angie alright ui can see you screem and can you bring up the patient that you are talking about yeah it actually happened okay the weird thing is is you know we give a lot of you probably don't know much about the medicines but we give a lot of procreate and you have to have this etiology of anemia or whatever when you do it just take it okay where's my medicine at and yesterday even the ones that were already billed were saying it wasn't there and now it's back this is what i was talking about this was missing yesterday and on the patient and i've already signed off the other ones but even on the patients that this was already billed on like the drop down would be there but you could do anything with it and every time i go to sign the sign the notes that would say blah blah blah was inactive and i was like inactive but like i said it looks like it's fixed now order that you created yesterday is there any administration done after that no i actually had to stop because i couldn't finish it because i couldn't get that part of it to work alright so can you try it now let's see if that works yeah like i said i had started this order yesterday i don't know why it went away okay that's good now like i said it was it wasn't even there yesterday uh well i didn't do nothing maybe it was just a glitch maybe i'm not sure so it's good now yeah like i said let me let me do one thing yes because i didn't even get to do this yesterday because i stopped because i wanted to have an example because i had already signed all the other ones right there like i said maybe it was just one of those monday morning glitches i got it on the phone right uh did i might check it again yeah let me go out of that and go back in it yesterday yeah see this drop down right here can you see are you still looking at my screen yes i can see this see this drop down right here this was even like missing yesterday but it's back today like i said it but it kept saying it was inactive which like i said maybe it was just a computer glitch or maybe something all right you do this over here and i would like to take take a look at something here you you complete this one oh well i mean i can i gotta put i gotta do some more stuff i gotta put a lab work in it so that'll take me another minute but you go ahead and do what you wanna do let you take over in the integration i wanna change i've never i've never clicked on that i don't know if you take that yesterday i'm not sure if somebody took it off and added them back or something there maybe somebody was messing with it yesterday i don't know maybe so somebody might have taken it off so you know i mean i can take it off like this and i will hit okay and it stay here so it will show it there okay so at least i know how to check it next time like if i yeah so like it kept saying that was inactive yesterday that so maybe that's what was going on maybe somebody had messed with it maybe but now so now that now that you showed me where that is i know where to look for it i need to put those two back yeah yeah yeah there you go so we're gonna save here so they're here i'm gonna they're they're so go ahead and try it again i wanna see if it's working fine yeah so yesterday like yesterday this it would be a drop down right here but this like this ideology name was missing and i could click this and nothing would show up like it was like no drop down at all it was almost like this was blank yesterday well there could be a possibility there was going on well there's no update yet so uh you know there is there there's no update which could have done that maybe some user was doing it and then they put it back or something i'm not sure but anyhow you got it and now you know where can you fix it from so if you ever send me how to fix something you know me i can fix it after you showed me sometimes it takes me figuring out how to do something right most of the times it's the settings understanding it's practice configurations okay you wanna do this window so you can click right on the top of here uh this is just to show you that uh about the workplace yes okay i've seen that and i

people are supposed to have so yeah i'm trying i'm trying to remember even have to log in curemd at this point so i'm gonna need a refresher well well well uh it's it's always a good you know thing to hear back from people that you know for a long time so alright so uh i think marcus is gonna take over the call from here all into win where you know it's appropriate and uh over to you thank you blake alright tanya and jamie uh before we had it for our vaccine management system set up for katapa i just have a few concerns which you know uh the prerequisites that i need to confirm on my end so that while i'm setting your uh practice for this you know i'll keep those things in mind and then we'll go ahead and you know uh get you live on this particular project so um without further ado i have the first question that comes into my mind is that do you have any goal life date in your mind that you can provide me when you actually want to go live uh yeah june 22nd june 22 perfect yeah that's when we actually have appointment scheduled or you know we'd like to of course join our training and everything yeah that's perfect because it gives me a lot of time to prepare things on my end and then you know to provide you with the trainings and if you come across any questions we're you know we're always here to answer you on that so yeah that's a good stay awesome so and moving forward then we have uh we have to confirm the vaccine schedules the times and the location so i'll break them down uh do you have a time limit in your mind like when you want to start your you know calendar from you know at eight am in the morning nine a.m. in the morning from you know the start time at the end time it's uh 9:00 9 - six alright yes uh so we have days as well yeah so tuesday wednesday and thursday tuesdays and thursdays only perfect wednesday too wednesday too alright so what did you guys build the calendar for us well uh for starters we will help you set up everything and while we set up our training session you know after this call we'll walk you through on how you can utilize your vaccine management system within cure md and how it is working on the novel health platform and after that you will be i'm pretty sure that you will be able to you know set your calendars by yourself and you know you will be able to manage everything but if you come across again uh if you come across any concern or any question um i am here to help you out and blake is here to help you out so that's not a problem but how to create calendars and how to manage things we will take care of these things in our training session which we will conduct ask for your availability um marcus too we would like to have our appointment folks and folks cancer and archival vaccine lines that are scheduling appointments to schedule them directly into curemd so i don't think at this time we don't we won't be using the online so hi this is blake now uh jamie could you explain that a little bit to me to for me to understand sure so um the process where you like submit a link to us and the person can go and register themselves get that and register everyone ourselves yeah yeah yeah certainly so they were calling in for a regular appointment in our clinic okay so basically you don't want to enable the link for the patients to schedule their own appointments not at this time that's fine that's that's an easy thing okay yeah all right alright awesome yeah thank you blake alright so um do we have you know uh different locations for this as well where you will be administering the vaccines like uh or it's just the katapa county it's just gonna be here in our health department yes alright awesome perfect and um for the vaccine codes we have those okay and for the fee schedule do we have the updated fee schedule or are there you know that needs to be updated yeah we needed yesterday and put those admin codes in our schedule alright so 2021 awesome so they are updated already right yes and this could have also been added to our immunization program awesome awesome alright and for this purpose since you know we will be using this as an automated process so um for the vaccine no template do you have one already created or you want us to create one for you because you know uh for the automation process we have limited the no template to you know uh very certain things we cannot fill in you know the whole details in it so we do have one template that can be used for this but if you have already you know in your no template library you can let us know the name of it and i can review it and let you know what can be you know changing that so um we have not been entering a note into cure um so far the only thing we have currently is our regular immunization note template for like and things like that we don't have one specifically for all right not a problem i will then create one for you guys and that will be you know using the automation process it will have the immunization details in it the diagnosis you know uh and the procedure so these three things will be added in that uh note that i will create for you and then do we have any consents that you would like uh from the patients while you know getting vaccinated because the note template or anything include the free nation questionnaire um can i can i will be here for a second so yes because i don't think they will be using any consent uh because the consent was basically designed for the patients when they're registering online if they are registering the patients um you know themselves so if the reason why he's asking for the consent is because if you before you administrating vaccine do you want to the the patient to sign any consent um we're not doing it right now uh we're not doing that you can skip this part then marcus alright and another thing here i wish actually i'm not aware of is katapa currently using inventory model uh we do use that but not for immunization alright so we can get that would you like to use it for the immunization or no how hard is it to get it set up and to use it like then it's like climbing the first ladder um it's just gonna take a little bit getting used to uh i must say that if you're not comfortable to you know add the vaccine and the inventory module then you're gonna have to print a bar code it's it's not that much of a big deal but it may delay your goal life it depends because you're gonna have to add all the large number and things like that in there let's skip that part but it is still will the information that gets um crossed over to see cvms where are in where we're getting our inventory reports that will still be happening in occurring as we just back out of cure that is correct okay so as long as they're vaccine report and see cvms is correct yes because there are other agencies who are not using the inventory module but they're still you know getting the data reported to cvms so you know uh that should not be a problem okay and that that that is still like since it happens every night it should be current um it depends on you basically we can do it every day we can do it i'll give an example of an agency so they have clinics on tuesday and friday so they want the tuesday's data to be submitted before friday i mean thursday and then the friday's data should be submitted before the close of day end on monday but there are other agencies who want to submit it on a daily basis as well so you define and give us the time uh sorry schedule when you want us to upload the data to cvms could be today it could be a day later you just tell us when because we have to feed that information to the yeah i would think for us it would need to be by the end of the clinic day so how would that work let me just ask this question for billing how would that work like say for example we had 100 people today and i wanted to hold a claim or two because i didn't insurance information in there how do that um so basically if you are administering 100 vaccines a day and all of the documentation is that correct then all of that information will be sent to cvms on a daily basis because the agencies are submitting on a daily basis there documentation is that correct right for example um our process here is we're our check in staff we're not gonna really have them enter the insurance information our billing staff are gonna do that and we're gonna periodically pick it up through the day and enter it say it's like five o'clock and where our clinic goes to six so those folks coming in from 5 to 6 their insurance information won't be entered until the next morning how do i keep 30 patients from going out oh um i think we could define some rules because all of these rules are you know added before your go live and the reservation to cbms we can definitely add something we can come to an agreement on seven rules and then obviously we'll define all of those rules okay so you can have things to c v m s daily but not insurance um i will have to discuss that in a later call first we have to just write this down uh that for example if they want to filter out certain patients to be submitted to see vms on a daily basis do we have the capability in our robot to do that okay so we'll get back to you on this fantastic thank you marcus and marcus you can send that to josh he will be able to get you the answer perfect alright so i did notice that and i will send it out to josh to confirm on this and moving further here i have a few more questions uh tanya and do we have any you know rough number of you know appointments that you are going to be seeing per day mm yes i mean are we 500 600 no no i think we're probably looking at um less than 200 right now we're doing about 200 appointments a day 200 appointments per day that should be good to manage alright and we are having moderna pfizer and johnson available um just moderna and well all three perfect mhm so that's something do we need to have a schedule built for friday for jenson alright and um marcus let me say this too we were just talking so like on fridays what we typically do with our jenson vaccine since we don't have a lot of folks who want that we take calls throughout the week and once we get 10 people together with them and schedule them all to come in on a friday and we're talking about schedule earlier so we may need to have a schedule friday just for those folks that are coming to the health department to get jansen sure that would not be a problem here because you know uh the best part about this is that you can manage your schedule uh you know as for your needs so that would not be a problem for the days for the times or for even you know for a single vaccine that would not be a problem so once we go into the training part where i will walk you through on how you can you know create your schedules and how you can manage them and you will see that you know what i was actually talking about it will be pretty easy stuff for you okay awesome so uh moving forward uh i just have a few more things that i need to confirm on my end and then if i have missed something blake can take over from there so uh first part is your system require any updates to your billing group repairs that you currently have set up like uh your group and npi which you guys are using do you need any changes in that do you need any updation no no perfect alright and for the while we will be setting up your uh you know vms here we will be having an option to you know default defaulting the ordering slash administering provider so do you have any provider in your mind that you want to you know default for this particular you know education doctor prices who we typically bill under um for immunizations alright perfect and alright there's just one thing that uh would you like us to assist with all the billing all covered encounters based on cpt once the automation process is activated so tell me what does that mean well this will mean that you know for all the encounters other than the vms as well where you will have the cpt codes which are for encounters they will also be part of the automation and we will be submitting those uh you know we will be submitting claims with those encounters as well or you want us to simply go with the uh only the only the ones which actually are being taken care in the vms uh let me explain that to you jamie yeah okay so basically the automation that we have put in place it it works on the cpt code so we're gonna feed that cpt code that whenever uh cpt code for example for fizer 91300 and then you have uh you know the admin codes like 0001 a and then 0002a whenever these codes are used in a patient chart i mean for the vaccine administration it will trigger the automation so when you start using when we use the word vms basically what we will do is we will create a dummy provider excuse me we will create a dummy provider and with that dummy provider we will attach a billing provider to it so when the calendar is created that calendar you're currently using the resource base calendar is that correct yeah okay so that's the uh vms works in management system these calendars will be created under provider profile and that will be covered in uh you know the training the process is exactly the same apart from a very minor thing so instead of attaching the reason group you just have to choose the number of slots for a number of appointments per slot that you want to book that is why one of the questions that we asked earlier that how many appointments are the vaccines that you'll be administering in a day will give us an idea when we will prepare your dummy calendar you know for the training purposes and then we'll help you through that you know how to create and the the best thing about this is you can create when you are selecting the you know the number of uh bookings per slot you can create the uh calendar according to the number of slots that you want to really have for example if you don't want to cross the threshold of 200 appointments you can do that there's a way to manage that we will show you within our training what he's trying to say is that apart from the the provider that we will set up within the application would you be an administering vaccines you know with your regular resource based calendar as well or you're just gonna shift everything over through our automation so yes we will also have immunization clinic currently playing with our vaccine clinic okay great now the other part of this is um please help me understand that are you guys currently administering uh how many types of vaccines um i would say at least 40 45 no no no what i mean is that types in uh like pfizer moderna jensen are you doing all three of them yes we are okay so in order for you because you earlier mentioned that you when you get like 10 people lined up then you will put them you know on a particular day on the calendar so on friday right and and i believe that is for jensen only yes okay alright so help us understand and we will find a way best possible for you guys how would you like to how are you currently managing all three immunizations on the calendar what is the uh you know unique identify that tells you that this patient is for pfizer this version is for this one is for johnson how do you differentiate between the time between them when you say google sheet and so she has a column that has the patient's name and then column beside it with the drop down and it says moderna 1st 2nd does 1st 2nd does whether or not the patient and checked out that type of stuff alright i'm glad you said that now keeping this in mind we do have a flexible system right now what i mean by that is we can either we can do it two ways first thing is that we can create three uh dummy providers with the name johnson or advisor or moderna that's one way to do it or we can create three separate locations where the same dummy provider will be uh added and that way you can manage appointments through that so you decide which option is best for you guys either you want to do you want to add multiple locations you know to manage those appointments or do you want to add multiple dummy providers to manage those location providers is an easy option by the way to manage because then you can create the calendars of separately madonna separately and the uh jensen separately as well so you don't have to maintain the google sheet so we can't do on the same calendar on the same day you can do i mean that's not a problem that is not a problem you certainly can do that but i'm just trying to give you an option that would you like to have them separated no because right now we do like to pfizer 1st and 2nd dishes on the same day so yeah we can just put them on the same calendar but would you like to have jensen separate from the rest of the crowd uh so the the jansen would be separated because it would only be administered on fridays so there should be like a special resource for that one when they go so instead of special resource it will be a special provider provider yeah thank you yeah yeah so yeah we can certainly you know do that uh we will add a um you know uh dummy provider and then we go from there okay alright marcus sorry sorry go ahead please i had a cushion too so we'll be going live kind of in the middle of the month on june 22 those clients that we already have on our current legal sheet that our schedule mhm how do we get there demographic data into cure i think i can run a report from cvms that shows everybody that's already came in 21 days ago or 21 8 28 days ago will be coming back to us for their second dose and we can put those in the cure but what we do have an option yeah we will migrate all the existing well not the past appointment but the future appointments past you go live to the newly created calendar so you can manage all of that through the automation as well because if they came in in the past for their first of information the same we would just enter and cure that it was their second american geographic being being on the different scheduler will not affect the clinical data it will actually help you to uh administer them in a you know effective uh manner uh and faster as well right so really like if a person's checking in if we send that file to you guys everybody that's already been in for a first dose is coming back their data should be in there on the date of june 22 everybody that's coming in for a first desk we'd have to enter that demographic data yes that is correct so if you if you do want to have them over for you go alive the demographic data should be there first thing second thing is you just let us know that they need to be on the calendar you know we can migrate patients from a resource one resource calendar to another you know we do have the option to do that so we can help you migrate the appointments as well okay okay so what what type of format would you need that report and no you don't you just need to let us know the date which dates uh you know which date uh schedule uh we need to migrate yeah for uh for this purpose i can share the format the details uh you know in which formats you know you need to let us know that you want to migrate these appointments from this resource calendar on this particular date uh for you know so once we have those details with us i can certainly send this request to our technical team and they will be going ahead and you know migrating all those appointments so we will not be needing the patient level data we will just be needing an overview uh in that particular format once i will share it with you you will understand so you just need to let us know the few details and the rest of the things will be taken care by us okay so the data will be coming directly from c v m s because that's where we register and do all of our stuff now okay alright but those questions currently on your scheduler for the 2nd dose no okay so if you want to the google just their name and all the registration information is in c v m s okay in that case you just need to you know get them added in cure and then just let us know that these you know give us a list of the patients and let us know that these patients need to be on the scheduler for this date and we'll get them added okay i don't think i'm gonna be able to do that that way because but they don't have any unique identifiers in the google sheet no but we can get a report but that report isn't gonna match up with the google sheet there's there's no way to have like a patient's name with other demographic information that comes from cbms connected to how our schedule is set up well we can do all this appointment date like 21 days again so since they came in for their first step and have them automatically june 22 but they wouldn't come in at the times like times and everything would match up and they may not have been yeah i think we just have some stuff internally to work out because we don't have any unique identifiers tied to that google sheet and so i'm just not sure that we would be able to migrate it over the way that the way that we're talking about so i think we'll have to think about that a little bit well and i don't even know that we need to have them on there what do we need to have them on there i don't do that number well but if they're already in cvms if it's their second dose want their information just come up but not caring are we using share because i thought they were i thought there was an interface between the two not until we start not until we start okay that's okay alright sorry we just have some logistical stuff to work through sure not a problem i mean alright so i think that's pretty much it from my end i have pretty much everything that i need you uh need the details on to set up the vaccine management system on my end and blake if there is anything else that you want to confirm you can go ahead and do that um i think that's pretty much it okay so do you want to cover the ip addresses part uh i did share those some of the i p s and an email which i sent to jamie uh actually did have been what can i think i've just sent you another sheet can you just send it over to jamie again and just get that white listed as well and uh yeah sure and i think if i'm not wrong maybe give me one second maybe i need to add maybe maybe in addition to this we might just add one or two more ip addresses so but yeah if you just get these white listed then we will start the process on our end to check you know if the server is communicating with our server you know for everything so yeah okay that sounds all right i can do that all right awesome so uh yeah i will be sending you an email which will which will contain all of the minutes of meeting that we just discussed and i will attach the ip list in that email as well alright okay and is there anything else i need to work on on my end that i haven't already done um not that i think of um you just need to work on these i p s that we are going to share with you and the other part will be the appointment migration process on how you want to you know take care of that these are the two things that are pending on your end that's that's about it that will work on the logistics of that alright awesome then i will be sure to send you the minutes of meeting email before the end and you can add anything that if i have missed anything in it so uh i guess that's pretty much it and once we are done setting up your process i will again communicate with you on to you know let us know your availability for the you know uh training part so that we can conduct the training and we can walk you through the workflow of our vaccine management system okay that sounds great awesome so that's about it for today guys okay alright thank you thank you no problem uh we wish you the same as well jamie and tanya have a nice weekend bye bye bye bye bye bye bye"}}, {"id": 1041, "data": {"call_id":

who did this all right sure let me confirm you the appointment were deleted because the scheduler was removed so uh that's the reason why uh the appointment you know uh were not available and it was it was done by santana jessica what time uh yesterday two pm yesterday two p.m. so what exactly uh actually the scheduler was removed because of which the appointments were not you know uh shown on the scheduler and all i did is that i created a scheduler for the the specific date and all of the appointments are now back on no no that's okay but what exactly did she do she removed herself uh the scheduler for the day was removed for the day what do you mean for the day i mean for today and the other tuesday as well for all the users should remove yourself as a scheduler for all the tuesdays that's correct so i have put back the scheduler and everything is working fine now okay do me a favor can you please just restrict her access uh from creating the scheduler listen i i don't know whether she did this on purpose or she's a new hire okay i don't know whether she did it on purpose or whether she just doesn't know how to do uh whatever she's doing and uh i you know for now i just need to restrict her access no problem let me do that right away for you cannot touch the schedule sure i understand that give me one moment let me do that right away i'm driving right now i don't know what i'm going to do with her whether i'm going to like say you know what it's not working out you know we tried you for two weeks it's not working out she used to be with me she used to work for me and then uh you know and then uh basically she was um you know she was away for one whole year and so then i brought her back as my employee she used to be an employee of another company uh to help me on thursdays so i felt that she knew the work and you know she used to actually work my cure md so why would schedule for tuesday right now actually uh from what i understand from this is that while making the change in the scheduler she might have deleted the scheduler for the work you open a scheduler for a specific day and then book appointment for that day if the scheduler is removed the appointment still remain on that day so all we you are saying she removed herself as the scheduler not herself the scheduler from the practice like you see there was no scheduler available for june 1st 2021 that's today so the scheduler for today was removed and because of that all the appointments were not available so what i did i just created a scheduler for today and for the next tuesday and all of the appointments which were not you know shown on the scheduler are now back available on the scheduler are they back for like for the next one year or whatever well pretty said that she wanted for today and for the next uh tuesday that is no no no no we have patients schedule all the way for a whole year on tuesdays yeah on tuesday no worries appointment i would i would go to the next 1.5 year and and open up the schedule for every tuesday mhm i'll do that for you don't worry about that let me but rather let me just do that right away and make sure that it's done give me one moment the only thing is we're gonna need to get some instruction on this because clearly i don't know if this girl did this by purpose i mean i don't think she would do it by purpose right that's exactly what i think as well i mean why would she just delete the schedule probably she was not updated on that and might have you know done it by accident but but here's the thing um so first and foremost opened up my so we had we had actually blocked uh what is the 15th visitor tuesday 15th june that is tuesday and that is blocked okay so that's blocked and we opened up the friday before that the friday that is 11th june yes we want to open that for cornwall instead and see we pretty and i don't know how to work this well i mean i don't i i after so many years of having cure md i still don't know how to like you know block the schedule or open up another schedule we need instruction on this a s a p because otherwise you know like like okay so she she you know we used to work my cure m d but then you know it's possible that she didn't know how to do something and that's how this thing got knocked up but uh i want to make sure that we all understand so can you open up the same scheduled for us for the friday before which is the 11th i think right sure i can definitely do that and that is 11th june also also july in july is the 13th that uses uh if you can just allow me to create the scheduler for the friday first just to make sure that it's done correctly give me one moment and i'm doing that right away alright that is 11th alright the friday is open but i don't see any appointments over there i know we're gonna we're gonna start doing appointments sure so now the june for the june and july till six july all the tuesdays are open and uh apart from 15th which you have blocked and that is because you're on vacation for that day i'm on vacation on uh yeah i'm gonna be a way that uh tuesday you say the what that is 15th june okay tuesday the 15th june okay yeah so that should be blocked that's blocked already 12 can you just tell me from the 12th the 12th june is uh saturday um so the 11th would be friday friday okay yeah so i'm not sure if i will be able to do that friday um how about for now making it the friday after i can do that as well so we're like around the 12 you know like one or two days before one or two days after i'm sorry what is the 12th again it is saturday 12 to saturday so that means if i yeah it's gonna be hard for me to do friday before so how about doing friday after july 15 june 15 or july 15 we're done with june now we are done with june alright so in july 2021 for saint lukes cornell hospital location only the 6th july is open for now and you have 11 appointments on sixth of july i i know but i need to block the tuesday around like okay now when i first talked to you were you making changes on the june or july schedule uh now while i'm talking to you i just opened up 11th june because you mentioned that he wanted to open the 11th june we're gonna open up uh wait a minute 11th no no no not the 11th uh i'm gonna be away from the sixth to the 10th of june 6th 10th of june mhm so so uh which day uh do we have locked on the sixth alright let me confirm you the sixth is sunday there's no schedule available seventh is monday there's no schedule available 8th is tuesday you have 13 appointments for that day the ninth and tenth there is no schedule available which are wednesdays and thursdays and then you requested to open the friday that is before 15th of june that is 11th so i opened up the 11th june that is friday for you do i have blocked the tuesday before the 11th of june no which tuesday do i have locked in june 15th i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm gone from the 10th to the 16th i'm sorry i'm just like i'm driving i'm just no problem no no one second i am gone between the 10th and the 16th so i guess the tuesday in between would be 15th 15th right and it is blocked it is blocked ah for friday before that is what the 11th mhm the 11th of june its friday i cant do that because i'm going from the 10th to the 16th mhm so should i remove the scheduler for for 11th yeah yeah we don't have anybody that day right no yeah you don't have any appointments on that um so it will have to be the friday after which is what give me one moment let me just change that right away so the friday after 15th is 18th listen i'm gonna get cut off because i'm going through a dead zone so if i get cut off could you please call me back in two three minutes sure no problem i can how about you getting you know on your destination and i give you a call back because i don't feel nice that you're driving and you have to you know give time to me so if you want i can give you a call after sometime when you reach on your destination so that i'm gonna have patients waiting do me a favor open up my entire schedule for tuesday for the next one and a half years sure i'll do that right away uh sorry you got off a little on there uh do you want me to open the scheduler for the 18th that is the friday after 15th no today today what is my first patient schedule for today give me one moment for this end that is for to okay give me one it's it was at 10 am um tell them okay okay that's fine alright so so now let's go back to please open up my entire schedule for saint lukes cornwall for one for the next 1.5 years sure i alright so it will start from july 13 alright give me one moment let me open up for you mhm what should be the start and the end time off for the schedule uh it's always 10-6 10 to 6 alright so doctor bola your schedule is now open for tuesdays and all the appointments are back on your schedule so it is now available till july 2022 make it even yeah i don't think we we went beyond that but just can you take a look just make it like another six months more i can do that i can open up for the whole year as well the whole year of 20 2022 sure so it is for now available til july no july 12th 2022 let me make it from july 19th 2022 till one year july 19th you can you can just make it for until the end of until december 2022 sure alright dr bola now all your tuesdays till the end of 2022 are open for dimension location that is st luke's cornwell hospital okay now can you please just go back and uh so what what do we restrict for jessica santana because i'm not sure if i'm gonna keep her so i don't want to like do she can she can book patients she can schedule patients but she cannot do anything with the schedule let me see what i can do about that okay so just temporarily block her like block her for now because i have to talk to her and i'm i'm gonna be seeing patients i don't have the time to talk to her so i'm going to this by mistake then you know it's understandable but um you know obviously she's gonna need gonna need to set the cure md get like the whole training all over again sure no problem what i can do for you is i can restrict her access for cure m d that is by inactivating her uh user profile and if you would like to you know activate that again we can definitely go ahead and you know activate the profile just the way it was before can you can you just like restrict her from uh do you want me to mark her profile as inactive like completely inactive like she won't even be able to go in you mean yeah she will not be able to log on to the cure md application okay how about we just restrict her like schedule uh you want me to restrict her from the scheduler so that she can not make any changes but just book patients for the appointments yes yeah we can definitely do that as well no problem alright so for scheduler or let let me confirm you what permission she has she can change block schedule she can change calendar partially and she can do a forced booking first booking okay just let her do the first booking that's it uh the change calendar partially option is taken off and change block scheduler is taken off as well so now the unblock slot from scheduler yeah she should be able to unblock a slot from the scheduler no no no no no no i only want i don't want to do anything with the schedule i only wanted to be able to do the first uh like to book a patient so the only option from the scheduler that she now has is a forced booking yes exactly and that is i guess fine because of the reason if there is a block schedule and she can do a forced booking alright i have made the required changes and now she i mean she would not be able to make any changes to the scheduler just booking the appointments on the scheduler correct correct okay i'm getting another call from potential spam see when you guys call back it shows up as potential scam spam uh i am not sure about that but probably uh if you receive frequent calls from one number uh your phone or the carrier or the your telephone operator marks it like that so uh if you can save this number with cure md's name so probably would not show up like that it doesn't okay i'll i'll i'll look into that later no problem so we've got the schedule all opened up and now the last thing was do we have the tuesday between the 10th and 16 june isn't blocked uh the the tuesday between the 10th and 16 june is it blocked it is blocked okay what is the 10th what which which day of the week is 10th is it thursday it's thursday yes okay so why don't you why don't you then open up saint lukes cornwall open up the friday after which is uh the friday after the that is 18th yeah the 18th of june yeah sure i can do that i had put down i had to try to open up the 11th but you know i'll be away on the 11th mhm that's perfectly alright we can definitely you know open up the 18th for you so let me do that so it's saint lukes that is they get cut off any minute so also now for july for july just make sure i'm blocked off uh uh like maybe two days before the 12th and two days after the 12th of july so that would be from like the 10th to the 14th so what tuesday give me just one moment please listen if we get cut off please call me back sure sure no problem i will definitely call you back all right so the friday that is after 15th uh of june is

you uh requested to open more space on schedule to add more patients oh yes it was for the order nomick test instead of it has you know when you open it ask you how many people you want to ask for that particular day i had it allowed if i think six i wanted us to open it freely so i can schedule anybody anytime i see uh well tiffany would it be uh possible if we could have any desk session that i can have a better idea okay hopefully it works for me this time what's your name here okay eh okay my access number is (287) 425 27 217 sorry that's okay i have (287) 425 217 sending an invitation okay go ahead do you have it yes i can see okay i'm gonna go to resources um i'm on the phone you can take care of it and tell us you can bring what she likes so that she could bring whatever she likes wonderful and i can't answer up okay it's for the economic nerve test 12 45 okay i'm gonna click it you see how on yes 12 on um friday a colonial um put how many 123456 if i try to add another person it won't allow me to you see i'm adding myself it won't allow me to put me in for the test i just want to have a whole access so i could put unlimited amount um of testing there on there this mode economic okay you see it won't allow me because it's already full on that one i don't know why you just open it do you want to try adding another one okay let me do it for this one it was the 4th 123411 okay hello yes hello we got cut off okay yeah because on on friday i couldn't add to take mister filipov to put another one in and place him back let me see can i put him back this is for friday okay so this slot is particularly booked but you can try adding him to a different slot okay see is saying it's not allowing me so i guess after i go over e i mean on that particularly seven it won't allow me to add and the other one so i just want to be able to add unlimited just give me one moment yeah mhm he says can i schedule more than four patients but it's playing the reasons excuse me so uh is is this what you wanted to do like to be able to add more patients i was able to yeah to be able to um add uh so i mean obviously you can just add like uh one patient for that 15 minute time slot uh keeping that in mind you can add as many patients as you want you can you know as long as it's a 15 minute duration yes it's within that you know there's obviously gonna be a limited number overall but uh you can utilize that okay okay alright so uh okay so are you able to uh add or the appointments now um i'm about to see now let me see can i bring him over so which date do you want to reschedule them for on the fourth and so let's see what time slots do we have available on the fourth so they can reschedule them there okay so i'm gonna do the 1015 one okay let me check this one out every 15 okay allow me to perfect okay more than four you see you can read it right it says you cannot schedule more than four patients for this appointment reason in one day okay so for that particular reason that you're assigning them so it could be a different reason so are they all being scheduled for the same thing they're all being scheduled for the same um the same tests i just don't want to have the six slots available i want to be able to do 8 9 10 they all right so that you don't want to have a limit for that reason basically okay so let me let me see if i have that right yeah those are the specials that's why okay you said that's the reason why yeah these are the specialist that's why okay so with that they all be open how you doing well he changed whatever time he wants that's what he changes okay let me see can i redo it uh reschedule yes it is i'll put you in for 12:00 thank you see you later allow me i don't know alright tiffany how about we go on june fourth and see which time slots are available i'll let you know so yes so we have okay yeah so it shows on that list right so when we're trying to do it okay so you did it on a big test but you put you put a different but yeah yeah but this was over there so this is taking time for 1245 and one for 15 so we can remove this this one okay let's remove this if you can go ahead and move this okay so add it okay mhm yeah he's dropping off he said that one was she just redid it yeah so give it to her and go tell her now so she could do it because he was here already he waited more than enough time you wait like two months for it okay let me see if i can put it for the that's why that's taken let me reach yours i'm gonna take the 115 off on my um can i edit it reschedule and if i could put it there then i'm gonna put it there okay sorry tiffany you talk to me yes yes okay i'm gonna put it i'm gonna try to put him on the 1 15 let's let's see what happens i think it went through i'm about to see now uh 1 15 okay no it's still more than the same thing yeah what what what is the reason that we're alloting for that patient no it's for anybody i just don't want to schedule for people uh we do more we do 8 to 10 people but that's not what i'm saying though it's saying that you cannot schedule more than four patients for this appointment reason so like when we're because i had put i had put a time check on it i want you to remove that i had them to do it like that because it was overbooking now that we getting more people we need to open it back up so it was something that the guy clicked on that allow us just to say six people that's it but that's not the number it's not that you can only uh have six people uh no no he went he actually said how many you want to schedule for that and it'll be locked unlock it so that i do on my regular schedule i can schedule all the way from 8 to 8 again so so what you're saying right now is the schedulers not allowing you to have more than six patients being scheduled per day yes on that one on this resource for the economic nerve study okay we can we can check that so this is a resource so let's try adding one over here okay test appointment reason okay so so you kept selecting this pattern holter uh no we're not doing passholder it's automatic go down go down more it's the autumn nomick go down some more down some more right here auto nomick go up this one no no go up some more no go down it's it's a couple of them there's different ones you can do order like it's the nerve test let me see things are difficult because there's so many of one here do the auto pseudo some people do auto auto 10 okay so and the date uh what's the date that's being showed here so it's over there once you open it you on friday the 21st okay so let's go ahead and schedule this okay so it's gonna allow you because there's not a lot of people there that's why it's gonna allow you but when it's a whole bunch of like how many um i think it's over seven seven so yeah so we wouldn't do eight we try to do eight everything let's let's troubleshoot to see if we can do more than eight right now uh so let's just go quick okay alright okay have a good day well just added you know a different reason just to see if we can schedule more than eight people so that's 234 56 another one it's saying science let's see so what you here for no you know you have to do it in the morning it's from 9 to 11 but you have a regular appointment anyway today okay so we have uh eight patients scheduled right now this is the 9th one and this one should go through as well hopefully let me see okay i'll tell you what exactly you're not able to try to move him because he has to go on the fourth because he did his test that day mr phillips okay definitely let me explain you what that editor basically saying what the editor is saying is that you know you see that reason this thing over here so you cannot select suppose i select this one now i cannot select the same reason more than four times on a particular day does that make sense yeah but i understand but for this testing it will be eight of those automatic testing listing there that's what i want it has to be eight because everything what you did is not what's for that resource that resources for autonomick testing and auto pseudo i understand put in the 6 10 to 6 yeah so that that's gonna pop up but for this test i need to click on that because that's what they're getting the authorization for uh sorry i don't quite understand that uh so so basically uh what you were saying initially everybody that's gonna be on the schedule if i want to schedule eight everybody's gonna say auto automatic testing eight is not going to be 10 am 10 is for everybody that's being tested for that day at the patient name but what they coming here for so that's not what's showing up when you're trying to do it at your end no it's just giving me that thing you can schedule more than okay so uh let's just go on this thing over here so now i see so oh it should be calling him now can you see how far is the new patient what's his last name gordon okay for me thank you so what's the patient that you wanna add on it's on um june 25 phillips and what time do you want him to schedule for 12:30 oh this is for any time i just want to put him on schedule next or new patients should not be waiting this long they go from isn't that idea i just ordered how on my talk student actually i was talking about last week they're calling you ma'am you have to transfer to the person that um transfer talk to the person that put them on d j whoever's in two years i didn't switch it you cant switch it right uh i'm not trying to reschedule i'm trying to just trying to schedule them uh manually but uh the name is not even showing up in the system so if i try to search him first name is other news date of birth will be quicker let me just go to the date of birth um the date of birth is 56 58 and if we could get it that way then i put the authorization to myself i just want to get him on okay so it's gone june 4th let's say 5 6 okay well i think i was just entering in one l instead of two probably that's okay i say this it was 58 oh yeah 58 oh gosh let's see yeah there you go how's the point would you like to let me see does this have to be very specific okay the reason itself yeah the reason itself here hold on for me 1 second hold for me so let me see er will you allow me allow me that i just know why is he oh boy you can ask for more than four patients for this appointment reason in one day please select another reason to continue scheduling okay let me just take a screenshot of this it's crazy that's the new patient i just took a screenshot of this i'm gonna consult this with my team and i'll just get back to you okay okay thank you so much you're welcome talk to you soon okay bye bye bye"}}, {"id": 1047, "data": {"call_id":

apply $10 and yess just the thing was his appointment was about four days ago and i'm pretty sure that i applied the payment i just don't see it so you this was the appointment where you took payment right yeah and did you apply this payment to this appointment or any other appointment um to his his most recent appointment the 10th he just had a $5 copay but for some reason it's coming at 10 on applied yeah let's see the charge yeah i was trying to work on it yesterday but i didn't have much luck see the other applied that was recorded for $10 uhuh right here so and it was not applied if you go into the payment section okay click this little error right next to his name it will give you all elements that was posted against his name so there's no $10 so i think i erased it because i was trying to erase any additional maybe yeah so there's no payment let's just delete this as well because see this is the payments so you can apply the $10 if you like you can go ahead and apply $10 right over here right click click on the blue section allocate from unapplied yeah now put in $10 now there was no copay see there was no copay recorded on the charges due to which this is coming up as credit balance towards the patients in order to open open the balance you have to enter the copay amount as well on the charge page okay put in $10 and check the page section let me do the copay once again just slide we didn't have to actually check the i think the the copay was applied twice originally and i think that's what started causing all these issues okay let's do something delete this unapplied and record this $10 of the copay i'll take a picture so how much did the patient paid actually it was a $5 copay $5 so i just deleted that unapplied okay because you actually received $5 so i uh deleted the uh unapplied now we will just enter the $5 because that is the actual amount that patient paid and that you received right yes yes we entered $5 right here and you can change the dates as well for the payments if you like okay okay so now we are good good good okay okay perfect thank you so much youre welcome have a great day alright you too"}}, {"id": 1056, "data":

again is abigail still available or no alright give me one quick moment let me put you on a brief hold and let me check thank you for holding i'm connecting you with okay thank you you're welcome hi this is abigail yeah abigail this is me again nawaz hey what's up uh i think it's just uh some smart monitor so can i give you the anydesk number first sure please 875 613 hold on for a 2nd yeah 875 613 662 thank you okay so two quick things one thing is let me show you so i'm in a test patient right now mm i go this is our annual template for the annual new patient visit right mhm and what did that work did you see physical exam you have all these okay yeah but these are not there in the follow up visit template what's not their physical exam yeah physical exam is there but all these options are not there let's go to the physical exam template in the same patient like this is sort of right mhm because it is going to pull up his physical exam over from the previous note so whatever is added in the previous notes will show here so but they didn't so they can not add change that they can click on it and change how how can you tell me one example any live patient lets see what happens there click on it and then you can make the changes you can change the physical exam but for let me show you actually this is uh this is a test patient yeah so that is why it is pulling physical exam from the previous note right okay that's why i go to see one live patient sure i'll i'll give you control i don't know which one is there but let's see this one the government so he came here two times so this was the first one right first visit so that's just physical exam yeah now when you will create a follow up notes for this station this physical example pull over let's go to follow up like this is follow up okay so now if they want to make any changes to this follow up what will happen all you do is that was the question what the question is that okay so since now all those things that are showing that they want to make changes to the physical now how they will do sure so what they will do is this is a follow up note right but this is a signed note yeah that's the one they cant make changes on a signed note no no no one after that okay let's see i picked that patient because i knew that he came twice but this is a bad example because the first one is not created yet yeah this is this is this is a good example so this is physical exam and if they want to make any change to where they can click on it can you click on it yeah but here is fine but then in follow up okay how it's going to be exactly the same this example pull over they can click on it and make changes i'm gonna do it on the no if you want to test then uh i can mhm yeah i want to test with one is one not signed and the second one signed because here everything is there everything is gonna pull over from the first note because here is nothing is science everything is showing up in the just to so all they have to do click physical and make changes and then it is up there okay but it's the exact same physical that you follow new patient that's all okay i'll show it to them then okay if you want to create a scenario hold on a second if you want to create a test patient scenario then the best way to do is it's gonna be a little bit time consuming but i'll show you how is day going so far so far very well actually honestly okay is doctor shazia calmed yes she did all the patients and she was having these two things came again this is probably the this part of the application that's why she said check with her because she can exactly add the same thing from the new patient physical example follow up so it looks like everything is there it's just that they have to yeah but you can still um have some hands on by recreating it let me delete these notes it's i'm almost there it will also clear the clutter they're all 23 test notes yeah actually we have too many tests patients too we need to remove those i dont know how to do it oh so i don't know how to do it oh okay so this is our advent note let's say this is our first note and do we have physical exam no we don't let's create one yeah the start lets create a new note from scratch so once we create a new note from scratch let's say it's a new patient visit visit reason is like let's say whatever and it creates okay and then physical exam will automatically pull over like this so these are the default options okay if you wanna make any change you can click on it let's say you wanna take this off or maybe under breast you can mark this is normal add something and accept it and then when you save it now when you add another one which is a follow up note it creates oh sorry oh we can create two notes at the same time so after some time lakey okay let's make it to 24 hit create now the follow up visit will pull over the physical exam from previous as you can yeah exactly what that sucks let me check what went wrong is it me it's not pulling the right exam right no mm oh it is sorry my bad so the physical exam that we added previously it's the same one that pulled over vital test as an example so it's the same one that's gonna pull over from the admin note but this one is soul so this is your first note right yes this is coming from the first note even though we did not do anything with the rest of the stuff no i didnt why it's not showing up on that goodman station like this let's open the patient let's see every patient can have a separate a different scenario yeah yeah this one so this is the first one right okay yeah this is the first one oh this is the second one it's it's not the same one yeah let me check can i take control yeah oh that's why yeah there was one setting that was off now that would be started for everybody or just for me mm for everybody this one is not um specifically users okay no i just want to make sure they don't come back you know what i mean i know i know so if you want to fix this there is a way to do that but i think that it's yeah you can un sign it and then fix it otherwise otherwise now we see the test unless you another patient right now yeah i got can i close this yeah oh shit sorry i don't remember patient came two times let's check let's check this one 25 just give me a minute this one pulled over no this is the first reason okay go ahead i'll give you the control no problem you can you want to create a new one for this patient okay so this patient has two notes one was 4 2 and one is 4 16 you have the control sure thank you 4 16 was yesterday right so no not yesterday uh what's wrong with me um i think this was already changed so this is way different than the first one okay let me let me explain something so i have made the setting now so the notes that you're going to create from this point onwards they'll have that functionality okay okay so there okay no the second thing yeah the front so is the front doctor does not want her name because she said it's a r n p is giving the referral so it should not say that referred by doctor is there any way we can change that or no over here no let's go to test patient because i don't want to touch this note goes on then this a test patient let's do referrel here what exactly that means you want to do it mm yeah so go i need to go to anything we got to do that mm mm okay yeah so she does not want her name here but somebody has to reffer mm the thing is is there anything to do the practice name practice can we do practice name mhm it's um it's always going to pick the name of the provider let me show you uh i have one more thing yeah so here at some place i saw that you can select but here you can ask okay so tell me what we can do sorry so i was thinking oh we should take this off and we can give you referred by humanity cardiologist in the area that's what you need right yeah but yeah referred to by humanity cardiology whatever so it should say so over here over here i can give you a drop down for all the specialties would that work let me check with them first because i don't want them because it will become too clutter or no it will look like this hold on i think i have an option to it it's just gonna be dropped down thats it it's gonna be it's not going to say mhm and then over here there we have a drop down to choose from so at one time you'll just see one specialty not all of them okay mm i i can't give you a sample because if i give you a sample then it will be yeah yeah i know i know so its not gonna say reffered by doctor to cardiology then you don't have to use this flag at all you'll be using it this one all you have to do is everything will remain the same you'll just have you'll just click on the drop down and select the right specialty okay and that any reference physician that we have that we can select it from this drop down our specialities uh as per doctor doctor shazia you don't want the person or the name of the specialist you just want the specialty name if you want the doctor's name then you can either type or you can use the referral option but then if you choose the referral option it's gonna ask who's who's the who's the doctor who referred to it's not gonna give the name of the location it's gonna give the name of the doctor as referred by okay okay so can i get back to you on this one monday i'll drop your email so that abigail does change to this referred by humanity to yeah you can ask which one do you want which which work flows better yeah definitely that she doesn't want her name there because she said i'm not saying like nurse practitioners in patients it should mm because this looks like that she is the one who has seen the patient referred to them actually she's just a supervising position okay sure let me know then and what about the pharmacies yeah so but i was thinking this pharmacy comes make a list and send you i don't know right now it's very tough to make a list without going okay sure i'll i'll wait for as soon as the list is ready i'll wait for the email so it will be like same issue will be instead of this referred by humanity and then from there you can do the drop down yeah like right now we do drop down here it will be the same drop down over there it's like this it will show up like um when you click 2 referred to and then you have to select these are the options that you will see in the drop down okay okay but layout is not gonna change there will be the same thing they have to go from here okay so let me check and drop your email all right sure thank you thank you bye bye bye"}}, {"id": 1060, "data": {"call_id": "1622835498.13132.txt", "text": "empire medical may i help you hi this is phil calling from cure m d am i

your database so it took me some time um now we'll discuss every single issue like um and i will help you resolve all the issues uh and um the thing is the first issue which i can see in your emails is that the copay is not transferred to the patient automatically it's going to the next responsible to the next insurance no these these patients don't have a second insurance they just have the two that i found and there may be more out there but these are two i found they only have the insurance they don't even have a second insurance so the balances should be going over to them but it's not it's leaving the balances on their account over the insurance company didn't pay i do have one um so another one i found the patients who does have medicare and is a secondary and after medicare paid it sent the the 20% that should have gone to ghi is already showing his patient responsibility it's like it skipped ghi at all so i don't know if ghi is the problem but there's also it's a weird thing

right off it will change to green and then click save once you click save you will see that you have written off that very uh e r a which was denied so you do not have to post it again but it's still showing up top we'll we'll fix it i'm actually uh i'm actually following up every single step so we yeah no problem over here do you see that there is nothing posted yes so it's we can delete it as well we'll consider it as a dummy posting because nothing is posted inside anything with a zero it's safe to delete anything with no numbers yes okay so okay there is one more mistake which i can find right now let me first check the patient's profile if the patient has how many just to check how many so the single insurance so i'm going back into the payment and to the same payment posting over here okay let's see okay now you see when you entered the payment the next responsible did not appear as patient uh but these were those an auto post you know when you just click the little thing so i know there were problems with it that is what i'm going to check as of right now in my system that why it didn't went directly to the next responsible so let me check sure thank you uh let me save this first and then can you bear with me of course i can check the settings please stay online i may have to hold no problem thank you okay i'm back uh let me check a couple of things that why it didn't went directly to the makes responsible okay okay uh let me look into my system again sure just stay online uh thank you for staying online sure okay now the thing is that um during the training session i told you that when will when you will receive a denial and you will post it now according to the logics the denial is an open balance right yes okay now when the balance is open it's on the insurance end correct yes so when you posted this denial because there was only one cbd which was denied so it was appearing as the the insurance's responsibility because it was a denied code okay so once you posted a denial there's an open balance and the system is considering that you will be appealing the denial and the responsible one for the uh for uh to to look into the denial is the insurance not the patient so that's why the next responsible was insurance okay okay so when i changed uh when i when i write off the c p t then uh i will also have to i will also have to change the responsible uh next responsible let me revert the changes which i made just to show you how to fix it now the situation uh before it was like this denial and g h i safe so before the situation was something like this correct um yeah there's a denial and uh you haven't written it off and the next responsible is appearing as planned next responsible i'm sorry in the posting so in order to fix it you need to go into the european posting 1st you need to uh my system froze i guess is your system working correctly um i see um yeah mine mine is moving let me see what is happening let me send you the request again sure have you received the request uh no it's like something flashed and then went away let me i'm gonna go totally out of it and do it and open it again okay so 5270 got it this time ok i have the number okay okay i can see the screen okay now in order to fix it you need to go into your frame and posting first you will select the denied code is right off from here you need to change anything else then you need to change the next responsible to the patient okay okay so once you click save it's all settled now the patient has an unapplied balance do you want to apply this unapplied balance to this $4 patient responsibility yes okay uh can you show me how to do it okay mm you know why i think a lot of the write off that i've had have been with like say we called the annual exam where there's never a copay there's never a patient responsibility or anything else so that's why this issue wasn't really showing up this is one of the more unusual instances where we're writing something off and there's still a copay due so that's why i think i wasn't seeing this this issue earlier on yeah we are actually during over during our you know uh training sessions uh seth actually advised us to you know come up with something to write off uh the thing at the upfront we are actually in discussion with the development team to come up with some some sort of workflow which can help you to write off all the you know remark codes in a single click i hope that will help you on daily basis so i just i just want to request you to kindly bear with us like cure md is here to help you and we will ease your workflow but you you have to trust us and you have to give us some time i understand i'm i'm actually i'm actually working on it and i've been receiving emails all day for your practice from many departments and i'm actually actually working on it i may not be able to respond you timely but i assure you that i'm actually working on it okay no i i you you know this is the first time i think that i've had to email you guys directly and could not have responded faster i don't you know i know you're you can always email me the thing is i want to assure you that we are actively working on your concerns oh i i know i i know because i'm i'm very worried about it because uh you have like you have reported a lot of uh you know uh concerns which we need to work on and i am working on those like my boss and he has there are different things he has to he's more responsible for i'm i'm the the worker bee i'm entering the claims i'm doing the payments so i'm seeing things differently than him um it's easier for me because there is there are so it's so detailed and so different from what i'm used to um i know you're working on stuff and when i'm sending you the emails it's not saying that i'm rushing you it's just almost easier for me to keep track of some of the different situations to do it that way so understand it is totally understandable but the thing is that transition i understand that transition is not easy like every single time uh you you you were working on carrier first and now you're at cure md but once your workflows are uh like easy uh and you you have hands on practice you will know that cure md is a lot better than carry you that i can assure you because i can understand every other software has an edge and on that edge they sell their software mhm so there will be differences there will be the the good things best things and there will be some areas in which we need to work on and we are actually willing to work on those areas other mind not uh i don't know about that but we will uh and is there any other thing which i can help you with as of right now um can i try for the second patients where they had the same situation can i see if we can yes please did i wanna do that or did i wanna go back 1 1 screen back should i click on the payments again click on arrow okay let me check okay yes click on the date yes now as you can see the amount it was already written off but the next responsible wasn't changed that's what i need to i'm making myself a big note to watch next responsible okay so that's what i need so that's how we transfer the balance of yourself okay otherwise for the copays for specifically the copays there's a setting on the back end but the copay will be transferred to the next responsible so there's a whole hierarchy over here let's say the patient has like three insurances primary secondary and tertiary so if the patient hasn't paid you the copay that copay uh will be transferred to the next responsible after the surgery it will be transferred to the patient there is one setting the other setting is that we can directly transfer the copay to the patient right yeah so it's your choice as of right now it's transferring to the next responsible yeah no it should be uh next responsible so here's where one of those the situation so this you can see what my screen okay so kerry beleskey she has medicare and she has her secondary and for the first date she was in on may 13 um we just got the medicare payment the other day but it's already showing 2094 to patient responsibility when actually that should be ghis her secondary click on the click on the payment payment from left yeah click on the small error okay click on the date okay so all right oh there's a reason behind it can you go back to the charge page you can go back from here as well from the top sorry uh click on the appointment date okay let me take the control i'll tell you what is happening over here when you submitted the claim at that moment ghi was added in the system or not it was she's she's an old patient she's been with us all that information came over from carrie oh so it was definitely in there already okay let me check yeah i see it like seconds on the bottom line and i looked at the i was able to find the medicare remittance and it does show the um p with the little see i think next to it to me to cross over okay well you should have cancelled the g h i automatically hm uh let me check in my system why this happened let me put you on a short hold okay okay thank you for staying online sure well i just tested in your practice database i have deleted the payment posting which you did okay now if we go back to the remittance advice section it will be there can you please show me how are you posting the payments i need to find the one i always i mean this perspective but i always look just to see what it says first then go back to the pending and then click in the box and either from here or here 6 1 was the date um we can change it we can change it let's go back to the patient account now it is transferred no no no no no no no no i don't need to do that okay let me tell you how we can do the the payment date change the thing is if you click over here on the appointment date it will consider that you're posting a new payment if you want to make an edit on the previous plan posting then you need to go into the previous payment posting which is over here okay so you can change the date over here which it was 6 1 okay so if i save it it won't forced a new payment it will just added the previous payment and as you can see believe me i haven't changed anything in your practice database uh i don't know why that happened there there is a reason why that happens actually but according to the work flow through which you have posted the payment you didn't use that feature there was a problem i don't know if you're aware of it um last week you know first of all we we were not receiving any remittances for about 10 days and then we got a whole lot of them at one time which was okay it was fine but the little um like we chose a p for primary secondary those weren't there and the posting button was not working so what i was doing and i think i got you know we had to do it in the edit things so that's probably why these all got the work flow through which they're responsible doesn't come up okay correct and so the thing is the thing is there was some reconfiguration issue uh so uh the thing is that when you reported it you were you were the first guys who actually reported it so because a few people uh nobody else faced this issue so the thing is we just reconfigured it and then you uh you started posting the payments as normal so that was the thing okay so it was just that one day unfortunately they were like 100 and something claims so that's why i'm having these problems but it will probably not happen again so okay good so and um uh is there anything else i can help you with because i need to discuss one more thing with you but after i answer all your questions okay um just doing more question here so this has happened once before and i don't remember how he fixed it this um pink line it's it's also it's a medicare crossover one and there is some of the codes that denied and again it's the ones i go back and i write it off but then it creates i guess what they called the unbalanced c o b so why why does it do that is there anyway because it just it just gets i know it's not causing a problem but it annoys me understand there's a way to fix it the system is telling you that there's an unbalanced coordination of benefits which means that the primary payment posting is slightly incorrect so if you face this issue in the future if you need to go into the patient's account once you go into the payment uh patients account going to billing payment and then this is your hand posting and this is the payment posting over here now do you see that you have posted the payments twice it will create an unbalanced c o b because if i open this particular where you written off the single cpd which i guess open this posting you didn't entertain one cpd you see that a lot but no paid no transfer no copay it splits those it sends us medicare sends us the zero payments separately from the actual payments so that's why these keep getting up that's medicare's fault yeah they'll be separate understandable so what we can do is we let me check this payment posting as well mhm so you didn't get any remittance for the cpd and we always we always will get the zero ones and then a week later or something like that we get where they pay the actual code so i don't know they've always done it that way we always get them split like that so that's just that's a stupid medicare thing so the thing is no actually let me delete this first because you were about to write off that code right the 2nd 1 yes the one i wrote you yes let me write that off you are now waiting for the primary insurance to pay for the first c p d correct correct okay i will suggest you to save it as it is okay you should keep the next responsible as medicare over here because you're waiting for the responsible uh because you're waiting for the primary insurance to pay for the first cpt so simply save it in the payment section you will still see that the balance is open at the medicares end okay perfect and once you receive the e r a from the medicare rather than posting a new payment okay you should go back over here and you can address this balance over here but there is going to be an electronic remittance okay that's not going to be a paper paper there's another way to do it click on the payment posting previously done now as you can see that we haven't answered uh we haven't entertained the cpd at all so let's transfer this amount 1 65 1 65 does it make sense that we are mentioning the balance in the transferred and it is again transferred to the primary insurance okay so in this way in this way we have filled all the boxes and uh if i i want to show you one more thing uh huh we filled all the boxes and during the training session i told you to check the to check if you have posted everything correctly click on the allowed box and press the tab key can you press the tab key uh you need to click it until the right off the right off do you see the transaction balance zero on top yes click again click tab again i'm sorry click on the allowed first yes now tab over you will see transaction balance is zero it means that your payment posting is 100% correct okay so okay so you transferred the same amount to the same insurance and then you will receive the era next time you can post it unbalanced your c o b because when whenever you do not mention any payments for any c p d the system will consider it as unbalanced cob that you might have missed a payment there the system doesn't know itself that there is a pending payment on the insurance side so that's why you didn't answer anything so you can mention the same amount in the transfers when you receive the e r a post the e r a and you can submit the claim to the secondary but i guess medicare uh medicare automatically crosses over so uh you don't have to resubmit the claim so now i'll go back to the queen claim bucket that claims gone okay excellent thank you okay and that the second claim on there that's the one the other issue that i was trying to keep that isn't on hold put it in the old on hold and it doesn't seem to work that's when my kid responded to before um well i'm going to about to ask mike that all your billing concerns i will handle all your billing concerns reason why reason why because in that way we will not get confused all of us okay some issues are dealt by spoken to so many people at this point it's hard to know who to send what to but i will contact you if i have any questions and if you need me to go elsewhere you'll tell me the thing is i'm your billing implementation specialist i can assign the work to anyone anyone can assist me but they cannot they cannot work on your issue directly okay because if i'll be out of the loop i want to know what is happening right so uh the thing is that uh okay so your concern over here is that uh you are unable to put when you put this claim on on hold it's not going to the on hold claims bucket correct i would like to check that as well first i will click the refresh button it didn't work okay so is this the patient the second one second one okay it says holds claim there but it doesn't show in the bucket and i'm you know uh let me check there must be an explanation for this this had happened we only tried it one other time at the beginning when we were still when dan was still here and he he had said oh because there's been a problem with the payment he goes maybe with a payment issue but this claim has had no payment associated with it so it's it might be possible but uh there is a discrepancy over here which i can see uh how how can a single person have an appointment for two different providers at the same because they when the patients she's pregnant she actually had the baby today which is why i wanna hold you so she comes in she sees brittany to sign up tax she's just the resource so we don't bill under her everything gets built under karen so that's gonna eventually when we have to run reports we're gonna have to get all that stuff written off marks at the scene but for now no problem okay so you put the claim on hold okay i have put it on hold again i've just removed the responsible plan let's check so it has gone from here from the queen claim bucket right but i wouldn't know how to go back and find it now like when i need to take it off the hold it's not on anything let me check i'm just checking the few options mm let me check the patient's card number 97 40 this is just for testing purposes sure you won't have to follow this uh and i forgot the account number 974 it's really strange let me check let me put you on a short hold and i'll be i'll be using the system as well okay thank you for staying online sure uh well the thing is that i will forward it i'll forward it to our reconfiguration team because i have also like forward it to whether a request from your practice which were mentioned to dave on the reports training session uh and i will forward this one as well okay thank you it will it will be resolved okay uh by monday if not by monday then by tuesday for sure okay no problem okay so for now i'll just try to be careful and not to submit it i'm sorry i said now i'll i'll just try to be careful and not submit it in the meantime uh well yes you can just get on hold like keep them on hold until monday mhm i'm i'm pretty much sure that it will be resolved by then okay is there anything else i can help with um one quick question i don't have an example for it but if the patient has um say they owe a balance of coinsurance amount on five different lines and then they have an advance payment for $50 and they owe 200 and something will i be able to choose like to put $10 on each line if i want to yeah okay it'll be easier when i have an example okay you go ahead with what you needed to um it's the same way it's the same way uh i guess this was the patient that was yeah okay so do you see the unapplied balance 11 yes you can post it anywhere like if there are 10 if there are 11 date of services and you want to post a $1 on each data service you can do that okay not in one go in 11 goes in one go in one go what will happen you'll have to come up over here in patient payments and when you will enter all the details it will actually add the payments in chronological order okay so if a patient owes you uh on the first date of service $10 on the second date of service $10 on the third date of service $10 and you have already uh and you haven't applied balance of $20 the system will start posting the payments from the very first date of services mhm okay so over here if you post the payment it will be in the chronological order but if you post the payments manually you can post it anything anywhere okay okay thank you okay anything else i can help with um i think for right now that's my only question there'll be more as more things happen obviously but right now you've answered everything i had what we can do is uh i have a suggestion for you is it possible if i call you at four eastern each day um and we can discuss we can discuss all of your concerns on daily basis sure because what i think is it will be a lot of helpful for you and for me as well mhm if we discuss on daily basis if if something comes up we can reschedule it okay sounds good sounds good okay uh and now i have to discuss one more thing now as you know dan actually uh resigned and uh is no longer working over here and that's the point when i was transitioned uh with his work and uh i was working on your practice uh i kept my focus on training you guys and i kept my focus on uh the the the concerns you're facing the issues you're facing correct and i checked the enrollment order the enrollment on which you're uh like you mentioned in the training session that you're not getting the eras so i did the research that why you're not getting the eras and i shared an email uh with seth a couple of days ago and i want to share the same thing with you as well that uh the reason why you're not getting eras from those insurances because the era set up was not complete for some insurances the ones you're getting those era are complete their setup is complete some things are remaining if you provide me those things i'll start working on them besides insurance aetna all other era enrollments will be completed in 15 business days i have no sorry i can just share the information with you the requirements you can share the same thing with seth as well okay okay because if if if seth is somehow not available if somewhere he can he can give you the same you know information and uh i can take the information from you it's available but the thing is as soon as i have this information i'll start working on it and this is the information i need logins for this insurance this this insurance and this insurance okay cigna portal logins were not working the logins which you provided us they're not working let me make sure i didn't change cigna hold on okay yeah it's alright it has changed since then because that was active when we first filled out all the spreadsheet so i do have the updated signal one okay and then do you see over here that uh these are the plans if i go at the end of the lines we need recent eobs for these plans i gave him all that information okay thank you i told you start and there was a lot of work with jumbled up so we i want a fresh start for this you can you can simply provide me with the e o b s or eras anything anything will work and uh if i called back over here i need the odp from provider side the logins were working uh but uh we need to have uh one time um you know code so then we'll log in on humana we'll send a code the security code to the provider office i guess and they will give you the o t p and you will give us the o t p okay you you seth will better know how this works because it might it might be possible because you guys are the one who received the otp but we don't know about that so that's right and for healthcare partners and i p a we need logins for red card we don't have red card we've never used it so your previous uh clearing house was giving you the eras in the system no for healthcare partners we always got them on paper okay okay no problem if you if you can acquire the red card logins we can initiate the enrollment and you receive the e r as in the cure md application okay and if not that's okay okay on the letterhead no i said if the healthcare partners one and that's probably of all these the least important you know we don't have that many so i don't mind if those go on paper but i'll see what we can do about the red card no problem and uh for practice i need the practice letterhead okay because some insurances do require some verifications they have like many steps and uh for that i need the practice letterhead so once i have this information i guarantee you within 15 business days all the era enrollment will be completed except this one etna take etna takes 30-60 business days for the enrollment right okay that's the longest i bet united healthcare that's not on this list united healthcare in oxford and 1199 um you're not from those insurances now i'm still i'm still getting them in um 11 99 i'm not getting it all i'm just getting on paper um yeah i'm getting paper um remittances united healthcare and oxford i'm only getting them through carry out even though they're all for all cure md united healthcare and oxford yes uh and are there any other plans which are okay so now we discussed signal i can give you the password let me i'm looking at the list let me ask you let me ask you let me ask you you're submitting all the claims to all the insurances through cure m d as of right now yeah i mean there's one or two like if the patient if there was something that goes back to april but anything dated may 1st forward is only being submitted to actually i actually have a way what i'll do is i'll ask the enrollment team to compile an excel sheet it will be a detailed excel sheet now do you see there are 71 plans over here yes they will mention all the plans all the electronic plans over there on that excel sheet and they will mention is the enrollment is complete or not if the enrollment uh is not complete then they will also uh you know put in the text that were the required documents mhm so it will be a complete excel sheet yeah we had this they had sent again at the beginning there was a spreadsheet and eth and i worked on it one night populating it with stuff we were looking everything up so we i know what you just said about we sent this stuff over i understand i totally understand it uh i will try to get access of dan's system it's just back in the store so i'll try to get the access of the system but somehow it will be it will be great for us that if you can provide this data again i know that uh you have sent it and i really i really understand the situation over here but to to move smoothly uh i would like these information again okay so you put that document let me see you put it okay okay i'm gonna put this into because i never think to go into so i'm just gonna send myself an email with that i know you're gonna be sending myself an email with that information okay now i have it okay so when i get it from you you send it to me and to seth maybe i actually sent it to seth only because he's the boss that's fine i have your email i didn't have your email at the first so uh i've already sent this information to seth if you can uh expedite it somehow because um i'm no longer in the mood to resign uh like anywhere near soon so i'm glad to hear that so that will be a relief for you so you can share all the information will be with me i'll take care of everything okay okay alright thank you very very much for your help no problem i'll give a call to you on monday at four p.m. eastern okay sounds good thank you for your time thank you have a good weekend have a good day bye bye"}}, {"id": 1061, "data": {"call_id":

back around the 1230 in pacific time okay okay sure i will thank you bye okay"}}, {"id": 1062, "data": {"call_id": "1623271098.141162.txt", "text": "hey linda its from cure md how are you oh okay i think uh not really i've been i've been sick yeah i i haven't been very well okay i just wanted to let you know that i had a discussion with veronica and uh her reasoning was that uh there's a bit of short staffing so i told her that i'll actually create um a custom rejections report on my end um uh so that should help them out in a way that it will help them capture all the rejections that they can at least make sure that it doesn't go out of uh the timely filing limit or anything like that so but yeah because i did have a let let them know that every choice i want to go ahead and run that report because now that you showed me how to do it um i told her i was gonna go ahead and do it every two weeks and whatever rejections are not done are there i'm just gonna uh shoot him out to her and stephanie as a task that they need to look for it because that's what i did after that day a week so we're trying to figure out what to do because there were so many they were all really the facility so because i went in there and i searched for the account numbers all right in there and i look because you have the account number is not there so i looked for them i put them wrote them down and i sent him as task and i put down the reason why i went in and i checked okay what was the reason so i did that and so i got the report and so what i did is i gave her the report that i was working on and i said here it is the account numbers are there the reason the reason why is there also so this will be a lot faster for you all to clean it up and she said oh thank you he goes he goes uh because i told her i asked her i said almost all of them are the facilities why aren't you cleaning them out i mean i last week i said i talked to you said you had worked with it and i thought you had really cleaned it out because actually that's what you're supposed to do i said but now we run this one and there's all this stuff out here and well it's very time consuming looking for the account numbers and looking for the reason why and all this because it is time it was time for me but i did it and uh so i told her i said well i'll do it every two weeks i'll run the report and i'll do all this so that way we will save your time i'll look for the account number to do this work and that way all you do is this account numbers in there you go in there and fix them and you shoot him out i said okay so that's what that's what we're planning to do but did you put did you put the the the sickness back how they were because of the total i said it'd be a big mess you know if we because i don't think they understand where only the one that was wrong was supposed to have that i didn't i didn't make any change it was uh the same i didn't make any changes to the actual insurance plan okay so i'm not gonna run into any insurance do not use um you might because uh those were older additions i guess there was a point uh and this change name wasn't changed by myself i believe it was veronica that changed it i think when they realized it back in the day that the insurance added was there was a duplicate profile so they changed the display name uh changing the display name doesn't remove the insurance it it just makes it inactive so any future patients do not end up using that insurance so i think they changed the name to make sure that no one ends up selecting that uh profile for the insurance so you might still see it in some of the demographics of the patient it might still be there but it's true i know but um i'm trying to to figure out okay yes i did not use it should be only the the one with the wrong with the wrong pair number right um reasoning could be different but uh sort of um i can't say what the reasoning was behind putting it to do not use either the plan was duplicate or the pairr id was not correct when i know it's it's when i had talked to you and i sent you a test to put and because i talked to i said if it's wrong we should could do not use but it's just a cigna c a or cigna e m a do not use it should have the name the name of the interest is still stay there i said not just do not use a cane you know you shouldn't leave it there because you know okay which insurance it wasn't as identifies to pay the insurance i told her i said that's the proper way of it being done because i said first of all said they cannot they cannot delete insurance once it's done and claims are set interlinked interlink with that insurance i said you cannot deactivate insurance companies you have to just leave them there but you can put to use so that way you can flag them you know it's flagged it out for everybody like wait a minute this is i need to look for another cigna because you say you do not use me pretty much most close attention and i didn't have a talk with the girls also and i told him i said y'all need to be careful when you're um setting that i mean putting uh uh setting up the uh the insurance company i said i know this one you didn't know you didn't know about it i said uh but um i've run into some i said that it's you know it's totally i mean look at the address on the card you'll need to make copies to make sure that you get a copy of the patients card also i said that's how we find out where the plane is gonna go because i wanted to one of them they had they had to do that when is she blue cross they just put two cross of texas and they shut that up and so i had there was one one account and i had and i showed it to them i said look at this one just watch blue cross me i said yeah but you look at at the address on the back of the card i said it's a medicare advantage that's what it is i said so in the on the back of the card it has a different address scratch scratch pennsylvania or something like that i told her i said that is where the claims have to go out i said not regular blue cross and they said well we thought it was just blue cross blue cross and so i told i said you know what what happened what's wrong here is this girls don't know what the hell they're doing i said they haven't been trained properly they haven't they don't know and she goes yeah i know that and i said well i said you know somebody should train them sit down and train them and say hey and uh what i did is as i'm coding i'm seeing a whole bunch of mistakes from the front office so i've been printing them out and highlighting the mistakes so what i'm gonna do is talk to linda and say look we need to sit down with your girls and show them the mistakes and show them this is not acceptable you need to make sure you get the right information and i said they did it because it's right here and he has the girls you know the receptionist name has on the bottom you know cause i got it from the system and some of them i was able to print them out but uh so i told that i said let me do that for you i mean every two weeks i'll run the report rejection report and uh and i'm still gonna do it because i wanna be checking up on them because i told him i said she doesn't it for y'all to be building the claims out if they're being rejected and they're just sitting there not being worked with i said unfortunately i didn't know how to do this report before i said but for now i do i said brad show me how to do it and of course brad after you show me how to do it i forgot so i wouldn't be playing around with it and figure it out myself again again and so what i did is i made i made um a step and i printed it and i put the highlighted the steps so i have it in in a file and i put cure md i put it in there and i put it in the file how to print rejected reports steps to print rejected report so i have it there so that's why i told you i'm gonna start doing it was just like i've checked for the uh ones that the doctor signs out i sign out and later on i run the report and say okay did they build them out and i can see they're still there and that's another report that we need to clean out so i need for you to show us how show me how do i go in there clean them out from that report after cause they already been built some of them they have been built yeah but they're still hanging on that report and it's just a mess so i was telling i said we need to clean out this report this report should be cleaned out time i said not have this mess i said this is ridiculously i keep telling you guys there's still nothing is done sure um another thing that i that i um i found out that we had rejections denials was that the location and that that'll set you talk to you already because i was there on monday i went by there on monday i think that's when you called but i was visiting with them so i didn't pick up and then after that i went to my doctor's appointment okay so i had those rejections i think there was about three or four claims that the place of service was incorrect so when there it was pharmacy what is what's happening here why are y'all i said why aren't you being careful she goes it's a system i dont know how to fix them out and she said she already talked to you guys i fixed that that was uh coming from the place of service i was defaulting as a place of service well bred to me i'm sorry but this is my opinion we are all entitled to our opinions it's i didn't say anything toretto but in my mind i said okay if it's defaulted to that i said the biller should look at it make sure that paid service correct and then continue obviously obviously and if it's a pharmacy they should go in there and correct it and get it done and out it goes right so to me it's like just that is carelessness on the billers part okay i'm sorry but that's my opinion but anyway did you fix it i just wanted to know if uh do you have access to your system there's like um four to five of the tickets they're all about payment posting so i just wanted to cover those if you have time right now if not if not i know you are kind of so i can check back later yes i don't feel good at all this time yeah i've been i went to see the doctor on on monday and then yesterday and today i i just haven't been feeling well from my i have problems with my stomach and so anyway i don't and i noticed that not to alert bread so he won't do any good for us to go through something to stick in my mind i noticed that yesterday last night because i tried coding because i had to finish coding and i had to be going back and double checking myself because my mind was just like i couldn't think properly and i'm like oh my god this is not good but i got it i got it done it took me longer than usual to code the small report that i had but i said you know so i i think i talked to grace yesterday i told grace i said i feel like a basket case i said my stomach hurts my you know my arthritis is hurting i'm hurting all over uh do you do you mind what's today wednesday today is wednesday okay uh tomorrow alright i'm supposed to go to the office and help with stuff that we start started on monday so i'm not gonna be close to my bank and then on friday i have another doctor's appointment on um just give me a time if you're available i'll call if not then i have always call

curemd this is peter how may i help hi um my client is trying to buy a new ekg machine and i'm trying to see if it's compatible with cure m d um but i can't quite see that what's the name of the found one it's an e don e d a n s e 1515 and it is a p c based e c g machine uh well uh unfortunately that's not gonna be a compatible device because curemd only support to um manufacturers ekg one is the well challenge uh e c g machine and the other one is mid mark ecg machine that is the i q mark mid mark okay thank you okay so if you if you wanna get a detail of all the compatible devices that are compatible with curemd that we recommend um if you are logged into curemd you will see a support button on the top right corner right beside your name just click on that support button okay and then go under the knowledge base option then that it will open a new screen on this main screen look for uh the option that is check information it's from one of the top main options go for tech information and in there uh the first option is compatible devices if you click on it okay you will get the details of all the compatible devices with curemd so i see the mid mark one and then i also see so it says pc based e c g it does not say welch allyn where can i oh underneath challenge um i don't see any let's see and the first column you have the manufacture first name and the second column you have the device name got you and then here it just says cardio perfect exactly that's that's the name of the device the cardio perfect is the only one that's compatible as far as well but these devices are still uh these devices are still only compatible uh with cure m d on the internet explorer browser they they currently do not work on chrome or any other browser except for oh thye dont work on chrome not yet our development team is already in the process of uh working with these companies to make those compatible on chrome as well but for now they're only working with curemd on the internet explorer and also um we do charge for configuring these devices with curemd for one time and then charge what's the charge on that for one single device the first time you'll have to pay $750 for an e k g and um if you already have a set of one with cure m d and you would like to do another one on any other computer then we will only charge $100 so the first the first time you'll have to pay $750 because uh there are some configurations involved that uh cost around $650 and 100 dollars are for configuring one single device with so if you opt to configure two devices the first time you'll have to pay 8 50 which includes alright that's 6:50 for one time only and we charge $100 per device every time i got you and in case if something goes wrong um if you face any trouble uh we uh fix our problems free of cost for for that without any trouble okay um so really just the there's just the two that are compatible looks like the mid mar and then the well share one can you tell me the practice name uh for which you're actually calling it yeah mhm it's portland urgent care okay and your good name my name is guimar g u i m a r okay alright so any other questions um no i will just look up i need to look up these ones on here then and see if those are the ones that we want but okay yeah i just wanted to make sure because when i went into this um when i went into the compatible devices and i clicked on the cardio perfect one it wouldn't let me through it just uh it just keeps saying the site is not secure um yeah sometimes the evenings are not um probably updated by the manufacturer so if you just copy you will get by the way just take the name from there and just search for it yeah for sure alright i will go ahead and do that and then i will get back to you guys no

regarding a claim rejection um and it's by a doctor again so is she available yeah this is the food that that's the one doctor in uh yes doctor doctor did you actually log this ticket for aetna better health rejection yeah and i'm the one who log in the ticket yeah yes so um i did actually check the system and i'm unable to actually look in the rejection rejected back it if you have actually received an injection from aetna and about the health of louisiana right they they gave me a letter that they cannot process the claim because they're missing the npi inbox 33 a 33 a okay now 32 yeah okay now the thing is doctor 33 a section is for the i'm sorry um that's for the location npi and the other information but right now since the location if you have only one location if you don't have any specific location npi so you cannot actually use your own npi in the box 33 a so do they want your npi to appear in 33 a box yeah that's why and then uh with the uh with the aetna i using my uh social security number the one the hit for form that i clicked and you said they're using the uh the e i n the employer the business tax id i am in the process to change it but they haven't changed it yet that maybe the problem i called them this morning i didn't have my old i d which is 079661968 and they said we need to put the npi in box 33 a 33 a you want your phone number i can give you the phone number i would need the uh patient account number unless you have actually received this rejection so i would see like what information is being transmitted through the hip because um right now i can see the npi should appear in your 33 a box um hm give me one moment yeah uh 33 it must be the npi the individual npi 1215926480 if it's not there i can actually look into that but uh can you actually give me the patient account number of the patient name on which you get the rejection yeah the patient i have five of them in the in the time but i gave you one of them shelly shelly walker yeah shirley walker can you spell that for me please walker w a l k e r okay and last name yeah and shelly how you spell it s h a f f h e l l y l l y let me claim number just give me one moment doctor the charges the the the data service april 27 21 and the amount of 120 april 27 got it did you send the claim on paper no i sent to you by the uh the your that's the first time i sent via the cure md doctor there must be uh doctor there must be some confusion at this point because if i look at the um i'm sorry the specific charge for 27 2021 it wasn't actually submitted through our system i can only see umm it's april for uh sorry april 27 and it's still under the charge status um hm thats weird and even gave me they give me a recheck letter that provider npi location on the claim form is in back 33 a maybe i missed doctor in that case what we will do is uh because i can see you haven't submitted a single claim for data service for 27 2021 so um maybe there must be some confusion on their end as well what you can do is simply go to the charge section go through the data service for 27 2021 for shelly walker account number 6326 correct and aetna better health is actually being selected on the profile am i right is it the right account number as well 6326 the patient account number i have it here is 08933 mm there must be a different patient then uh can you confirm the account number one more time 08933 got ya okay i can't find any patient of this account number even can you search the patient on your end on the in the application please with shelly walker yeah i put it on for you maybe the other account this is the the account give me one min so what is the account number you can see in cure m d application yeah hold on let me try sure i send it in give me a moment i have the five patient re check that i say i'm the same guy the same thing they need the npi that i understand that but uh i'm actually actually trying to find the actual patient account the account number is 6326 yes 63 26 and um if you go to the charges section you would see that um the status of 4 27 2021 is under charged and which actually clearly states that wasn't submitted or it wasn't generated through cure md application now i agree to you maybe um must be some confusion or someone actually submitted the claim on paper and this is why you're getting the paper will be in front of you or the letter which actually clearly stays there uh they they will actually reject the claim for the specific data service due to the incorrect information in 33 a which makes sense to me but the thing is it should be submitted through cure md electronically because you have the uh i'm sorry the pair id added in the system and however if i actually go to the heck for as well it does give me the um i'm sorry the okay i have two npi here the hit for that i have on the cure m d electronic ed i use the uh the e in the business card but the aetna they have my social security that's why i'm asking you to create for me the hit for the social security tax for aetna that's completely fine that's understandable but uh right now if you if you actually um looking to a rejected bucket there were no claims rejected for aetna better health so this is why i'm actually uh requesting you to submit the claim because it wasn't submitted as i can't see any submission for this patient for that date of service so you can go to the charge yeah yeah when you when you create for me the the the the order form for aetna don't believe the one with medicare just add on another form for for for aetna better health and later on maybe american character they have the same system and they will i will use the new platform to submit edi for you i will create a new one you're mixing two things at this point doctor will be used only for paper submission when you talk about electronic submissions that is different i go let's say i go to hell now okay 4 21 okay okay i and then uh four 21 or four 27 oh 4 27 i am sorry now i go to her name and i put the charge and then they went let me see now i bought the edit charge now and they come up with the claim right and then go to professional players and the doctor the drop down that box they have 33 h platform one is 882 bro and then the other one is the uh it's a hit for two double u r l that's what i have for different forms the other the other three i don't use no more i'm really sorry doctor i'm i'm really sorry i'm confused at this point doctor um i can see for this specific patient you haven't submitted it even a single claim from cure m d application do you submit them on paper or from any other system no i used the edi claim perfect go to yeah i claim and then i dropped down to the section they said hit for two double u r l that's a hit for two w i l 02 12 that's the date they create that's they use their own tax the new tax i d can we can we do a screen session can you show me the screen shot uh not the screenshot it's any desk and i want you to actually share your screen so i can actually look into on your screen and what information is being transmitted so um you can actually go to any browser like chrome just go to the chrome browser and go for any desk dot com so you can download it for free uh i think i am busy to go to my to see the patient now i i you if you can talk to me tomorrow is much better i will go to the share the screen with you see when i go to the e d i play there is four section when i drop down in the in the in the address box they have four for his platform that i'm talking about the e d i claim they have different the section drop down there four of them the other three is the old one i don't use it and in february i agree with doctor but i'm actually confused at this point like i cant see even a single submission through the system and it is just actually giving me the payment posted against this specific um i'm sorry the date of service but it doesn't give me any records but in case if you're actually submitting the claims through cure m d so you can simply go to the charge page open up the appointment for 27 2021 you said the right way to actually hover your mouse on the claim section this will take you to the professional and you can go to the professional and click on edi claim to generate the file and in this way if you generate the file so i can actually confirm uh to you at this point that you're you will be submitting the claim under 12159264 which is the individual npi with the tax id 810794672 so this information was being used before as well and you haven't got the rejections so i will request you to submit the claim in this way and in case of a rejection if it pops up in your rejected bucket you can log on your ticket would that be okay yeah yeah let let me talk to you tomorrow before i will start declining so when i can call you tomorrow yeah you can call me tomorrow then we will go over when doctor okay uh from 9 to 5 sure around around around

now uh they let me tell you what uh the work flow any normal practice is and let me know how is your work flow different from what i'm gonna say or if it is the same so when a patient comes into the practice for the first time the patient may be uh an established patient who's been coming to you already or the patient can be a new patient for a new patient when the patient is you know walks in uh make the patient has been referred by any of the doctor or the then or heard about you in a magazine or newspaper somewhere and they're walking in so the the the front desk the receptionist will take down their details and put it into the system and create a new patient profile for them and they will take down there uh id and upload it upload the pictures and uh you know just after that they will maybe have to create an appointment with the doctor the first initial visit of the patient and in case if a patient is already established and already has an appointment scheduled so once again they will be going to the uh the receptionist and uh the receptionist will be uh taking a look at their appointment and they will be taking the patient in after that when the patient is in if it's a new patient or taking patients there checked in take them they're waiting for for probably their vitals to be done and then comes the the medical assistance were taking those information and they're uh you know once again after that the patients will be waiting for the next uh you know going to the next room and the vitals normally uh taken by the medical assistance yameen uh melissa uh alright uh johnny and and i think omar right okay and then the the patient goes through the providers room for the initial visit and uh you know they they're seen by the doctor once once they're seen by the doctors they're done so they go back to the receptionist they check if they have any follow up appointment or whatever needs to be done in a treatment plan needs to be ordered or what what not and then they will just leave uh on the other hand the patient is coming for doctors visit an established patient maybe the patient is also coming for chemotherapy so for that the chemotherapy uh will be conducted by the nurses of course and after checking the patients and the the nurses will you know create a point um their administration within a human manager and so documenting it into the system and giving the administration to the patient now uh in the time in the middle uh when the patient is being seen by the doctor the initial or follow up visit so the doctor is prescribing or is is you know uh dictating actually the note to the medical assistance and the medical assistance uh in uh can be chopra and so they're they're gonna be doing it for for the doctor and uh then uh in the meantime uh you know the nurses will be documenting uh the the you know the provided notes maybe and also the stripes will be doing to provide a note and nurses will be uh sorry the the medical assistance will be documenting the vitals and you cheryl and uh you guys will be doing the electronic prescriptions and uh and you will also be involved in the administrative uh uh thing over here at the practice and at the practice as administrator i'm i'm just you know drinking each users workflow and roll at the practice so that i can understand and make you understand better whats the role so is that the workflow of your practice yes it is perfect that's amazing that's how every normal practice works and uh that's that's how you do it so the receptionist tell me two receptionists uh we have in our system uh how are they uh with their work ashley and dalilah are they good they know what they need to be doing uh how should they be treated the patient and uh where where they need to create an appointment they they're good with that right yes perfect amazing still let them know if they have any questions we're gonna address them tomorrow in the meantime they can jot down their questions uh they they can see their workflow if they have any problems in scanning the documents and putting it up into the folder or creating an appointment or something they can just any questions i'll be ready to answer then you know chopra nabeel and nayab uh how good are they in creating a provider note and uh adding excellent they're they're all good yeah perfect that's amazing still if they have any questions how to document where and what they can just let us know uh then uh the uh the medical assistance or you're gonna be taking the vitals yasmin melissa johnny so how bout them uh they they're familiar with their work flow and what needs to be documented where and how did they documente not at all oh okay so that's where we need to work at so the medical assistance need to be trained on how about since they will also be looking at the front desk part how how do things are familiar with their front desk job the medical assistance no everybody knows how to enter the patient's enter their demographics enter their insurance um everybody needs everybody knows how to schedule an appointment the only part is um the medical assistance have not been entering the vitals uh the vitals because is it true that to answer the vital you must open a provider note i'm sorry it is my understanding that enter the vitals you have to open a provider is it correct uh not necessarily again that that would depend on how your workflow is so let me tell you let's say uh if the provider note is being created by the scribes so you know when when uh when the patient is seeing the doctor that's where the patient is is being looked by the strides but but tried as well so that's when the uh provided created if the provider notice created at the point of receptionist because the time and in some practices i've seen uh the receptionist know what provider note needs to be created or what provider and what patient and all so they created but apparently as your practice that's not gonna be the receptionist that's gonna be the provider of this so for that matter the provider note not have created yeah i don't want my i don't want my medical i don't want my secretary or my medical assistance to open provider note so how can medical how can my medical assistance enter in the vitals without opening a provider note alright let me tell you so what they're gonna do uh you can see the screen right they're gonna go simply where you know train them together how they're gonna i'm just showing it to you so what they're gonna do they're not gonna go to the provider note they're gonna go to the patient's profile here they're gonna pull up under clinical they're gonna come to vital we're gonna go here it is so when they're gonna go to vitals they're simply gonna click add and there that's where they're gonna say i'm just gonna put up some oops okay uh yeah oh okay just a tab tab it over right you can do that too or uh um i'm just randomly putting some things just to show you alright let me just a little higher okay good fun so what they're gonna do just document and they're gonna save now uh when they're documents documented the vitals over here and now he has moved to to see the providrt the scribe is created to provide a note that's where their duty comes in what they need to do is they're gonna go to provide note let's say they're gonna create a provide a note uh let's create to provide a note and they're gonna pull up the name of the doctor and pull up just to you know anything i'm i'm just selecting random things there and i'm gonna get alright uh okay great okay now let's consider that this is the template which has been pulled up for this particular one and now the documented vitals which have been documented by the medical assistance needs to be fetched into this particular note template so what they need to do is either they would already have a flag of vitals over here if there is no flag over there and they can simply be brought into the system how by going to the vitals here you know you can take a look at the vitals click on vitals and you know the the ones which are over here you can't documented over here however you you already know that there are vitals which have been documented by the medical assistance so for that you go to unassociated once you click on there and that's where they are there that the vitals which have been edited over here the vitals are already added in this note if you scroll down a little bit there already there they they were there uh oh yeah so so you know the latest vitals if the flag is onto the provider note they are already you know the system automatically bring them in so that is why it's not appearing over here but let's say if the flag of vitals was was not over here the system would not have brought it into the provider notes so for that they will be staying under unassociated anything which is documented into any of these flag which is not associated to any provider note comes under unassociated labs and their documentation of vitals so they're staying over here because they were never documented onto a provider note so if they need to be brought into the provider note that's where you will simply click on there and it will show you what exactly was the documentation you hit accept and where you want to add it you just you just put it there i'm gonna have no because i'm not doing it right now right now the system automatically pulled up the vitals because a there were the latest vitals for that day available and be that the flag was already there onto the provider note template if either two was not there the system would not have documented the vitals into the system alright so that that's where the beauty of scribe is to take a look if the vitals which have been added by the nurse uh um the medical assistant are over there onto the provider note okay that's how they're gonna do and uh once they're done they will be the scribe will be doing everything on the provider note accept electronic prescriptions is that correct yep except electronic prescriptions of anything of of right so for that matter that's where you're uh you you you come into uh the the note uh provide note and that's where you prescribe the uh medication now how do you think you how about carolina and elmet yep they they good about that yep okay perfect so then that's do you guys provide a chin for within the or do you go to the patient and medications and prescribe from there you know it goes within the the scribes are um keeping it like they're reconciling into the note okay perfect that's great so when they're getting into the note that's what i want because every detail whatever has been documented should become the part of the provider notes so that you know the documentation is all good so that that should be the focus always alrighty now then i'm the uh uh you know the the providers the providers most of the time will be dictating the notes but anyway if you think they need to be given any sort of training uh to how to creat a provider note and all that uh we can definitely set that up for you but how do you think uh they would they ever uh be creating any provided notes for themselves and that's what i'm aware of okay alright but anyway we're we're hoping for that whenever they need any training so they're good so this is pretty much it so apparently uh what i figured out for now is that everybody knows about their duty and their job and they're doing it all fine except the medical assistance don't know how to add vitals so we're gonna conduct the training on that that's that's amazing and how it came with chemo therapy manager who is uh doing chemo therapy manager and uh plans and all that would be me okay everything only you um eventually i wanted to be sherly but i want to get it under control first of course okay so did you speak to say one more time did you speak to chris about it that how can you yeah i've worked with yeah i've worked with chris over a couple of times so when i when i have time and i could get back to it then we'll go ahead and uh work on a couple more regiments okay perfect that's amazing you were gonna say something yeah let me tell you what my biggest uh my biggest things that i don't know how to do is i don't know how to order a test through curemd i don't know how to block the schedule and also when we're blocking the schedule um the patient's appointment disappear uh yes now let me tell you okay lets go to and then i need to learn how to send the physician notes to the primary care physicians and also does cure md eventually um automatically send the uh physician notes to the primary care physician and where do i enter the primary care physician and the patient demographics amazing i'm gonna just a minute let me list down all the questions so that i can answer one after another uh huh that's not true i feel like i'm talking okay perfect so let's let's start off with the uh with the concerned about scheduler uh how this block schedule i'm gonna take you to settings tab here under practice you have provider and practice provider this is one of the work flows uh you can block or add new calendars so what you would do here we'll go to that particular better for who you are either looking to create a new uh calendar or block the particular calendar so what you're gonna do you pull up the provider looking on the name of the provider you go inside the profile of the provider right on the top you have some options schedule and block schedule if you're looking to create the schedule you would go to the schedule and that's where you create this account to demonstrate you i'm not gonna create any this demonstrate you you click on add as like there you'll get a window open where you put in the name of the calendar over here you select the location that at what location would this calendar be used that so you're gonna pull up the location from here you have to get the location for what date range are you keep getting this calendar for the calendar cannot be created in one go for more than 365 days so you would have to create from within 365 days so uh let's say generate the first until december the 31st you could do that then you put it up you put up a time frame here since since what time in the morning till what time in the evening if you wanna do it different dates for different timing that that's where you can go to weekly view you see this is a standard view and this where the weekly view is where we select days saving providers wednesday and friday only so you can friday here so you will select the days verse and then you will select you're gonna create the calendar for monday from which day to day uh once again up to 3 65 days and for wednesday and friday then you select the time so let's say the provider comes on mondays at eight a.m. but on wednesdays the provider comes at 12 and on fridays the provider comes at in the noon maybe so you wanna you know you wanna change the time from here so you can click up the individual time from here and the the calendar will be created accordingly and then over here you will select the end time when is the ending time of this that day and then this is the duration now a duration is the uh the duration of one time slot how long should one time slot be you can move it to five minutes no no that was the maintenance man walking by okay so uh you can you know so like 5 minute time slot 10 minute time slot 15 i always think is good because in uh that actually is a very nice calendar where let's say you're creating it an appointment for 30 appointment slots will get consumed show you that there are two slots which are consumed and similarly if it's for 5 minutes so one appointment consumed but still you have some space to cover up with other patients for 10 minutes so i always i always recommend to use 15 this is the booking which means that how many bookings per time slot would you like to allow there are some practices and i've seen some doctors seeing the patient uh you know within five minutes so they might have up to three or four bookings per time slot so so you can you know you have an option up to 10 i mean you know 10 patients in 15 minutes thats amazing but but you know it's difficult for for for practice practice at least so you know uh you can keep it one or two or three however you like thank you can you you want to just more patients within one time slot so you can change this one over here even if you do not change it here you anyway have an option to add more patients to the same time slot that is a little that that says it forcefully done but you anyway the system lets you do that so that's where you can do it once you're done you you save on the top and that's how you create the provided calendar now i'm gonna show you how you block the calendar so that's where all the calendars are appearing all right that's where you can see the logs of them who created it when and what sort of calendar was that calendar created by uh the name is coming here probably logs from the back end maybe and then there it says that you know it was a weekly calendar for every week from january 1st 2019 until so and so forth okay now that's where you block the calendar the way you add a calendar exactly the same way you pick up a block for the calendar it's only that you the count the block let's say you're adding a lunch block for every day so you see uh you know the calendar is going on from january 1st 2021 until december the first of december 31st 2021 so you're gonna add a block here and you're gonna name it and you're gonna select once again the location at what you are looking to uh block this calendar then you're gonna select the date over here and then you're gonna select the time so let's say you're blocking it from 12 to 1 maybe so you're you know put up the time here and 12 p.m. to one p.m. and uh you're gonna just simply uh save alright the account do you want this one daily and every day so you're gonna save on the top and the system will create a block on the calendar i'm just going to add it and i'm gonna we're gonna delete it but this is just to show you is there a calendar on for this provider uh no okay let's see where the calendar is uh we do have one here okay let's try to this is all i'm gonna have to change all this oh you're gonna change it okay i'm gonna have to because that's not right okay i guess i should not block for now because there could be sure uh also the second work to add a block is right from here so you just go to the schedule and that's where you have an option to block you're click click on the so you wanna block your calendar or you want to block the patient or you wanna no just block the calender like let's go to the doctor hussein uh okay for instance today i wanted to put a block on him from 3:00 on but if i put that block all these patients you see um horatio maria lorenzo all these patients their appointments would disappear yes because you're putting up the block during the time frame they have an appointment already so so we have to change the appointment before we put the block in correct yes that's right you can uh simply reschedule it let's say you can demonstrated to you by pulling creating well that's the long time i'm gonna do it like 1 45 can you do it for like 1 45 1 45 yeah okay we have this appointment here so you can move dthis appointment uh to other slots as well so so let's say i'm gonna bring it down over here okay calendars you've been changing he's trying to this not working okay 5 15 alright so okay you see now i could move the uh just just hold the name of the patient and move to the other slobt and it's gonna leave this space there it's just because you know it was not uh it's a big appointment that i've created uh but you know you could just simply move around this appointment directly from here we can just pick and drop it onto whichever slots you want to make i never even we could do that now you do so that's amazing and i'm just gonna change the status of this appointment and cancel it real quick okay so the appointment is gone now uh you can see that appointments which were canceled you also have an option that if if an appointment is cancelled it just goes away from the calendar so how do you want to set it up no i want i want it like that okay i see okay so that's how you you know you can move it i can um it's it's it's just you know messes up the calendar a little but i guess that is okay and that's in uh june 3rd calendar so you know i mean for now it's gonna stay here if you want to have you wanna see the appointments like that so that's how you uh you know uh calendar that's how you loved calendar and that's how you move the appointments around also you might have to move let's say there are uh some patients who doctor hussein is not seeing but doctor uh you know another provider is so what you would do is here would pull up two calendars right one after another uh into multiple view calendar so let's say you're gonna select the calendar over here in north and that is gonna be for a doctor hussein here and that is gonna be for today there's no calendar today here okay was there account okay well let's go to number two because doctor hussein and are over at the number two location today for real okay number uh huh okay okay there are no okay here it is so this is a block calendar and these are the appointments here so at times as it was you might have to you know move some appointments from one calendar to another what you would do you would have one calendar open in this slot the ticket one open and then i'm now i'm gonna calendar here into this one and if we change this to alma okay uh huh and then can i pull one of these patients from here and put it on alma or no that's right exactly that's what i'm trying to tell you so now what you could do you could simply once again hold the name of the patient and drag it and drop it to the slot you're looking to do let's create a test patients here and let's try to do that okay now uh um how did you get to this view this is just on the mall this is just on the schedule or everybody has access to this uh to move the appointment ahm like my secretaries and my mas and my scribe they all have access to yes yes okay alright so i'm gonna create this appointment here uh we have this appointment now you hold the name of the patient and move it to start over here you want to can i try it can i try it yes yes please no you you you hold on to oh it did oh perfect okay cool alright so that's how you can simply move the appointment you won't have to change or something do something you know because you simply go ahead and move the appointments like that now you see right there uh doctor hussein has this block from 1:00 to 1:45 today i wanted to open this up so how do i remove this block right here from 1:00 until 1:45 alright let me show you what you're gonna do you're gonna click on the slot its gonna show you unblock oh my gosh okay that's all right so however uh unfortunately you might not be able to unblock multiple time slots at the same time like you would have to click on each time slot to unblock it or otherwise so that's how you can do it and uh that's that's about the calendar similar things can be done on the weekly view multiple view daily view uh you can pull up the information of different calendars and different appointments from status so what you do you click on status and you find out if you wanna see what what patient had appointment on where what day and all on what providers calendar so you pull up the filters here you put in the name of the patient account number if you remember uh what's the resource of provider calendar patient at and you can just select the time frame from here and you hit search when you hit search do you have to have a time frame not necessarily let's just let let me just try one okay mhm provider is gonna be hussein we're gonna go from oh not that far what in the world am i doing okay april 1st to today so then search tell me all of his appointments that's right it sounds exactly the day at a time and what what is the status appointment is staying at where was the appointment at what was the reason for this appointment uh whatever was the copay and also it shows you the counter over here with an appointment whichever status it is staying and that's where we can take a look at if an appointment is charged that's that's one point so charge this appointment which are which are moved to charge which means that you provider note was created super bill was created charge was created and the charge was submitted so that's that's what is being done by your billing team i'm sure uh they are creating the charge so all these so how do i go back to where i was where there was like the list of all of his appointments oh here hold on oh okay okay so is that telling me that this april 13 visit and this april 6th visit oh so the april 13th visit wasn't billed uh april 13th thing no it is paid already so okay so why does this one say checked in and this one paid uh there could be a possibility i'm not sure uh it has to be checked with the billing team there is a possibility at times what happens is that if the patient has two appointments at the same day if there are two different uh provider notes created so what what happens is that they uh you know they merge the super bill and they just send one charge instead of having sent twice they do it once so there there can be a possibility that this one is saying under checked in and this one is saying in paid because uh you know the one was billed and the information on the other appointment was also put up on the same charge okay now uh for the for all the paid ones how can i see what was paid uh that question will be answered by by the billing team so i'm gonna note down that and uh how to see the payments so i'm gonna you know uh have somebody from the billing team involved and they'll be able to address the concern however uh they might have to understand how are your billers submitting the charges are they doing within cure m d are they doing separately how are the documenting it so they would have to do uh you know some checking on the back end and then they'll be able to address okay so let's move to your other question where you ask that how can the primary care providers be notified about the patients uh notes so that's where you you go to do this you go to the patients chart that that happens normally when a patient is being added to the system again now that's the duty of the receptionist that she takes all the details over here what they do is you come to the patient's profile here and over here where did it go wait a minute oh here it is okay so that's where you add the referring provider and that's where you add primary care provider once again the list i just showed you from referring providers uh this that list is common for uh referring providers for primary care providers for being referred to providers every all the providers are under the same list so you are you know you have they're referring providers added over here the primary care providers had to do it here okay let me see something primary uh i'm going to search let's do s a y e e d last week okay why that's weird let's do why is nothing showing up uh your these people need to be in my system that's my uh okay let's go to my list where's my list again uh here under settings i mean what what you were pulling up right now is the same list but uh you can even add it add the new providers from here but that's where you go uh practice uh here under provider you have reference providers second tab okay so select uh name last name s a y e e i'm wondering if he's not on the list okay so how do we go to how about npi dp you have his npi i would never have his npi um i would only have his name let's go to let's see if we're this is right yes okay so could you his last name yeah uh so maybe i'm not sure once again this this must have been done at the time of implementation where is this list of all the providers coming from was it provided by you guys or should have been it should have give me one second okay um sure i'm just looking at me that is really weird i see that there are some doctors that are missing oh here's here's to right here so saeed so the name is gonna have to be corrected so name uh s s a y y e e d i f a t e r uh no is this the last name yeah last name is sayeed uh no no no no uh this is the field for first name wait a minute that's how you put it here this is the first name right uh huh yes that's how you do it so the the title doctor first name is and say and uh you save on the top now you have corrected one i'm sorry uh you would have to take a look at all of all this list and it may be uh the providers are but with a different name maybe okay let's try again uh demographic primary care physician you have to click on the word primary care mhm perfect search on the top there you go you take the box yes and just take it out of the no no no just check the box and exit out of the way uh let me tell you tell me what i'm doing wrong so you will go to uh i'm sorry are you using the computer okay hold on go ahead so you're gonna click on the hyperlink you're gonna pull up the name here you're gonna search and you're gonna check the boxes like you're gonna take the box and definitely you check the box the name appears over here i'm gonna see it will just go away alright so you just check the box here is gonna appear and you just exit out of this box so i don't have i don't have to add then right no no you don't have to add it by adding it means that the provider who you're trying to add is not there so you're looking to add the providers profile now oh okay i got you i got you alright okay similarly you add a reference provider you click on the name search with the name let's say if there is any okay there is one maybe no there's nothing so you know you just pull up something in here so you know i mean you can put up with the name and all this is the whole list so i can see over here the list is not correct because there are some spaces or period of or something that you know that they haven't added not correctly so you may have to take a look and correct the profiles of the providers as who you use most of the times okay sounds good and then how do the notes go automatically to the um to the primary care physician yes so what you do is i'm gonna go to your homepage this this is what what i'm gonna show you this is a users setting so let's say if the provider is looking to enable the service on their computer they would have to go to their profile and do this if if describe is doing it on behalf of the doctor to describe has to set this setting up uh to uh to send over the provider notes referring or uh primary care provider you go to home page and under my preferences you have patients again homepage my preferences patients and that's where you enable it uh where did it go this one over here wait a minute the primary is not listed there because most of the patients come from come to us from their primary care physician mhm uh this uh it was it is right here just give me a minute i oh here it is automatically send provider notes upon signing so either primary care provider referring provider or both so right now the primary primary only go ahead and click both because i don't yeah okay and you're gonna hit save here so you're gonna be whenever whenever the note is signed i'm gonna demonstrate it to you so this has to be set up on every patient no every user so any user as a system uh you know uh chopra or you or providers or pain or uh dalilah or whoever each user would have to go to their home page here under patients they would have to go over here check this box first and then choose to be both and hit save on the top okay alright and uh they go to the patient you go to patients charts i'm gonna demonstrate it to you how does that work so i'm gonna go to this one here i'm gonna sign it and that's where it is gonna tell me you are about to sign the provider note but this note will not be faxed as no providers associated alright so because you have the option selected there because there are no providers at it that's why it's not gonna go i'm gonna handle this one here i'm gonna straight here how will it go away you know mhm primary care provider i'm just gonna select some random here and i'm gonna select a random referring provider here i'm gonna have to save now if you're gonna go and sign the provider note it will tell you that it will go to the oops i'm gonna sign and that's did i not save it there i guess not yes i did i guess uh well i would have to check probably there maybe the the the fax number is not documented in the profile of the patient's of providers that is why it's not i'm sure about that so profiles uh yes see the fax number is not there which is why it's not sending it over certified like provider here so i need i need to edit i need to edit all those things i mean i won't tell you to edit them all but maybe the the you know the main providers who you most of the time to reach out to and use for sending over the primary care or referring providers that's where you can do that and similarly history this one this provider also does not have the phone number here so i'm gonna take this class and i'm gonna take it out yeah let's save you're about to provide a note that you wanna sign no to be faxed to the primary care physician and uh the you know the reference provider it shows the names of their providers and this is the display if you hit yes or no if if you hit yes the fax will be if you hit now the provider note will get signed the fax will not be sent so let's say i'm gonna hit no you see the provider note then it tells you you know if you require to for the meaningful use if you did that at all so i'm gonna describe patient decline and the provider note will get signed but the information will not get faxed since i hit no okay alright so so this is about your question state and uh we can go ahead and you know test it whatever the workflow you have you have any questions i would be more than glad to answer them i would really uh like to answer them but whenever you come up with a question i would like you to keep the paper and pen next to you and just write it down right away so that we can you know address your concerns and i'm sure there are a lot

this is peter how may i help hi i'm calling from fox valley immediate care in regards to um question about um the charge uh fox valley you said yeah fox valley immediate care okay and may i have your name as well sure it's zara zara okay zara what exactly your question or concern is um so the doctor was saying that she was having trouble um closing the chart uh for one of the patients and she was asking what prescription was uh preventing her from closing it okay is it just for um well yes definitely that would be um easier for us to identify that particular note for a patient what's the patient's account number do you have the account number you can see that on on the top banner yeah yeah i do what's the account number 197 197 yeah 19792 okay that's the account number and from which date that uh provider note is from from today's date its from today okay alright okay sarah just bear with me on the line let me check the right person to help you with this particular matter okay one moment sure thank you alright thank you so much for patiently holding the line zara um the reason why the provider is not able to sign that particular note is because um there is a particular prescription that is not signed at the moment by the provider so if you go under that chart um you will find the prescription over there for that particular chart just go in there and sign that particular prescription once it's done you will be able to sign the provider note as well can you please check and confirm yeah one second and uh just to confirm do you want me to go in the chart or under like um the clinical and medications uh well i would prefer if you just go through the chart because that way you will actually get to the right prescription that is associated with the provider note that is creating uh the trouble so you will right away get to the that prescription which you can sign yeah okay i do see it here so um i'll go ahead and inform the doctor to go uh to go ahead and find this and then once she does that she'll be able to close the chart you said um yes definitely i can stay on the line with you can you get and have the provider try that and see if it works sure one second hello sorry about that no problem so um so doctor said that she's with a patient right now on a call and um she said as soon as she's done with that um she'll find it off and if there is anything if it doesn't close i can give you a call back sure that's fine no problem alright thank you then alright you're welcome thanks for calling in take care bye"}}, {"id": 1074, "data":

this is ben fisher calling from curemd how are you doing libby i'm good how are you i'm good thank you so much i received this ticket if you're saying you wanted to know if there's a way you can see follow ups orders out of a note that we're not assigned to anybody so i wanted to get further details about that what exactly are you looking for so like when the doctor enters a follow up and it's not assigned to a group or a specific person um we just wanna make sure that nothing's lost so we wanted to see where the unassigned orders are because we had a provider that wasn't assigning them to anybody from my understanding oh okay well for uh so so these orders uh they are lab orders no they're follow up directive like follow up in six months or alright okay well for that matter uh what you can do is you can take a look at the list of the patients since when this doctor is working um well they see patients like twice a week twice a week and they have never been doing it um no it's a nurse practitioner she has never been doing it no oh so the only solution for this would be that what you can do with you can pull up the list of her patients who were on her schedule since whenever you want to take a look at that and then you can take a look at the provider notes uh she has created yes so but but that's my thing there's too many to go through one by one there's no report that we can generate on follow up because it's creating an order or a recall can we not pull the recall that aren't assigned to somebody well you can create the recalls you there is a report that you can pull up for the recalls but you know that that is for all the recalls you know uh you will be able to thats what the follow up directive is gonna be under because she's creating it under follow up so it would generate a recall task right so let me say that one more time you're looking for uh you you want to see uh for all the patients who she has seen maybe during uh two bunch of three months time uh and the notes he has created has he created follow ups for on particular notes and if she has not created any follow ups on some particular notes and not assigned it to anybody so they you need to get a report of that right correct the ones that didn't the the ones that weren't assigned to anybody right she has been creating notes anyway but she didn't assign it to anybody correct right so if she has been creating uh the follow ups and not assigning to anybody so they will be falling under follow ups anyway let's do a remote session let me show you what i'm talking about okay we're gonna connect through any desk application downloading the second sure no problem um it is 175 211194 thank you i am sending in the request alright i can see your screen can you bring up your cure md that's perfect alright i was doing time no problem that's right okay so you go to here to see a recall mhm alright that's where you go i'm gonna take a traffic computer and uh so this is the list of all the recalls now if it is follow ups or appointment notes or whatever so let's say if it is follow up so you can search for these follow up and even if they're not assigned to anybody they will be falling under here so if nobody is working on any of these it means that these are the ones which are uh not assigned to anybody so probably uh so everybody takes care of their follow ups right what whoever has been assigned a particular follow up they only take care of that right correct so for that one uh you could only see uh that who you know who's working on which follow up and uh you know you can take a look from here there are a lot of them but how do i see if they're assigned to somebody or if they're not without going through them individually that's that's actually wait a minute let's see if we can okay well so so let me libby tell me since when do you think is this doctor uh not following this workflow two months 3 months four months since september september yeah she joined in september that's when we started using curemd oh okay all right so let me see if there's a possible way i can try to figure out uh who uh if if if there is a follow up which is not assigned to anybody so that we can get a list of it now she she knows how to do it and she's doing it right yes alright perfect let me see if there's a possible way we can uh find it out uh let me let me do a little research on this one okay alright thank you anything else for now that's it no problem thank you have a good day thank you"}}, {"id": 1094, "data": {"call_id": "1622656651.1251695.txt", "text": "we

this is ben fisher calling from cure m d how are you doing today i'm good how are you i'm good thank you so much i received this ticket uh quite a long time ago but i was still in the last week that i should keep the ticket open because you were out of the office so the ticket says that our practice would like to have the demo for a kiosk scan we haven't looked at it for a couple of years and i need to get a log in for trial for the system now you you already have it you you want a new one no so somebody had contacted us and sent us the log in uhm what ended up happening is i had one of our physicians and our billing manager look at it to see if the workflow um with something that was gonna be helpful or not in our practice that physician doctor so he ended up speaking with somebody with cure last week about what would need to be updated in the kiosk app so in order to make it more functional for his patients um and so at this point we do have a temporary log in for us that we've practiced and looked at it um but i think at this point doctor matato is now waiting to hear back from i honestly don't know who he spoke with because i was at the office last week but he said he was working directly with somebody on making some hopeful updates or change request that he had put through last week that oh thats right if doctor matato is already maybe this person is looking into that that's really great so that could be so as of right now we do have a temporary we do have a temporary log in where we've trialed it a couple times just to see with with test patients we're not currently using it um because there's just some functionality that it doesn't quite have um at this point that when official before we were to maybe switch to try to doing something like that um we have been looking at other third party uh like in house kind of registration systems um that would maybe um uh be able to interface with cure md but before we go that route then that's why doctor matato talk to whoever he talked to last week from developers about making the kiosk on a little more robust instead of us having to go to a third party okay well if that's that's that's really great so i'm gonna go ahead and close the ticket uh and the doctor matato will definitely be following up with that person or that person would be you know that's the way it sounds yeah alright perfect okay

speaking how may i help you hey this is peter again from cure md calling in for elizabeth this is her hi elizabeth you've reported a ticket about some problems with uploading the documents correct yes okay i'm here to fix the problem can we do a screen share uh yeah let me log out of this patient's profile give me one moment please just gonna close down some of my apps real fast go to any desk dot com and download it give me 1 second here any desk download now mhm once you run it it will give you a 9-digit code can you read that to me 932515 124 okay please accept oh okay i can see it loading now alright so can you show me the problem i can see your screen now so when i'm in like cure we upload documents into the patient chart essentially but when i go into my cure file folder and i try to drop like something into somebody's file usually it pulls up a little screen that has me you know put in the document date and then hit save right but nothing worked this morning and and then i have two other main users that use cure we all use it through um internet explorer yeah and all three of us are having issues dragging or dropping files okay thunder cloud 10 okay alright one moment alright please log in now through chrome uh no just go ahead and log in over here okay can you please try again do you want me to try again dropping please okay sorry i misunderstood mhm let me check alright it looks like there's something wrong at the back end which you're not able to do it from the internet explorer browser um i'll have to report this film to our development team elizabeth is it just for you or there are other practice users facing the same problem there are three of us total that as of now all have the same issues um there's more users that use cure however us three are all having this issue and we're also the three that mostly drop files or upload pdf whatever you wanna call it okay uh have you tried doing the same thing on chrome because i think it's working over there so as a temporary solution you may do it from there i have um chrome there's another whole issue with chrome that's why we're still using internet explorer because as of like a few months ago chrome wasn't 100% configured i guess for lack of a better term so right now like when i go to chrome this whole thing comes up okay let me let me quickly check and fix this for you one moment thank you do you see a prompt on your screen can you press yes i can't press yes because i don't have an admin user name or password kick this out yeah pretty bad unless i got like a way better job somewhere i would have just stayed cash that in after like my 90 days or whatever it is the last looks nicer okay i see yep um there is um that karen declined utility that is asking you to download your utility is kinda old and to update it we need the admin user name and password if you can arrange that right now we can resolve the problem okay um i have to put in the ticket with my it no problem um let's let me give you another work around that you can try like if if you can uh specify under which folder you wanted to upload the document just select that document for example this one then go on your file and use this upload option as an alternative to drag and drop which will uh help you upload the documents let me see if that window that's strange oh we we log in onto the other browser i think it logged out over here exactly we we have this compliance um implemented at the back end to detect multi user logins that's one of the security features okay let's try again go into the document manager if you have a document to upload look for the patient for example this one and select the folder and use this upload button and then you can go for for that document from here and then you can select it and upload it from here can you can you just give it a try and see if it's working just to keep you up and running while we fix the problem from again the benefit of this workflow is that you can upload multiple files into the same folder at the same time yeah okay can you open just fine can you open this file i just wanna make sure that it's uploaded correctly yep it is okay so that's a workout for now uh just use it till the time we get this fixed or your drag and drop isn't working okay alrighty and um when will i know when drag and drop is working we will call you back hopefully by tomorrow i will give you a call back and i'll confirm with you um by calling you back to see if you're able to do the drag and drop now okay okay perfect thank you so much i appreciate it alright no problem have a good day bye you too"}}, {"id": 1108, "data": {"call_id": "1620674432.805715.txt", "text": "crowded room you find something your call is now first in line and will be answered by the

what you mean i'm sorry okay let me just enable that just give me one or two different versions 100 mg oral tablet how are you said two times a day two tablets for seven days alright so i have enabled the patient portal is there any way we can do a screen share session uh yes do you have any desk installed and was that doxycycline it's called any desk okay if you just open up google chrome and type

you just pull up curemd yeah thank you so if we you don't have that permission um yeah it's um oh am i not signed in as the right user oh it's right here sorry okay perfect so if we click on the settings then practice and the patient portal set up so if you copy this link oh and can you hold on one second sure okay copy just opening a new lane okay good okay new link i think the page is missing from the address h t t p okay yeah i got it remove it all there we go click on continue to portal okay so the patient portal has been enabled and if you go back into curemd i just want to show you a few settings so let me ask you this so let's say did you see the website on the right good meds okay so let's just say we click on and then we go to um start now did you see this form right here where it allows you to put in your patient info questions pharmacy and then payment how can we get that in here or like how can we put this kind of question thing on our website and log it's connected with curemd oh is it for the new patients mm yeah so let's say we have we have patients and they want to sign up on our website so they can just click on register now okay and this is the details that they need to fill this is what i wanted to show you on curemd so if we go back in so i can show you certain things for patient portal okay perfect so currently the things that we have enabled the homepage our staff practice forms if you have any in touch where you can put up the practice information the contact details register now and currently the patients can only enter their demographics information because if you get all these boxes are unchecked so let's say if you want them to add an emergency contact check this box if you want them to add their insurance information check this box so if you want them to add their history like medical history social history and stuff like that you can check these boxes and if you want to know about any allergies that the patients have you can check the last box as well okay great let's just select all that select all of it sure you can and if you want to change the arrangement just click on anything and if you want to move it above family history just click the arrow up it will move above family history and then i guess the landing page should be the home page or what um so if we go to home let me see what that looks like okay what is this health provider service that's not our that's not the location yeah i'll have to you know what we'll know let's not cover that right now because i'll have to get with deborah on that the business owner um but that's that information is not right and it seems like everything's just gotten mixed up here now let's just do self pay and is it how would we could we take um payment through the patient payment yeah yes this is a premium service if you're looking to acquire the service one of our premium teams member can get in touch with you and they will sign you up with easy pay through easy pay patients can pay their balances or their copay online hm okay and just to let you know in case if you do plan on changing the second location you can click on location so this is the health provider service if you don't want this check this box and hit delete okay oh okay it's that easy and it will disappear from the patient portal okay um so we editing this information won't change the information that we use internally mm as in what information internally i mean like um never mind it's okay in case you wanna change the name on this just click on this blue hyperlink like here and highlighted remove it type anything you want you can even change the address here you can change the timings if you want to make any changes to it okay and the access rights so i'm just gonna give you a quick review of the patient portal our staff you can put up pictures of your providers let's say you want to add a picture of deborah you can here select deborah you can write a brief introduction about deborah and you can select the file for her profile picture and hit save okay yeah i'll do that i'm unable to x out of it can you just x out of this page yeah there we go and the access rights is what you allow the patients to see on their patient portal okay i think it is stuck on the access rights so currently the patient's cannot see anything if you want the patients to message someone at the practice you can enable the messages tab okay and if you want them to see a list of all the providers check the providers tab and for the clinical it's entirely the practice consent as to what they want to show the patient you can allow them to see just their allergies or it's a history or the complete health record patients can also request medication refill from the patient portal okay and and if you select the provider notes there are two options all signed and selected signed so if you select selected signed notes you can upload certain provider notes that are signed onto the patient portal but if you select all signed all the signed notes will show up on the patient portal okay same as the case with the procedure radiology and labs for the appointments if you want patients to request an appointment from the patient portal cancel or reschedule you have the permissions individually okay any questions on this nope that's it and would you like to know how to register a patient for the patient portal uh yes so let me just verify if you have these specific permissions so i'm just gonna allow these permissions on deborahs account so permissions anyone that these permissions register patient and manage patient portal request i'm not gonna enable the message email because then the patients can directly send a message to deborah okay i have not checked that option so once saved you can click on any account will say is this your account um yes well that's my patient account let's go to my let's try a test account well no let's do mine sure which is um j oh we're looking for a patient sorry yeah i guess we could use me sure excuse me so once you're in the patient chart you can just hover over this patient portal create portal login oh you don't have an email address in the patient chart i'll put it in here that's okay sure go ahead and save taking a bit time mhm do we have to how come patients don't just automatically have their access of the emails on there any patient that has an email address in their patient chart you can just go into the patient's profile and click on create portal login mhm and you will have to choose to log in for the patients and once you have created the poor fishing portal login just hit send and they will get an email with the login password and the link which they can click on to join the patient portal well so what about the register the thing is that different that is completely different if you plan on sharing the patient portal link with the patients then they can just click on it and click on register now and they can just start creating their profiles oh um well so let's say let's say oh okay yeah great whatever so if we click register now does this if they register do they automatically get signed into their portal that is correct let's try it so i'm gonna integrity total name oh and this is where they be able to get it okay so let's 56343366 so i'm just showing you how it would show up for the practice date of birth is required so now it says registered registration request for how you sent or submitted successful okay now if you pull up cure m d i want to show you where you can go and see this request okay now if you click on the home page you will see an extra of tab patient portal request on the left tree menu expand that click on registration will we get an email alert no there are no email alerts but this registration would have a counter next to it so it displays the number of patients that have registered so currently we only have one so it says one so if you want to accept this patient click on here and hit accept and if you want to reject it just hit reject yes just type in test and the patient will get an email that your patient portal registration has been declined and if there is an existing patient in curemd with the same last name date of birth it will show you that this patient already exists do you want to merge this information with this patient or you also have an option to create a new patient okay no i think that's it perfect so can i go ahead and close the ticket yeah you can close it thank you and if you have any questions regarding the patient portal you can send me an email okay sounds good perfect enjoy the rest of your day thank you you are welcome bye bye"}}, {"id": 1112, "data": {"call_id":

you trying to add uh for ambat manage health services and what would be the address for this plan uh p o box 5010 farmington missouri 634 sorry 63640 alright um so the payer id for this plan is 68 069 uh can i know the procedure how to add this do you want to know how to add insurance no add the payer id in the CureMD well you don't add a payer id in CureMD you actually add plan associated with the payer id so in order to add it into the system you need to go to the settings module in your db and and under settings you need to go to billing and then plan once you're under the transaction yeah click on the add button and you'll get a prompt a dialogue box for you to look up for a plan now there's a search bar in the middle of that page where you can type the payer id 68069 which is the payer id for ambator and once you hit enter you'll it'll open all the ambator plans associated with this one as you can see uh since the payer id is the same you can add the the um any one of these like specifically the second one or maybe you know um it's somewhere down at the bottom and better from sunshine don't worry about the name because there's a possibility that the name at the card might be different but you can change the name however what's more important is that the address should be the same and the payer id should be the same okay actually uh uh i don't find any plans under the priority no match found did you clicked on the add button in the dialog box and then i end up i gave in the payer id 68069 and then i enter have you selected the state as all right right next to where you add the payer id right next where you have the payerr id you would see the the word state and a drop down so you need to change the state to all one second okay no it's i got it you got it yeah i got it alright you can add any of the don't worry about the name because like i said the the name might be different from what's on the card you can change the display name after adding the plan according to what's on the card but the payer id and the address should match so yeah it means all of these are basically the same profile just under the different names so you can just add any of them okay but uh it shows like uh 68069 in north c d do i need to select that yeah no worries n o c d is an internal code the payer id is only for the five numeric digits the last four alphabets

practice you're uh logging in as a patient portal yes to doctor shay uh lashkari shaye okay alright can i have your name uh my name is b pastor neck okay uh actually we do not deal with patients directly uh would that be okay if you can call the practice and they would be able to help you out with it i i previously was able to log in uhu okay they're not gonna it's it's a technical thing with the website alright okay even in that case um the practice would be able to help you out with it maybe they they weren't so that's why i'm calling you it says that this is not you personally it says that this is the support number i don't understand it says call support uh 7186849298 on the cure md website okay so um are you on the patient portal page or where exactly are you at i was trying to be what is the u r l that i'm supposed to be because this place has two u r l one for subscribe you know physicians and one for the patients where am i supposed to be alright can you confirm the name of the practice again i can show you the um place lashkari l a s h k a r i comma what's his name shaye s h a y e okay and and no problem and how okay thank you for your help it's very confusing because i'm trying to be two things at once right and i've had this problem previously okay actually i'm not able to find the practice in my system uh do you have the proper name for the practice oh wellness oncology wellness oncology yes i apologize no that's perfectly fine and i keep bookmarking the correct thing and then i you guys are like a moving target keep changing somehow even though i bookmarked the right place which goes to the other website i don't even know how it could do that search bookmarks so uh patient log in let's try this one uh yeah this one this one says security alert your session has been terminated so this was the ex ex expired session when i bookmarked it so that's why it's not gonna be the right okay then i bookmarked it again very busy with this twice bookmarks uh search box then i go to this one uh huh yes search let's try typing his in name here uh welcome to let's see i've got two choices uh let's try welcome uh sign in here come see it looks like i'm in the right place because i have my viewed saved logins then invalid and now it comes up with your phone number okay let me see i'm just trying to access your practice just give me a minute no problem thank you no worries uh search let's try searching again shaye is my user name is supposed to be uh case sensitive maybe that's the problem here actually um i cannot give you the information related to user name and password that is something that uh the relevant practice no i don't mean my user name i mean our user names a generic questions yeah they are case sensitive yes so let me just go ahead and see so which is uh uh website you're going to is it something related to cloud 14 dot curemd dot com cloud 14 cure md dot com but then i start out but i have bookmarked is it a cloud 14 dot curemd dot com slash patient portal something alright let me i apologize i am gpoing to look again the search bookmarks okay so the weird part is yeah patient portal site i'm leaving some lines out uh you know what what do they call those uh forward slashes so cure md forward slash patient portal forward slash site forward slash dot log in dot aspx right right so i've got your point um is that okay that uh maybe you can talk to the practice because what they can do is i do not have access to that they can simply send you the portal login details and the website again on your email address so once it's i have my i have access to my email right so actually they will send you the exact web address maybe it has been changed yeah you got no idea it's it's not as simple as you think the let me log back into my email the it's funny i remember calling here previously and having the same kind of conversation nobody seems to know about the patient side of this place i can i totally understand i do apologize for that actually um we are not allowed to talk to the patients that is the only problem because we do not deal with patients uh the practice directly deals with the patients and they tell them where to log in we only deal with curemd internal matters so uh the practice can contact us and let us know when we can help them out but uh the practice you've never spoken to a doctor's office if you think that that's all gonna happen anytime within my lifetime the let me i'm in my email and it took them a week to send this email to even subscribe to this thing uh cure md okay i have my last thing was a week ago so that i received an email from something cure md so let's see resend log in reset password update reset accepted so let's look at do you see any uh uh website link in that email uh i don't in update request accept i'm therefore i have only got four email regarding this whole thing uh so here it says uh no and then uh uh here okay your logins have been your login details have been reset user name okay so you're saying it is case sensitive maybe that's the problem okay welcome to patient portal but you know i have this thing bookmarked let's bookmark it again the one millionth time uh how's new york i think that's where you were is that where you are yes yeah um uh let's see shaye portal portal i'm making a new bookmark done okay bookmark this page better not touch that one okay continue to portal see this is how i ended up not being in the right place again okay oh yes do you see log in option up top yeah now i see the i don't know where this thing uh shaye um okay i'm in the almost certainly in the correct place now uh although it says my password is not that long submit let's look and see invalid user name or password you're sure it's case sensitive uh yes and uh we do not have those details only i'm not asking you for my password forget password let's see uh provide my email address okay so this is going to so if you put in your email address the user name and password will be sent directly to your email address okay so i don't have to deal with the doctor for the one millionth time okay oh so let's see uh submit okay your user name and updated password has been sent to your email uh how long does it generally normally here it is right here now i received two different emails as normal yes so one would would be with the login details and one would be with the password details uh got it okay so it appears that mine is very case sensitive not actually similar for all the uh practices so we are not allowed to send password and login details in the same email because that's okay of course nobody should do that okay so uh okay so let me log in here and see what's happening okay um uh okay so now it wants to change my password yes it will ask you to change to a new one okay uh and what choices can i put special characters yes you can okay so um did you get to that page where it asks you for the old password and then the new one uh yes i think i'm golden now although uh well that's in relative terms that you're asking about me personally but yes the so uh i'm just trying to enter the password okay the new password uh how many characters is the most so that i don't go nuts um like the maximum yeah the maximum it could be i believe uh 20 to 30 30 characters oh yeah i can't make it that long i may not survive typing so i thought you were gonna say whatever that number 240 76 or for a security i forget what it's called so uh okay uh and i can do special characters correct yes you can got it okay i'm gonna type this in show password and uh be done with this huh interesting uh it didn't okay update current password hm uh so type paste paste submit okay regardless i'm in for the moment alright that'll never happen again with this thing okay uh you can just write down the um you know user name and password somewhere so that uh you can remember that wasn't the problem the problem is the u r l the u r l okay got it yeah you should not have the same i don't mean you personally you should not have the same cloud 14 whatever um it should be something simple like patient portals dot com but actually they have quite a few practices so all the practices needs to have different uh patient portal addresses so that is why right and i i believe maybe uh the practice changed it of uh to a new u r l maybe that is why the old bookmark was not working properly hmm the i don't have no idea so uh okay alright i'm saying goodbye thank you thank you bye okay"}}, {"id": 1123,

you for calling Cure this is john how may i help you hey my name is devin i am from atlanta behavioral medicine um i had called you guys earlier um i guess the other day about um prescribing medication through the system and i i was talking to evan about it but i haven't heard from him this morning okay evan is actually not in today uh he'll be back on monday so uh give me one sec was issue resolved or no no is it with the controlled substance or no i mean so so yeah i'm having issues with both okay uh is there any ticket logged for this i've been calling you guys every day this week so i would assume so no but the ticket is actually logged from your end oh um well then i i don't know i guess not i've just spent like over an hour and a half on the phone with you guys every day so i'm not sure i haven't logged a ticket or anything what's the name of the practice it's atlanta behavioral medicine atlanta okay i think uh evan is the one who's been talking to you i believe he said he did spoke to you on wednesday i believe you said that you were busy with the patient right yeah yeah i talked to him for about 30 minutes and then i had to get off somebody was getting in touch with you okay mhm what kind of issue are you facing what because you're evan is actually the account rep for you and he's the only one who actually deals with your practice directly with anybody who has an issues but he's not in today so what kind of issue are you facing though what exactly is happening with the prescription um so i think um so we also have been in contact with dennis too and he's been helping me a little bit um but i emailed him as far as the controlled substances i emailed him my d e a license two days ago and i'm still not allowed to describe any kind of controlled substance um as far as the non controls um when i go into the progress notes or provider notes and click on the prescriptions uh it says i am not eligible to prescribe so what i've been doing is deleting the prescriptions and re adding them on every single patient that i have um and evan he had checked on his end too to see if it you know if it was my computer or something but you know he told me that i was doing the same thing on his end so it's not my computer the license um issues with your license let me have your full name so let me check your profile and if it's a premium services let me see if uh richard is available to assist you with this issue uh what's what's your full name please i can check the profile of my end first before i transfer you to richard it's d e v i n and last name perry p e r r y you do not have permission for controlled substances that's an one issue so you're not gonna be able to prescribe medications yeah but i should yeah it's just they

"doctors rama office how can i help you hi this is peter from curemd i'm calling in for victoria to check the scanning okay this is she hi victoria so you reported that the scanner uh is not scanning the documents in chrome that's correct i have to log on to curemd on chrome and so i can't scan anything under there oh okay so are you still not able to uh can we do okay so let's do a screen share session and uh let's fix the problem for you okay okay alright so um just go on to the website it's www w dot anydesk dot com and you will see the free download button there just download it and run

welcome to any desk 6.3 get started um yeah well normally oh you got it okay go ahead 592767 743 okay great i'm sending you the request click on the green button to accept it okay perfect i can see your screen now so um can you please go ahead and show me what exactly you're encountering while scanning so i come here and i try to scan and i get oh you know what now it's doing it i don't know because i have to i have to be logged on to um here on the internet so let me log off here because it wasn't doing it this morning uh let me see hold on oh he'll have to close it and log in again because you just take it out of the yes please log out and log in again i don't know i guess it's scanning now this morning it didn't let me just do like a test okay sure oh i guess it's scanning okay well um uh yeah i think you scan a blank page that's why i didn't show up can you try getting something with and i try to i'm trying to like if i had to do like a an id it wasn't letting me scan either but maybe now it is let's see we can do a test station if you like i don't have an i d but i can just do anything right hm so let's just say let's do insurance um no so here what do i have to do here uh just fill in the document date i understand it's a new screen that you're getting now but it's necessary to input the information so that we can scan okay but i have to do that no matter what right um yeah i took compulsory step now on chrome so then i hit scan scan i guess it's working now it wasn't working a while ago okay so it's here at the bottom that's what you scan so let's cancel it yep whenever you're done with scanning the window sometime doesn't pop up automatically so you'll have to click it at the bottom to to get it on the front okay okay alright and awesome again one more thing um so that you do not you know um get to wait for that long to wait for us to fix the problem i believe i believe the problem that you were getting was because of this curemd client which wasn't running and let me show you what the message was that you were getting once you click i think it was giving you this message that is exactly what i was getting exactly so the instructions are quite clear on this message that you're getting over here that please run client or download and install so because you were able to use it before it means that this curemd client is already installed on your computer and there's no need to download it so the only part that is left for us to do with that we need to run curemd client so how you can do that it's quite simple just press okay whenever you see this message and uh just minimize all the screens and get onto your desktop you have just curemd icon that says curemd client so it was telling us that we need to run this so you can just double click on it and it will run over here at the bottom and then you can go back into curemd and you hit scan and it's not gonna give you oh it's still doing it okay let me let me check that setting one moment so once we run it from the desktop it will start running and it will um you know make that message go away and it will take you to the next step where you'll be able to scan so okay so now i'm gonna double click on it because it it was asking us to run curemd client i double clicked on it let me go back into cure m d if i hit scan okay let me let me just refresh the screen and try again here we go okay okay so is that every time we log in uh no it it will run automatically if you want to see it uh let me let me just make some changes so that you can see it all the time running at the bottom uh here we go okay so whenever you power on your computer this icon if you take your mouse on it which is cure client utility it stays there automatically if in case you take your mouth on it and it disappears or if you don't see it over here it means that it is not running and most likely you're gonna get that message on the screen that you were getting before so it's very simple to fix the problem yourself just go onto your desktop and double click on this icon and that will run the curemd client if you get this message just press this i mean that's okay if you double click on it we can see two icons here right now okay here it comes only one now so we can go back into our application just refresh the page click on scan and it will let you take to the next step from where you can hit scan and it will work okay so okay so as long as i see the see on the bottom then i'm good but it's not just double click on it and it should be there uh yeah i mean uh just take your mouse on it if it stays there it means that you're all set if you see this icon and you're still getting that message it means that it's not running so if you take your mouse on it it will go away and you won't see it over here so how you can fix it you just need to double click on this icon okay okay just double click on it once you double click on it this will show up okay and if it's not there then you won't be able to scan so double click on it this will show up then you will be able to scan alright okay awesome thank you so much no problem in case of any further qyueries just log in your ticket or give us a call have a good day okay i will thank you you too you're welcome bye bye"}}, {"id": 1134, "data": {"call_id": "1620916091.852556.txt", "text": "your call is now
