sent you from invoices? it went to you and joe. yes, yes, i,<br>Agent: I saw that email and i was just waiting for for ed to. um, you know to respond to me regarding that so that i can at least um, if we're having a conference call, you know, i can have him in the call and then we could speak about this. okay, and also<br>Client: Ga, me, because know is the one i said. how do i let them know that i, we are finished<br>Client: With curemd, and my needer help. yes, for all,<br>Agent: Use<br>Client: What it is. okay, e that<br>Agent: Email<br>Client: Thats, and after her he asked heext to that and he said he to me, so yes, so<br>Agent: I, i said okay,<br>Client: I'm i'm doing that in right now and i'm ccing you in it. so that email that i sent to that jo. he told me all i needed to do is say please get discontinue invoices, as we are no longer using curemd. so that was actober before. oh, that was oct four. so honestly start, and i said because i shouldn't have to pay for this whole month because we're not even using it. he said exactlyly. so he said, you need to email them so that you will have that flag of. when you are. you do not want to you know curemd. you know any of else, and that's what i need to do. you said yes, yeah, we didn't<br>Agent: Even<br>Client: Need. i don't even so. honestly, i said that i, i get that the invoice in in in six two sixgo, i get the<br>Client: Data part of it. thank you, h.<br>Agent: But the<br>Client: Two four nine needs to be prered because as of october four t. i<br>Client: No longer w. services. yes, um, yes,<br>Agent: Obviously i saw that email, and um, you know that's what i was concerned about as well. and um, so what actually happened is that? the thing is that there have been like multiple email threads that has been running. and um, you know something in the middle. what happened was basically when i was going through all the email. um, you know from july, and where you were saying that you wanted to? um, you know, wanted to know your options for data migration, and also wanted to know your options for you know if there is anything, because i see that eddi, also, you know, gave you like two options where you know either you can have the account permitted and the data migration for the tof thousand and five minute dollars, um, to have it converted into a pdf if you wanted, or uh, you know, just a we pass. yeah, so data<br>Client: Migration is done. its completed like ifs yes, it's pa is paid for. we're done with yes, exactly. and<br>Agent: Then i see that uh, there has been a qutation given to you for for um, um, you know, the hundred ninety nine dollar a month for the read only access, but what actually happens is that, let's say that if it was if it was something on call, or you know if it was directly with the sales person, it's it's a different scenario. but let's see that, let's say that you know if i am sending you a quote that you know we are giving you. um, let's say the read only contract for the hunder, nine, two, nine dollar a month. like i would need a confirmation back from you that stateating that yes, you do accept that so that i can send it to the uh, the sales team and they can work on it, you know accordingly, and we can have the contract um, you know, made for you, as they, we only, but as long as you know we, we don't um, as long as we don't receive a confirmation after a qutation has been given to you, you know we. we are not able to proceed with this, because lets say you know you know. i'm not saying that this would happened, but let's say you know if we do create a contract and then, um, you know later on because we do have to pay for services as well, so on our end, so let's say that we do create a contract and then you know if the client is saying that they don't wanna go with the contract, so this is kind of you know contacting, so we do need like aritten confirmation from the client. that um, you know, they do accept or offer for the uh. whatever. the amount has been coded to them. okay, so we<br>Client: Need to get joe in on the conerence, because he told me. let's so we. i need you to set up a conference with you, may joe, ed, because we should, not, the only we should know for one time in november, because the only thing we need to pay for not you know of november bill is half of the data store, half the month dateta, storage. yes, uh, you.<br>Agent: Yes, because on<br>Client: On type or four tte, you know i did what joe told me to do. yeah, yeah, s<br>Client: The yeah. that's ri.<br>Client: Yeah, doctor sgal, just had that written confirmation on autto or<br>Client: Fourth. that's certain confirmation. i don't get need, and i have. i have listed and printed off, and our pea at tony, has everything, all emails, text messages, where i have been trying. actually, since last november before he closed<br>Client: The practice to get to get es tomments and how we get his data, and and we were put all around. our practice at returning, was actually getting ready to to, um, to<br>Client: You know, get in booveed if we didn't get our data and we, finally, you know, joey<br>Client: Reached out and that and we got it because we movegg that, but you know it was ridiculous, but i have every text messed. you know, every<br>Client: Email you know. so this is crdicialous. so the only thing that we need to pay for. and and and i want to cleared up today if they need me to. you know if hey needs me to sign something, so we don't want scy anymore. he should have sent that. yes, um, uh,<br>Agent: Yeah,<br>Client: And he,<br>Client: I would need a day stamp email. i would need to see an email forwarded again with the correct date of when he sent it. because i can get into you. you know, there<br>Client: Has been nothing sent to me since a type or four change. yes, i mean<br>Agent: The the last the last that i see is in september on september twentywentieth that. um, you know, direct gave you a call for seven, five hundred dollars for data migration that was completely separate, but um, let's let's talk about. um, you know, because data migration was already paid for in september and already been done on both of her end, so you know there's nobody liable for that and then let's move on to the um, uh, the read only contact that we're talking about over here. so for that as as you know, as i mentioned, that, anything that you<br>Agent: Know, if we want to proceed with any kind of uh decision that you're giving, we do need a written confirmation in the email that press this on<br>Client: November four. please letct this serve as aritten, request to terminate all contracts with cure, md. yes, okay, yes,<br>Agent: I have<br>Client: Already requesteded per other emails, so there is<br>Client: Yet another one so i should not have any charges for november. no, that that<br>Agent: I understand. that's what i'm saying like i, no, that that<br>Agent: That i understand. that's what i'm saying like i was concerned about the two and four in nine charge for the number number as well, so i would have to discuss this with the team and together so that we can. um, you know if theres, if if if curemd is are fallt over here, you know we can remove those charges. and uh, the only thing that i was saying is that because you know there there, there has been a misundersstanding going. because there are like multiple email threads, where um, i see the two emails that have been sent to us that state that you want to terminate the contract and then later on there are um. about like two or three emails. you know different threads where um. you know. uh, the team has been discussing um, the read only contract, so there is the the contracting, um. information that's been. you know. the misss communication that's been going around, but um, you know when you are here to? yeah, there is.<br>Client: There's no mis communication in this one where plly says all terminate all contracts,<br>Client: So that was sent on november fourth, the one on<br>Client: October fourth, t. and we need to get add in it so that's why you know there<br>Client: Should be no questions. i shouldn't have to pay anything for november. that should there shouldn't be. we should need one. don need need discuss that, because if i send this start practice in turny that, i mean, there's no even do it. i don't know.<br>Agent: I'm not. i'm like. i'm not saying anything regarding the email on the fourth of november. i'm saying the ones that were before you know. the conversation that's been running around from um september on september and october. you know where we have, like all of sta.<br>Client: It because aedd never gets back to me. that's the problem alright and have<br>Agent: You okay? so you you you? you got the confirmation that aeddie is going to be contacting you today? a tag? yeah,<br>Client: A lot. yeah, okay. so alright,<br>Agent: So what<br>Agent: I would do is that because you know he's working in a different department. definitely, you know there there. there must be some reason that he wants to talk to you now, or however, it is what i can do is that i will get in touch with eddie as well, and um, oh, because that<br>Client: Is the one that said i<br>Client: Said, how do i? you know how<br>Client: Do i start my services and i don't want any more invoices. he said, you need to invoid. send the email at invoices. bo off. and and i said well and i said. well, how are they gonna know? you know i need confirmation rerove, he said, pc. me in that, so i need you to get joe marrgin in on it and in on it and we'll do you know, a conference call every i, one of this. and and the only thing we're we need to work out because november is. there's shouldn't be any question. october should have stopoped on october four two and i still have not signed anything. so anyed, i still have not<br>Client: Signed anything. okay and i still have not been sent anything to sign if<br>Client: I have to sign something for all the contracts and yes, s. i'm<br>Agent: Not getting a<br>Client: Bag for paperwork that i don't even know if i have to have, because i don't know what the rules are. do you see what i'm saying like i don't know what youall need. and and you can't say? well, you didn't. you never signed this paper? well, i didn't know the<br>Client: Paper existed. yes, no, yeah, obviously,<br>Agent: Um, you know that's that's something that. um, you know. that's that's not. that's not an issue from your end. obviously, but uh, anything you know signed it has to be like a contract. and that's something separate. what i was talking about is just like aritt, confirmation through an email, because as as is, if i'm sending you something that, let's say that we are offering the service for hu to nine nine dollars a month. if you can just get a get a confirmation from your end that, uh, yes, i do accept to hundred nine nine do charge a month for the week only contract. then we can go ahead and you know, but anyway, regardless, we did receive your email on the fourth of november as well for the<br>Agent: Uh termination. now, the last thing that i wanted to ask you because i need to discuss this with any end internally in my department as well, is that, do you still want to consider the option for the read only access for your account? or do you want to terminate the account completely? no, that's why. on<br>Client: Acto four tea, i said, please stop sending all invoices. i dont want services. whatever it was i saying. what was it? yes, yes, i was<br>Agent: Typing that<br>Client: Email. joe told me what to say and then it canance. so i don't need any. we just paid seven b and five hundred dollar. it's never gonna work again. we we have what we need so it needs to stop. okay, alr, rightight, um,<br>Agent: I will go ahead, and um, you know, mark, that email that you sent on fourth november as the official request for you to.<br>"

okay, i'll find us. glad to hear from you again. alright, so jake was telling me you're looking to<br>Agent: See from<br>Client: Once since once the payments have been applied<br>Agent: And all of that stuff,<br>Client: So i'm gonna be helping out with all of that. first, i believe... the conclusion that we reached out onto. was when the settlement was made. so i believe if it's made in november, then we can apply from november, but<br>Client: If it's made in<br>Client: December, then we can apply it from december<br>Client: Onwards. so the previous ones had to<br>Client: Be bigger because we're... it's a really hard stretch that we got. you know, we had to take you off from... the six, i believe you had some $61,000 remaining on the penalty balance we had to, because you<br>Client: Told me that it's another practice. obviously, we're humans,<br>Client: Too. we understand that other people are also humans, and<br>Client: There is a possibility you might overlook while you're acquiring the other party. so there is a chance of human error, but catering to that, obviously, we also tend to make sure that we don't go in a business loss as well. to a level where we can be okay with that. and at the same time, make you guys feel comfortable. with the payment as well. so for this payment, i would recommend the way it says, i believe<br>Client: If we've reached out on december, you can start this 12 months from december, and you'll have the access until the<br>Client: Next 12 months. without any of<br>Client: The access. the experiment and you, we don't need that. but either was the sound, stretching vehicle animations, engines, comm kmk. that was convenient. some of those seemed to be thin. no, we'll keep the axis, because obviously,<br>Agent: If you're paying, obviously, we don't want to make that learning the race because we had to fulfill our part as well. so jay from the finance can make, you know, notice that. and make<br>Client: Your 12 months. account from the date of december onwards, and<br>Client: The remaining we would request you to make a payment. thank you very much. they would have to make payments<br>Client: For those two months to, on top of the balance that you've<br>Client: Ever agreed to receive payment for<br>Client: The next 12 months. yeah, so we're gonna keep it in my lap. yeah. i agree, but the thing is we gave the<br>Client: Notice on september 10th. and uh... and actually, actually, between we and you, we gave a notice even earlier. but nobody respond to us. but let's say september 10th.<br>Agent: ŒòŒ± luzŒ±œáŒ±Œ≤Œ¨ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ± occasions Œ¥œåœÅŒπŒø ils –ø—Ä–æ–¥ŒµŒΩŒ∑œÑ partial. and then<br>Agent: It<br>Agent: Took just two weeks to transfer it to uascar. after i called again and<br>Agent: Again once. so<br>Agent: And we said in the beginning, don't worry if we really need to pay<br>Agent: If we'll come to agreement or whatever, we will work it<br>Agent: Out. but yes, we did work it out. we did<br>Agent: Reduce it from 60 whatever, to... to 10,000, but yeah. we'll see you<br>Agent: Later at glen. [""i don't know if i'm<br>Agent: Going to<br>Agent: Miss this. yeah, but here's the thing. this is the situation i mean, like online coming from. obviously, the purposes we're getting to an agreement is because both parties have been straightforward with each other in terms of what they're expecting and<br>Agent: What they can do. now,<br>Client: As you know,, other businesses. or other parties were very eager to, you know, just take<br>Client: Whatever they can. they can amount<br>Agent: A different route to pursue the practice<br>Agent: In order to<br>Client: Get the payment done, but we actually analyzed. time and time again, we reduced it to 24 months. and then when you email that looked, this is a situation because we know<br>Client: Covid has hit everybody hard. and everybody's<br>Client: Trying to recover from covid. similar to what we're trying to do in the business<br>Client: As well,, we're trying to be in a position where if we made a contract with our business vendors. we don't want<br>Client: It to be into any billing ramifications. that then are hosting services and everything. the only edge you guys have is you have your own server. so that's why we<br>Client: Jotted down to a minimal level that we<br>Client: Can be okay with, and at the same time you guys can feel comfortable levels as well. the best thing we can do is you can pay the past two<br>Client: Months this december. and the other payment you can make in january. how about that? tak, wiƒôc trzymailenki<br>Client: Z't mammalselessiby, wiƒôc ko≈Ñczy insbesondere z accuracy, miles, ile, siƒô–µ–º—Å—è we talked about<br>Client: Three installments. that's a total life. yeah, the total amount. uh..., yet the total amount that we have here is twelve thousand, one hundred thirty a month that we have agreed upon, and twenty five fifty for october, november. so could we not just take three<br>Client: Payments for the total balance denominator?

Let me see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Trevor Smith</span></b>:  Yes, there is September 1st and voice is still pending.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And that was for 679, correct?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Trevor Smith</span></b>:  Yes, correct.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All right.  So here's my situation.  I just switched to QRMD.  I'm basically starting ‚Äì I'm an existing business, but I'm starting new, and that's  starting next week.  Right now, my billing inflow is very sporadic.  So it means that I don't know when I'm getting paid, because I haven't had that streamlined  yet.  So the insurance companies that I'm dealing with currently pay very sporadically.  I had recently ‚Äì I had a Medicare payment that was supposed to come in, but due to an  error somewhere in the system, they kicked it back.  So we ‚Äì listen, I didn't expect this to be smooth.  So it's always you have your kinks, but there was something in the QRMD process that was  a kink that got fixed and was resent.  So can I ask for more time to be able to pay this backed-up amount?  And hopefully I could pay ‚Äì I'd just catch up on both payments for last month and this  month.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Trevor Smith</span></b>:  Would you be able to give me like an approximate date that ‚Äì when it could be, so that at  least I can put it in the system and everyone would know that this payment will come in<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  approximately around this date?  All right.  So let's see, so it's 10 ‚Äì 10 to the end of Columbus Day and what's everything like  that.  So let's say for short by 10-20.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Trevor Smith</span></b>:  10-20.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Like I'll get ‚Äì because I'm adding in with the legal holiday and everything like that,  that usually backs me up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Trevor Smith</span></b>:  Yes, yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  That should work.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Trevor Smith</span></b>:  I'll put a note on the account to not send any reminders, because these are automated  reminders that go out so I have to go in the system and put a note over there.  So I'll make sure ‚Äì<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No, I don't mind the reminders.  I just don't want to get kicked off.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Trevor Smith</span></b>:  Yes, yes, I understand.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So because it's a whole process, if we keep sending reminders and then by the fifth reminder  it will get suspended automatically, so I'll put a note so that it doesn't get suspended.  And it shouldn't be a problem as long as we have the payment by either the 28th or  anywhere between 20th or 25th, it should be fine.  All right.  I appreciate it very, very much.  Of course.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Trevor Smith</span></b>:  Not a problem.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Trevor Smith</span></b>:  Yes, you're welcome.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Bye.

Liam, I received the last invoice from you guys, I guess for this month, PEN 123.  Can you look that for me? Because the invoice says that my charge is like 1805.99, but then it says that we have an account balance of $3,074.  But I don't know where that balance is coming from.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Sam Brown</span></b>:  I'm sure that you are referring to finance, right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes, it's our monthly invoice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Sam Brown</span></b>:  Oh, your invoice, right. So that means I'll have to involve our finance department.  So I actually would appreciate it if you could send me an email about it so that I can route to the concern department.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Can I not talk to somebody because I don't want that money to come out of my account if it's not necessary?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Sam Brown</span></b>:  Sure.

And in the meantime, I'm actually looking up for you if someone from our finance department is available right now to assist.  Just give me a moment. I'm trying to search.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay, and let me know if you got my email. It's from the company email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Sam Brown</span></b>:  Sure. And Renata, as I have you over the phone, I actually will not be available on Monday.  So if there is something urgent that you want to discuss, you can ask for Dave.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay, so how about the CCM things? Are you still going to have them ready for me by Monday?  Yes, hopefully. And we are working on it.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Sam Brown</span></b>:  And I'll be back on Tuesday and I on the same CCM thing, I will be giving you an update because on Monday I will not be available.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay, no problem.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Sam Brown</span></b>:  Yeah, sure. So as we speak, I guess that finance team actually has left.  So just give me a moment. I'm trying to search different persons as we speak.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Did you get my email?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Sam Brown</span></b>:  I got it. I got it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay. Yeah, because if you see the invoice say 1800, but if you open the attachments, it has.  Yes, Chris, that's fine. But there is one that you see that the account balance says 3000.  Yeah.  Chris is trying to get a hold of somebody. Go ahead, Liam. Sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Sam Brown</span></b>:  No, I actually was trying to get a hold of someone. And I also am going through the invoices that you're referring to 3074, $3074 the amount it says that you owe.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes, because they're going to take that money out of my account on the 30th. And I don't want the 3000 to come out because I don't know what that's from.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Sam Brown</span></b>:  Sure. I understand your concern and I'm trying to. Yeah. So Sam is available from finance department and I am forwarding your email also to him so that you can give Sam the reference that Liam forwarded him an email.  So that's what we are talking about.  Okay, sure. I'm transferring you. Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes, he's transferring me.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Sam Brown</span></b>:  Good afternoon, CureMD Finance. This is Sam. How can I help?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes. Hi. Hold on. Hold on, Chris. I'm sorry, just Renata calling from Senior Express here. How are you doing?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Sam Brown</span></b>:  Yeah, I'm good. Yes. So Liam was telling me that you had a question regarding the invoice?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes. So you guys have automatic payments taken out of our account. And I got the invoice and it's 2632 and that's our total. It's 1805.99.  But then at the end it says account balance due 3074 and 71. And I have no idea how you come up with this other amount because there is nothing else there.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Sam Brown</span></b>:  No worries. Let me just tell you. Give me a moment, please. So the first balance that you see $1805.99. That is for the invoice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay. The 10-1 invoice. And the rest of the balance, the total 3074.71 is for the complete account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Sam Brown</span></b>:  Now I see there is a pending balance from the MIPS invoice and all pending from that invoice. Then there is also a credentialing invoice, a 260.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, but we're making monthly payments on that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Sam Brown</span></b>:  Yes. Give me a moment, please. Let me just see why wasn't those payments charged. Okay. Give me one moment.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Chris. He's saying that from MIPS and the changing address, but I don't know why he's showing there and they're not taking out monthly like we agree.  So he's going to look into that. I'm on hold with them. Meanwhile, I'm going to look at their account and see what they are taking out and what they're not.  And the long and short of it is that they're taking out their billing every month. Yes. And we've been paying, you know, whatever extra something, you know, that that's gone, you know, so.  That's what I want to see when they lost the payment out and what was the amount.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Sam Brown</span></b>:  What's the deal? You know? Yes. Yes. Hello. Are you there? Yeah, I'm here. Yeah. I'm just going to put you on brief hold. Okay. Give me a moment.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  They're taking the money out but it's to show.  They took the MIPS out. They look like they only took the MIPS out. The other one they are taking 200 and paid out. But they do have a couple of.  No, we already talked to them. Now you're talking to Julie because she wants to see what they want to see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Sam Brown</span></b>:  Hello? Yes. I'm really sorry for having you wait. Okay. So I've seen in your account, you have a MIPS invoice.  So we had it was supposed to be charged on installments on a monthly basis.  Five hundred dollars each month. We missed. We missed to charge the five hundred dollars for the previous two months.  That's why the one thousand dollars for MIPS is pending in your account, which you're showing in the three thousand dollars.  And then there is one invoice for credentialing for which we are charging two sixty dollars each month.  Only one last installment is pending for that particular invoice to sixty dollars, which will be charged next month.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  November. So the two six dollars that came out of my account for this month.  So for MIPS, I don't know why you guys didn't do it. I think that one time the five hundred come out.  So I cannot have the one thousand all come at once. Okay. Okay. So if they want to run the five hundred, it's fine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Sam Brown</span></b>:  But then the other five hundred is going to have to wait for next month. Got it. Great. We'll go ahead and do that.  Okay. We'll child five hundred this month for MIPS and then five hundred the next month for the MIPS as well.  And then the last payment for two sixty will be charged the next month as well for the credentialing.  So that was the only balance that was included in the three thousand dollars.  And the rest is the the latest invoice, the eighteen or five point nine nine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah. Okay. So on the 30th only the 18 will come out of the account. Eighteen or five point nine nine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Sam Brown</span></b>:  That's correct. Yes. Okay. Okay. Should we go ahead and charge the five hundred today? Yeah, that's fine.  Okay. We'll go ahead and do that. Thank you so much. No problem. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Good day. Bye.  You too. Bye.<br>"

I don't remember the address  that I sent.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Trevor Smith</span></b>:  All right, that's not a problem. I'll go ahead and I'll reset the access right now.

Let me see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Well, there's no point, because I've been waiting for someone to send me a call.  I've been waiting for someone to fix this for past six weeks.  So there's no point in me issuing a ticket again, because nobody responds.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Trevor Smith</span></b>:  So if you could have someone call me as soon as possible, I'm here today till three o'clock.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Trevor Smith</span></b>:  All right.  I will let the team know to give you a call back as soon as possible, because normally what happens is that they need to get this resolved if there's a ticket in file.

I mean, how can I help you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm trying to talk to the finance team because I'm trying to figure out why is it so hard to get our bank deposit report every month.  I literally have to call every month for it.  It used to just come through automatically but now at the end of every month I would like it to come to us.  So I'm still waiting on members.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Trevor Smith</span></b>:  Understood. Can you give me a moment so that I can check this up?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Trevor Smith</span></b>:  Hey Theresa, I'm still here. I'm just checking things up, alright?  I appreciate your patience.

CureMD Finance, this is Trevor.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Hi Trevor, this is Theresa, Florida Medical and Allergy Center. How are you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Trevor Smith</span></b>:  Yes, I'm doing good, thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I was calling just so I could get our bank deposit report. I think I spoke to you about the last time you said that it would be December 27th.  Still haven't received it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Trevor Smith</span></b>:  Okay, so this is for the, let's see, just give me one moment.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  For November's bank deposit report, I still don't have anything. The last one I got was for October.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Trevor Smith</span></b>:  Alright, let me just look into this. Give me one second. Yes, okay.  So what happened was, because this was year-end and closing and everything was going on, so the December invoices were going out a little late.  They are working on sending the invoices either within this week. So it's either tomorrow or day after tomorrow the invoices are going to be sent out.  You will still have time to pay for the invoices, but we had to send the invoices a little later.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay, I'm not talking about the invoice. I want the bank deposit report, the money income for November.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Trevor Smith</span></b>:  Yes, exactly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm not concerned about the invoice, because they're going to come to us regardless, but I want our bank deposit report for November.  November 1st to November 30th. It's January 3rd. There should be no reason why we don't have that for that.  I want it today, I'm not waiting for it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Trevor Smith</span></b>:  No, I understand, but...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm not about to keep waiting for it. You told me it would be here December 27th, because they're running behind or whatever, whatever, and now it's January 3rd.  I'm not going to keep waiting, unfortunately.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Trevor Smith</span></b>:  I understand. I can let the billing department know, because that's the only way that we get the report from.  And because they are sending us the reports a little later, so this is why we don't have it yet, I'll let the billing department know to send you the...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Does the billing department have a phone number so I can talk to them and let them know how I'm mad about it as well?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Trevor Smith</span></b>:  I am the only person who can actually get this transferred to the billing team, so unfortunately this is something internal that I'll have to look into.  I can, once again, I can send it over to the team right now and ask them if the billing report is ready. I can have that sent over to you right away.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, because that's a little ridiculous. That's going on two months behind. So how long am I going to expect for December to come through as well?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Trevor Smith</span></b>:  Again, the January invoice for the December usage is going to be on time by the end of January, but it's just for the December invoice.  Once again, for the November usage from November 1st to November 30th, I will let the team know to have that sent over to you as soon as possible the way how it's been.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm going to call you before I leave at 5 today to figure out if that's done, because I want it done.  Okay, thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Trevor Smith</span></b>:  You're welcome. Have a good one then.<br>"

I'm sorry?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Can I have the name of the person?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Chiropractic, that's B-R-O-F as in Frank, T as in Thomas.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Okay, and your name please?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Daniel Bancroft.  I apologize. I didn't hear that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Just give me one moment. I'm just checking.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay, sorry. I thought you asked me another question.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  No, so basically Daniel, I need to check with someone on the finance team, but it's better if you send an email to them.  Because I cannot transfer this to them, but it will be easier if you just call, you know, send an email and they'll get back to you with that.  Do you have the email address for the finance team?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Uh, yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Can you transfer them?  I'm not sure. Usually, you know, let me check. Let me see if I can get someone.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I spoke with somebody.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  By any chance, do you recall the name?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I do not.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Okay, can you please read the name of the practice? Like, what's after Bancroft?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Correct.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  And what's the last name of the practice?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The last name of the practice? It's Bancroft Chiropractic. And my name is Daniel Bancroft.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Okay, thank you.  Check with the team and bear with me.  I'm so sorry. It's taking a bit longer usually. You know, we do not transfer calls to finance, so I'm just trying to get in touch with someone who can take the call.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I appreciate that. Although, when I called, it was on the call this, and I thought it was finance that I was calling directly.  So I apologize. I thought that's who I was speaking with initially.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  That's perfectly all right. Just waiting for a response from the team. Let me see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay, not a problem.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  All right, Daniel. I guess I've got Derek from the finance team, and I'm going to transfer your call for now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I appreciate that. Thank you very much.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  No problem. Please hold the line while I connect you, okay?  Okay, thank you.  Yes, hi. Javier.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes, someone transferred me to you. I thought I was calling somebody.  I called on 9-7 and received a call back on September 7th about canceling the service, and at that point I was informed that there was a contract, and she told me that somebody from contracts or something was involved.  Unless somebody from contracts, legal, something like that, got back something like that, but otherwise it would be 90 days.  So now we're with those just billed. I wanted to check on that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Okay, so did you put in a form of request to terminate the contract?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I know I talked to somebody because I wrote that down. I don't honestly know if I did that.  I spoke with the person that would get back to me if there was something else in September.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Well, because if anyone is wishing to terminate the services or to terminate the contract, what we normally need is a written email or a formal request to invoices at curemd.com,  and then we send it over to the legal department and they look at the contract and see if there is any determination fees.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You could have done all that. Can you look that up and see back within my account on September 7th who I spoke with and what notations that would have been done.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  I'm sorry? Can you tell me the name of the person you spoke with?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I cannot, but I can tell you my name and my account, so I assumed that they would make a notation in my account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Let me see if I see any...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It would have been on September 7th. At 10 o'clock to be exact was the call. He or she called me back.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  I understand. They called you back?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Okay. Alright, so what I would request right now to do is if you can send an email, the email address is invoices at curemd.com stating that to terminate the contract as well, right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Okay, so once you send in that email, please mention that and please also mention and then we can have an investigation or the research as to when the call was placed and we'll see what we can find on that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  But that has to be properly documented, you know, so if a formal request has to be made.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I understand, but like I said, with looking up my account, you should be able to see that, I mean, obviously requested to...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  What I see on the account, I do not see any such notations being made on this account. I can check the emails, but as I said, it will take some time and I cannot do it right now.  I would need to look...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I can tell you on my side, I said because, and I've never spoken with you, I don't believe, so I have been trying very hard not to be hostile in any way because I'm sure you deal with that all the time.  But I haven't even opened up the software since June, did a little bit in July, I left it up to August, I called in September, thought I could just cancel.  I haven't opened up the software since, I believe, July, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1 in March.  I would like refunded the last couple of months.  My card will not be charged in March.  I know you still have it.  I have such a moving forward.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Just to clear off, yes, your account is set up on auto pay and as per your call, I can put a stop on the auto payments.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I would appreciate that.  I can put a stop on that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Apart from that, as I said earlier, is in the case of termination or in the case of terminating the contracts, a formal request, which is normally sent to invoices at CureMD.com, that has to be sent.  On the basis of that, we can forward it over to the legal team and everybody who is in the retention team and the people who are looking into the clients who are actually terminating their services.  There's a lot that goes on once such a request is made.  Once we receive that, I will definitely see what is being worked on on that and we'll definitely get back to you over this regarding the issues that we have.  Once I receive that email, I can start the wall rolling.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Exactly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  That invoices.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  A thing or any one?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  No, that's completely fine.  That's the group email, so if I'm indefinitely located.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  I appreciate that, Derek.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Have a great day.<br>"

I've been trying to cancel my,  I've talked to multiple people and  emailed multiple times.  I called Chris to call this number  and to hopefully,  they didn't.  I retired  like five months ago.  I understand.  I believe finance.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  What is the name of your practice?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  My name is  Robert M.

Let me check if this is<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  already in the pipeline or no.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Alright. I'll be right back with you. Thank you.  Thank you. Thank you so much for  staying online, Dr. Yezir. Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay, this request is already in  process. The finance  is in the  email and few other  concerned parties are on the email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  So this is internally being rolled out.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I believe that you would be able  to hear back from us by Monday.  Yeah, can I ask you a question?  Does your billing cycle,  so do you pay for payments  for the upcoming month  or are payments taken out  for the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  previous month?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Not confident.  So I believe this  varies on practice  to practice and provider to provider.  Or there could be<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  one rule for all. I'm not confident  about this. Let me check with someone  in the finance department if they're<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  in for the day.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Give me one moment. Let me check with them.  I'm going to put you on a hold,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Robert, again. Okay.  All right.  We're going to take more money out.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  They can't do it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  But also, like,  companies are probably more liable.  Remember,  Caitlin bought that art supply?  They kept on taking money out of it.  How hard is it?  I should have just asked one time.  That should be it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Thank you very much for staying online,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Dr. Yezir. Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  One, I'll be transferring you to<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  the departments in the finance.  And two, what I am  informed with is that  if your billing  previously was done by  What they do is they take  I'm paid through my credit card.  I have no problem paying through  February, but I don't want to pay March.  I understand.  So that's why I was asking the question.  Okay. So they assist you with that.  And so they're saying that  those who are just using the software<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  are charged in advance.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The ones who QMd is doing  the billing for as well  are charged at the end of the month.  But I'm connecting you in the finance team  so that if you have any other questions on this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Okay. Alright. Thank you. Please stay online.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You're welcome. Hello there. Yeah.  This is Derek Hills with QMd Finance. How can I help you?  Yeah. My name is Dr. Robert M. Costello.  I sold my practice  September 1st.  I totally retired  the end of the year, December.  And I've called  several times. And each time I'm told  that they'll call me  back by the end of the day and they don't.  What I want to ask  is like, I'm  pretty sure I pay for the service.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Is that correct? Yes, that is correct.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay. Good. Alright.  Because I don't want to be charged for March  because I should have actually did this a while ago.  Perfect.  Same has to be in the pipeline.  I don't know what that means.  I just want to cancel my subscription.  Okay. Alright. I understand that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Sure. Let me just check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Have you sent a formal request to QMd?  I sent  multiple emails and I talked  to a couple of people on the phone.  Okay. Let me just check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Alright. So the email address that I see on<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  your account is costellochiro<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  CTR at outlook.com  bobcostellodc<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  at gmail.com<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Okay. I can add that. Do you want me to remove that one?  The one I already told you?  Well, not for...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It won't really matter because like I said, hopefully  by today this will be resolved.  Okay. Because  the reason I asked is because I wanted  to check the emails in the system.  Okay. Yeah.  If you could communicate with me  like I said, I don't go to the office anymore.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Just a moment.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You said you sent  emails regarding this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Could you please tell me the email address<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  with which the email was sent?  I sent it to enroll  at QMd and then  I told it that...  The communication<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  that I first sent<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  was enroll at  CureMD.com and then I was told  to send it to supportCureMD.com  so I sent<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  them both.  Alright. Perfect. So you must have a copy of that<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  email to invoices  at CureMD.com.  Hold on a second. Okay. Is it all lowercase?  Yes, it's all lowercase.  That's invoices  at CureMD.com.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Invoices with the yes at the end<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  at CureMD.com.  Okay. Alright.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  And then we can take care of it. I will have<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  the process expedited and  I'll make sure that somebody<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  gets back to you or you get a response on that email for sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Alright. Thank you buddy. Appreciate it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Derrick Hills</span></b>:  Thank you. You just need to make sure<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  that you email that to us. I will do it right now.  Alright. Thank you.  Have a great day.<br>"
