I was just going to help you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Hi, this is Andy from CuriMD.  Can I speak with you on the Salinas, please?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Yes, give me one second, sir.  Sure.  Hi, this is Dr. Chisholm.  Hi, Dr. Chisholm.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  This is Andy from CuriMD.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  How are you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  I'm fine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  How are you doing?  I'm fine, thank you, Dr. Chisholm.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  It's the call regarding the support ticket  log by Salinas that you want to make some changes  or update your forms.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Yeah, more or less.  My letters, they're coming out kind of funny.  Even if I edit them, there's some things<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  I need to change each time.  OK, so is it possible for you to share your screen?  Let's do it if you have time.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Yes, of course.  Any desk?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Sure, so it's been a while since I do this.  I clicked into the Any Desk icon,  and then I say my address to you.  Is that right?  Yes, yes, yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  OK, I have 1030991 833.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  You'll receive a request.  Please accept that.  I can see your screen.  You can pull the CuriMD application  and let's talk them out.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  So would you like me to show a test patient<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  and how it comes out, or do you want  to look at the templates first?  Yes, let's go to the test.  You can show me how it comes out, then we'll go to C.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Very good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  So I'll just do test, usually use this one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  And then mainly a problem with letters, I want to add a letter.  And then thank you for consultation.  And this, it comes out like this every time,  where we have to remove image.  And this is a bad example, but normally, well,  that's one thing, just having to unclick that and remove<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  that image each time.  So do you want to remove that image permanently?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Yeah, just because it's no longer working anymore.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  I think it had our logo at one point.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Unless you're able to fix it, it used to have our logo.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  OK, so we can add the logo from the back end.  Like if it's added in your database,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  then we don't have to attach the image directly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  We can place the logo on the top of your letter template.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  OK, good.  And there is another thing I wanted to show you.  I just need to find the correct letter that's messed up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Let's try and see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Request for consult, maybe.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  It's all coming out fine on this one.  It's funny.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  As soon as I show you, it doesn't mess up anymore.  OK, so what you can do, you can just  clear the cashers and cookies off your system.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Sometimes it happens to you that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  And the letter you told me is a thank you letter, you said?  Thank you for consultation, right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Just a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  But I would like all the letters to have our logo on it.  Yeah, it will come up just a minute.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Basically, I cannot see the, which one is it?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  I think it had a women's clinic in South Texas  with the Incontinence Center Menopause Institute.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Which one is it?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Oh, you're trying to find the thank you consultation letter?  Yeah, it is right there at the bottom.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  At my end, I cannot see the image.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Strange.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  And let me add this.  I'm not able to add it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  I don't know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Practice logo, practice logo is not added into database.  Basically, a full image header I can see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  I'm going to check something out.  Let me just, I'm going to try and show you  in a real patient because there is another issue<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  I wanted to show you.  I just wasn't able to recreate it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  On my screen, I have the logo currently  on the mammogram referral, the way it used to look.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  I got it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Just give me a minute.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Let me do that for you quickly.  Be with me.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Yeah, go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Save this image on your desktop.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  This one is done.  And which one is the other one?  And can I align it?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Basically, I guess I would like it  to replace the title I have there, Women's Clinic of South<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Texas.  Because it's like just to delete it and have<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  the logo replace that.  OK.  Make it centered if possible.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  OK, basically, given the spaces, they did not make,  they did not align them properly.  So that's why whenever you're going to print them out,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  they will come out like backward or on the left side.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Right, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  That's what I was trying to show you last time,  that those addresses there of the two clinics  are always shifted to the right of the screen.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  And I have to fix them every time.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  It's just it wasn't happening anymore  when I was trying to show you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  OK, no problem.  Three rows, five of the two columns, that's fine.  I will make it disappear.  Don't worry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  OK.  Don't worry, it will not show up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Last time with whom you spoke, last time with whom you spoke,  like the guy he spoke with, I showed him the things.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Oh, well, I had added those letters myself,  or I had modified them when we opened the new clinics.  I guess I was the one who messed it up, maybe.  OK, OK.  Yeah.  I was trying to clean up our letter templates.  But we were having some issues prior to it also,  with the image thing having to be deleted every time.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Well, it's not getting disappeared.  Now I'm curious.  All right.  OK, so we have this way.  I can't go down.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  OK, I'm going to bring this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  This is enough, Doctor?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Yeah, it looks good.  OK.  Is that how it'll print out?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Will it look like that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Or are they going to be freestanding?  Or is that grid going to be there when we move the letter?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Let's see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Do you need that grid to appear?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Basically, I tried to hide it as much as I can.  So let's see if it comes or not.  Let's go into the test patient quickly.  Clinicals.  It's coming where it is coming from.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Strange.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Already moved it.  I'll go for the print.  I just want to see where that image is coming up now.  Image thing.  It's coming somewhere here.  No, probably don't want that grid in the final paper.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  I know this is the site where you make it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  No problem.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  I like it the way it looked initially with the addresses.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  OK, no problem.  I'll do that.  Just a minute.  I'm creating a whole new template for you.  Basically, that thing which is appearing  is not looking good to me as well.  So what if I'll give them horizontally?  Should I paste it like this?  If it's OK with me, then I will do it this way.  Let me complete it on your screen,  and then I'll show you what I'm talking about.  So let's do this.  Center aligned.  Full image.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Here, I'm just going to step away for one minute,  and I'll be right back while you do this.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  No problem.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Take your time.  OK.  OK, I'm back.  OK.  Then I have to reattach the flags.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  So that's what I'm doing right now.  Align under here.  Space.  Things looks fine.  OK, so let's do this first and see how it comes up.  And then we can remove the previous one,  and you can use this one.  Hopefully, the image will not appear.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Here you go.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  And the logo with our clinic name  will be on top eventually.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  This is how it's going to come up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Ah, OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Let me print.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  That looks pretty good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  I think that looks fine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  I'm OK with the addresses like that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  They can't be arranged the way I had them.  It causes too many problems.  No, it can be.  It can be.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  If you want me, I can do it that way, but in one line.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Oh, I see.  They have to be in one line.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  One line, and I can segregate them  by putting the hyphen or some kind of characteristic.  I think this looks all right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  I don't know.  I'll have some other people look at it<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  and make sure they agree.  We can put it like this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Sure.  Can you show me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Like address, the way it's going to come up.  I'm just going to give you space.  This much better.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  I don't know.  And maybe having a space with a telephone fax number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  That can be done as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  I don't know.  I meant like by pressing Enter between the two  so that there's a gap between the lines.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  We can do that.  Like this?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  It works.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  OK.  And maybe no, that thing there you  can remove between the numbers.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  That thing?  That line.  OK, the line?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Yeah, yeah.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  We can do that.  We can do that.  We can do that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  And we can remove the one you are using before.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  First, let's do this.  This much space is enough?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Yeah, I think so.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  I guess, yeah.  This works, right?  I think so.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  I like that little space you had between the addresses,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  like that line there.  And let's try.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  OK, very good.  So we also have a problem when it says electronically signed<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  on the bottom.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  It just gets cut off, and it just says signed.  And so I'm having to physically sign things when normally I<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  didn't have to in the past.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Like ECC there says signed by Dr. Chisholm  at the bottom in green.  And some templates come out electronically signed,  and others say just signed.  I want them to say all electronically signed.  The thing you are talking about, when<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  you sign the provider note, it comes out electronically  signed by Dr. And in letter template,  it comes out signed by Dr., right?  Yes.  Yeah, it's a different workflow for both letter templates  and note templates.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  So say electronically signed when I print it?  OK, I see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  All right, fair enough.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  OK, well, good.  I know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Let's remove the older one first so there will be no confusion.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  This one, so we can delete this one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  There you go.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  And we can change the name now.  So any other letter template where you want to put the logo?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  I mean, pretty much all of them.  I'm sorry to ask that, but that's all we needed for,  basically.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Right now the one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  We can have the same layout.  Same layout.  With the addresses.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  So right now the address is coming.  We can take out the practice name.  So this is as per your location.  So I think we can leave this one as it is.  And if you want me to add the current location address one,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  current location at the at, at that time<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  and creating this data template for the patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  I don't know.  I'd rather just have both.  I'd rather just have all letters look the same at the top.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  OK, so you're just.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Can't we just replicate what we did last time?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  No problem.  So no one is using the provider?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Yeah, no one else.  I mean, nurse practitioners and stuff are using them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  That's fine.  That doesn't matter.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  And I'm sorry, I have some patients waiting right now.  Is it OK if I leave you to it and I can work here?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  If I can use your screen?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Yeah, go for it.  Is it OK if I log in on another computer to look at patients?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  No problem.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  I don't know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  It will let me work on it or maybe kick me out.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  OK.  Well, we'll see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  All right.  I got to get going.  Never.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  Thank you.  Thank you so much.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Bye.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Womens Clinic Of South Texas</span></b>:  You're welcome.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Andy Turner</span></b>:  Bye.

You asked me a question.  I responded.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  So, I just wanted to know that how do you guys work?  If there is any request for participation submitted, there is no room for the new providers.  So, do you reach out to providers to notify them that the panel is closed or you do not  reach out?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So, it's not about reaching out.  The problem is that we get thousands of applications.  You submitted an application.  Let me review your application.  Give me one second to see what you submit.  I mean, I got the application.  I just want to see your complaint.  Yes.  Give me one second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  I just wanted to let you know that there were actually three applications submitted for<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  three of our providers.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  One of our providers is no longer with us.

So, one, are you a consulting firm?  Because I don't discuss with – we don't normally – we would need to sign an NDA  if you're a consulting firm.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  I'm actually a third-party detention company.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  So, you would need – for me to release any type of information to you, I would need a  business-associated agreement in place for me to release any type of information pertaining  to any of our providers or any application.  We don't submit – I understand that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  And we do sign – So, we've talked to our insurance provider.  – with some of the other insurance companies and they'll share that with us.  And now we'll go ahead and sign that, okay?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Now, I only work with – so, okay, so let me just explain to you a little bit.  You can have an understanding how this thing is going to work.  Hold on one second.  Hold on.  I need to see if the complaint is committed.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So, I'm only going to talk about purchasing into the complaint, okay?  Three months ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  What was that, I'm sorry?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So, I'm only going to discuss – Okay, we're in an application process.  Okay.  So, this came to us for – give me a second.  This is Michael, right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Michael – We actually listed two – like, we mentioned  that there were two providers, Michael Cruz and Russell Tobey.  These are two behavioral health providers.  And for these two providers – but initially, for three providers, we submitted the application<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  to – I want to know the complaint.  I only want to know what is the complaint.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  The complaint is – The provider is –  The complaint is – Not a general complaint, because if it's<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  a general complaint, that has to be handled a little differently with our legal department.  If it's provider-centric with specific providers, then that's how it's coming to me.  For provider-centric, then we will handle it different.  So, the way this came to me, it was for Michael, right?  Okay.  So, we have Michael, and we have – hold on – and he's an MD, correct?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Michael is an MD, psychologist.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Correct.  And he submitted an application on 523, on 723, have not yet been contacted.  Okay.  So, let me tell you how the process works.  Those are not applications that you're submitting.  You're submitting a request to become a network, all right?  That's it.  That's what it is.  It's a request for you to become a network.  Okay.  We would review it, and we would determine if it's a need, if it's not a need, if  the provider is going to get a contract or the provider is not going to get a contract.  Because you submitted a request, does not mean that you are guaranteed a contract.  You are not guaranteed a contract, okay?  Okay.  You submit the request, and sometimes these requests – during the time that you submitted  this request, we were going through a transition from Anthem into Caroline.  So, we were going through a high transition, and the application is still pending, okay?  Okay.  So, I can just start.  The application is still pending.  So, I do see the application.  Hold on one second, and then let me pull it on my end.  Okay.  I do see the application.  However, this is another thing that happens that is not something that – you know, I  send you a contract.  You may not agree to those rates.  Our rates are very low.  So, it's not very specific to what you want a contract for.  Do you want a – the provider is located in New City?  Yes.  I'm fine.  I don't – you know, I'm okay.  I just need to know.  And this contract that you're requesting is for what lines of business?  Okay.  First of all, you mentioned that whenever a request is submitted, that doesn't guarantee  of network participation, okay?  And I know that.  Correct.  Okay.  And I know that.  So, it doesn't mean that we have submitted the request, and it will be a guaranteed participation,  okay?  Like you have mentioned that, it just went to the department for review, either to get  a contract or not, okay?  And since you have mentioned that, you guys notify even if you guys will be accepting  it or not, okay?  But as of yet, we have not received any single correspondence from any person.  Okay.  I'm responding to you now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  After a year – after a year, when we submitted the application to DHS, we have submitted<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  many escalations, many complaints through the call center department, but those were<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  not – you know, we were not answered about that, okay?  You mentioned that you were – like there were some transitions and all that, but if<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  there were some transitions going on, then you guys should pay attention to the providers  as well.  Even if we submitted the complaint, even if we submitted the complaint, but unfortunately<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  there was not even one single responsible person who can reach out to us on those escalations<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  or complaints.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  That was the –<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You're not the only one.  You're not the – we have 5,000 –  Okay.  That's not –  5,000 providers.  I understand that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  I would not talk about – I would not talk about other providers.  I'm just talking about my providers, my –<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That's fine.  It's okay.  Yeah.  I understand what you're preparing for.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  If this is something – if this is something generally you should guys – you guys should<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  post on your website as well that this is currently be our patient.  I totally agree.  That is something that I am totally in agreement.  However, I am not the powers to be to make that decision.  I am a contract manager.  I just got Rockland County effective in February.  So I didn't even have your account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  The thing is now when we submitted the complaint to the DHS, now people are reaching out to<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  us.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Why you guys would not contact us before?  This is something that we have to push to work.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Because there's a backlog.  There is a humongous backlog.  There is a big backlog of applications.  That's why.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  So you guys should –<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't have any control of that.  Unfortunately, I don't have any control of that.  I don't make those backlog decisions.  I'm here to help you.  I mean, Rockland County, I would accept his application.  Yeah.  And I would definitely offer his contract.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  So it means that every time we have to push you guys to work and we have to submit the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  complaint, you guys won't accept the formal explanation?  You're not pushing the means to work.  I'm working.  I'm working.  I work.  I do negotiations.  I do high-level negotiations.  I'm working.  This is not that people are not doing their job.  The problem is here that a thousand applications for one person to manage is not manageable.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  So you mean to say that it can take up to a year for you guys to reach out to –<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't have control of that.  I don't have control of those decisions.  All I can do is help you now that it's coming to me because now it's coming to me.  I can move forward.  I cannot – you know, I can't – that's a process.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  No, I need to know the process because we have other providers as well for whom we have  – this is something that you've just mentioned that there's a backlog.  So just asking you that it can take up to a year for you guys to respond, right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It's been more than a year now.  I've made those suggestions.  I've made those suggestions to our leadership.  I've made those suggestions to our leadership.  I said it, put a stop, you know, have a disclaimer go out so providers don't think.  I've said all of this.  All of this that you're saying, all the contract managers have expressed those same concerns.  We do advocate for our providers.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Yeah, I understand that.  And even if you are entertaining your provider in the order they are received, so it's been  a year now and we didn't get our turn for you to – and this is quite interesting that  after submitting a lot of complaints – Well, on 523, I'll be honest with you, on<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  523 and on 723, I didn't even have Rockland County.  So it would have never came to me directly.  It's coming to me now because I have Rockland, but I didn't even have those counties.  So I'm new to this county and I live in this county, by the way.  So, you know, I'll be happy to contract any provider that comes in in Rockland County.  You know, I know the need that we have in Rockland County.  So, you know, I'll be more than happy and thrilled to contract all providers in Rockland  County, but unfortunately, they have a process, the company has a plan that these applications  are through the portal, you know, by the time it gets to us, you know, providers are already  complaining.  We understand that.  I don't have control of that process.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  So is there a way if we can send me that complaint to the leadership so that they must know that<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  they need to think about that?  It has.  It is very impacting us.  Okay.  It's impacting you guys, but – and I understand now.  I totally understand.  I'm not talking about the re-architecture company.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  It is talking about the doctors.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Let me ask you something.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Let me tell you some of the things that happen here when providers submit applications and  then they get a contract.  So I'll tell you how it used to happen.  You would submit an application online in the portal.  You would automatically get a contract, right?  You will automatically get a contract.  What they were doing, they weren't sending the contract back because they didn't like  the fee.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  What is this?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Do I do the contract or do you send it back?  It's a lot of work to put a contract together.  We're talking about 100 pages depending on the line of business that you're working  with, depending on the type of contract you want.  When we're talking about full-blown contracts with commercial, government lines, we're  talking about 150 pages being sent for providers with fee schedules that are not being returned  to the company.  So you understand that and all because they don't want the fee schedule.  So they created this process where now providers go online, they submit it, it comes to us  to contracting.  We send the application and we send the contract out together at the same time.  But now I need to have a phone conversation with you, right?  Because I can't send you a contract that you're not going to send back, right?  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  So now what can you do at this moment in order to get these two practitioners to get contracted?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Who is the provider again, I know the one in New City, who is the other provider?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  That is Russell Taube, do you need his NPI?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Where is he located is the question?  He is in the New City as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  He will be performing services there.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  In New City, okay.  In Rockland, okay.  There are both of them.  Okay.  I was just wondering because I had a provider in Brooklyn because that wouldn't be me.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Yeah, no, it's you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That's why I was like, not a problem.  I need you to send me your NDA, I need you to complete a business disclosure agreement.  And that's another situation too.  That's not available on the portal.  We can't give company provider negotiations to a third party.  You understand?  And by the time we get this, that third party doesn't have a business associate agreement  with that other provider.  Sometimes we're forced to make negotiations directly with the provider.  And we have every, we also reserve the right to reject a NDA as well.  You know?  So, you know, I get your frustration.  I understand it, you know, but you know, as much as you're frustrated, trust me, I am  also frustrated because it's not fair to us either as employees.  Okay.  But I will be more than happy to work with your providers in Rockland County.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  And I hope once that NDA is signed, you guys won't take now, you guys won't advise us to<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  allow 30 days, 60 or something like that.  It must be completed within a week to.  No, you can complete the NDA.  You submit a DOH complaint, a DOI complaint.  So this complaint needs to be responded to.  So you have, it's taken on your end because we have to close this out by this week.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  So yes, I am expecting once, we are expecting it to be for the contract to be received,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  expected date should be for the PAD.  We will send you a contract until that NDA is completed.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Of course, I got it.  So one, if you, you're going to send me the NDA form today, I will return that to you  right after that, and I will wait for the PACTAs or the provider's agreements.  So once you send that to me, I will send those to my doctors and they will have them reviewed<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  and sign those and will return those contracts to you guys.  So I won't send you the contract.  No, you will sign the NDA and then I will give you what we reimburse.  All right.  Because I'm not going to, let's just say you don't like the reimbursement, the providers  don't want those types of reimbursements, then there's no point of sending your contract.  The rates are what they are, and that's what we're going to pay for any new providers that<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  come in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Just send me the NDA forms and I will sign that and you can just send me the proposed  rule rate and I will check with my doctor and if they agree, I'll send you an email<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  that it's confirmed.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  And so will those agreements be in electronic ones or the paper ones?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It would be electronic.  The agreement would be electronic.  But first I'm going to send you some.  But you have to tell me, is this a solo provider or is this a group?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  It's a group.  It's a group.  How many?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Are they part of the same group?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Right now there are two behavioral health providers, Russell Tobey and Michael Kruse.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Are they part of the same group?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Yes, they're part of the same group.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  So they're getting a group rate.  And they're both MDs?  Yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  The one is psychiatrist and the other one is psychologist.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Hold on one second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Psychiatric, I'm sorry, give me one second.  I'm trying to send you this while I have you on the phone just in case you have any questions.  Of course, please.  I don't want to like...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Because now we cannot sit and wait.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, but unfortunately there's a lot of providers...  Please, I request you just that don't like...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Have I tried not to respond to our emails or habits and we have already tried your...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm one person and I deal with thousands of providers.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  And after wasting more than a year, we are expecting that when our...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You got it.  If you want me to...  We have to be able to work together.  I understand your concern.  I'm addressing your concern, but...  And I will reply as I can.  I'm trying to send you this and...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  I'm waiting.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh my God, it's not...  Give me a minute.  I'm so sorry.  I'm going to have to send it in a new email.  I don't know why it's doing this.  Let me try to do a new email.  Your name is Ross?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  My name is Russell.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Russell.  I just emailed you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Yes, you just emailed me today.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  Okay.  So it's going in...  Okay.  Okay.  One second.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Maybe the people working prior to you on the Rockland County, they just got their checks<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  and they just flew away.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  The people working prior to you at Rockland County, they just got their paychecks and<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  they just ran away.  No, that's not how it works.  Everybody here has been here for more than 10 years.  Okay?  No, why?  Because the Rockland team has been here for 10 years.  I don't know why, but it's not just opponents.  And with all due respect, we all work very, very hard and unfortunately, no control.  To be very honest, it doesn't seem like...  You can't come to the ball.  It's not...  But you want to understand too, it's not our fault.  We don't create the rules.  We follow them and if they work, then great, they work.  And if they don't work, that's not something we've created.  Okay?  So with all due respect, the thing is, how we send you a contract, we're going to have  to do it.  Okay.  So I'm going to send it in a new email.  Okay.  So I'm going to send it in a new email.  Okay.  So I'm going to send it in a new email.  Okay.  So I'm going to send it in a new email.  Okay.  So I'm going to send it in a new email.  Okay.  So I'm going to send it in a new email.  Okay.  So I'm going to send it in a new email.  Okay.  So I'm going to send it in a new email.  Okay.  So I'm going to send it in a new email.  Okay.  So I'm going to send it in a new email.  Okay.  So I'm going to send it in a new email.  Okay.  So I'm going to send it in a new email.  Okay.  So I'm going to send it in a new email.  Okay.  So I'm going to send it in a new email.  Okay.  So I'm going to send it in a new email.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  So the NDA that you are sending, is that an electronic one or that's a PDF one?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Agreed.  Okay.  So I'm going to give you most of, 90% of it.  I'll give you the breakdown.  The rest of the breakdown once you return the contract, because that's also a different process.  I don't want to compartment with a whole list because I want to simplify it and you guys may not want to contract with us.  May not?  May not?  No, you may not agree to the rate.  Okay.  So you may not agree to the rate.  So I don't want to give you more than what you need at the moment.  Okay?  All right?  Does that make sense?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Is that fair?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, but we can request for some higher.  No, the rates are what they are.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Whatever you are sending, that would be the final one, right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That would be the final.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Oh.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  This is the final one.  Okay.  So we had so many contracts being sent out and with so many providers, but these providers were never sending them back.  You understand?  So they had to change the process.  Okay.  So now I have walked to each and every one of those.  Okay.  So I'm going to give you a little bit of a background.  So I'm going to give you a little bit of background.  Okay.  So I'm going to give you a little bit of background.  Okay.  So now I have walked to each and every individual provider.  I have to review it.  It's a longer process now because a lot of the time providers never used to send it back.  Do you understand?  Uh-huh.  I got it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  I'll be waiting.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  So imagine you're waiting a year and we've been waiting two years to get contracts back from providers.  They never signed them.  So that's their choice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  They don't want to get that signed, but you guys should follow those agreements.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes, but it takes time and money to send out these contracts.  So it wasn't being resourceful the right way where we're just working and sending this stuff out, but we're not getting this stuff back.  So that's why I say, I want you to kind of have a clear understanding of our struggles as well.  And I wasn't part of that and I wasn't part of that team, but they did work very hard to submit auto contracts and send them out through an automated process.  When that was happening, providers weren't sending them back.  So how is that fair?  So now we have to change the – leadership has to change the process and now have it sent directly to a contract manager.  And that is kind of what is creating a – that's creating a big backlog because it's impossible for one contract manager to – you know what I mean?  And work on the goalsheets out.  So it's not – I don't want you to think that people here on the contracting team are just not doing their job.  No, we're working and we're working till 10 o'clock at night.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  So it was we actually who actually found you after multiple attempts.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  What happened?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  I told – I said that us who actually found you after multiple attempts just talked to a network manager.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, yeah. And I'm very responsive and I'm also very, very transparent.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Let's see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm going to tell you what it is.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Let's see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So you can both have a clear understanding and be patient with each other, right?  Because you have to work.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Let's see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Right?  Like, you know, and I'm really happy.  I get really excited for contract providers in Rockland.  So I do live with them, you know what I mean?  So I know that you need to talk to them.  Great.  So be happy that you got me.  Yeah.  But I just want you to kind of be patient and know that, you know, it's a lot.  It's not a little – we're not talking about point providers.  We're talking about hundreds.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  And I hope we are not interacting today because we have to be, you know,  in contact for these two providers until their contract gets executed.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So we have to remain in touch.  No, no, no, no.  No, you would – providers are always in touch.  Once you have the providers are always in touch with me, that's fine.  And I always level set the timeframe so you don't have to call me every day.  You don't have to.  No, no.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  I will never call you every day.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I won't call you every day.  Okay.  No, no, it's okay.  You will have the process and I will follow you through the process.  That's not a problem.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  When you will not be responding to my email even after two weeks,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'll definitely be giving you a call.  Oh, I don't mind you calling me at all.  I don't mind you calling me.  I actually rather you call me than send me an email because I'm getting  –<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  My first attempt will be sending you an email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, we're just fine.  Yeah.  We're just fine.  No problem.  I have no problem with that.  That's fine.  I'm okay with that.  It's okay.  I just – you know, I want to just move forward on a positive note.  I can't fix what happened before.  I don't agree with what happened to you.  I empathize with you and I know it's very frustrating.  It's frustrating to us because we're the ones getting the complaint  and we have to do it up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  You are already –<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And it's just not fair for me to be treated a certain way.  Yeah.  But I'm not even the one responsible for these type of decisions.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Yeah, you're very clever.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You know how to handle –  But I'm pretty much – I'm going to send you the details right now.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me directly.  All right.  I am going to ask you – I'm not going to ask you now,  but at some point I am going to ask you if this complaint can be closed.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Sure.  That complaint can be closed when our doctor will be contracted within one week.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  But he won't be contracted within one week.  It takes time.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  How much time?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The NDA has to be count assigned.  So it has to be count assigned by our regional vice president,  which he signs off on multiple states.  So normally that can maybe take a week or two.  Those don't take that long to get signed.  I mean I've never seen it go past two weeks, to be honest.  Sometimes it gets signed by the way, you know.  And then once it comes to me, we have to discuss on the fee schedule  and I have to make sure that I'm giving you the correct fee schedule  and it has to be discussed because you're going to be considered a group, right?  So you're going to have to make a decision, right?  Are you going to have mid-level providers in this group?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  We have those providers, our medical providers.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, the ones you're telling me are MDs, I get that.  But eventually with time are you going to have medical – I mean mid-level providers?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  We have one nurse practitioner, family nurse practitioner,  so we don't want it to get her contracted with the Caroline.  She's already contracted through BCPS Anthem.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay, okay, okay, no problem.  For Anthem you will not receive the rates.  You will not get the rates.  You only get the rates after you've been contracted.  So there's nothing I can do.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  And Caroline only handles the behavioral health providers, right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, we only handle behavioral health providers.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Yeah, that's why we got that provider contracted through Anthem.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  What happened? I'm sorry. I lost you there.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  I just said that that's why we contacted Anthem for our other family nurse practitioner to get contracted.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And she's fine. She's contracted. She's currently seeing patients.  Oh, okay. Yeah, but not – okay, I got you. All right, no problem.  That's fine. That's okay. All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Have you sent that email to me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes, I'm sending it right now. I'll put – let me know when you get it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And I'm always very responsive, so you don't have to have –  Catherine, okay, here is the NDA for – we're just going to have the agreement NDA countryside.  Below are processes that will take moving forward.  NDA needs to be considered and approved.  Once approved, we will discuss the fee schedule for commercial and government-related lines of business.  If this will be processed by a EMB contract manager, agreed upon by email.  Once agreed, we will generate an agreement.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  And you said that it was an electronic agreement, but it is in the Word format.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We don't – we normally don't do that at all.  We want to stop ever online for a new provider.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  I have to – I have to take print off it, and then I have to sign it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You have to read the contract pretty much, sign it, and yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Yeah, this is what I'm going to do, and I will be – I will be –<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I can send the contract via doc.  If you can do that, if you can do that, please send me in a docu-sign.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's not a problem.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  That would make my life easier.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  However you want me to send it to you is fine.  I just can't send it to you more in the Word doc, because we're not going to accept any redlining.  Yeah, yeah, we won't.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  And how long ago you joined Caroline?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, I've been doing this for 20 – I've been doing contracting for 20 years.  Oh, my God.  Wow, wow, wow.  But I've been in Caroline – I've been in for BK, well, Caroline, formerly known as BK value option.  Yeah, yeah.  I've been in for eight years, like about eight years now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  And initially before eight years?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Huh?  What happened?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Before eight years?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Eight years I've been with Caroline, with – yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  And before that?  And before eight years?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And before that was – oh, before that was the emblem.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Emblem Health.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, I see.  Uh-huh.  I used to do medical contracting.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Yeah, yeah, I understand that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  But I love medical contracting.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Okay, so I just wanted to let you know, since we were told that in order to get the provider – in order to get these behavioral health providers with Emblem Health, we need to get the provider contracted for Caroline.  So we're for the Emblem Health and BCBS together, like for Caroline.  So once the provider gets contracted, they will be contracted for Emblem Health and Blue Cross, right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The group will get contracted.  Uh-huh.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  For Emblem Health, right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Uh-huh.  And you want all commercial and government lines, right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  So what lines of business will cover the Emblem Health part?  Okay, all.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  We try contracting with Emblem Health.  They don't usually provide or – yes, provides group agreements.  They only contract individual providers.  So that's why I was just asking.  Oh, yeah.  I work with them, so I know.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  I've also worked with them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That's why I know.  You know what you said?  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  And I only – and I don't only work with – I work with multiple insurance companies.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  So it's a little different because we're a vendor.  So we – how Emblem does their contracting and credentialing is not going to be the same as behavioral health.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  So you're a vendor for Anthem, right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  We're for Anthem.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  We have Anthem.  Well, we have Anthem Blue Coresuchu.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We have Emblem.  We have GHI.  We have IHA.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  We have Homosic.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We have BNF.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  We have all the map plans.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So all of the map plans we have.  I want to say we own – I want to say probably 80 percent of the market.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Interesting.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  So we have a lot of providers, a lot of plans, and a lot of providers.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  That is great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  So that contract will also include GHI, which is the city account, right?  So all your cops, teachers, and stuff like that, NYPDs, all under that account.  That contract would include GHI, NYSHIP, so the New York State account it would include.  It would include the non-HMO or the union – I mean we have some union employees as  well, union employers.  I think we have Home Depot too.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  We have several.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I mean a lot of people.  A lot of plans.  So it would include everything.  Yep.  On the contract itself, it's not going to be highlighted.  What would be highlighted on the contract itself is the disclaimers, like the disclosures  of emblems and the disclosure for empire.  But the other plans, they don't have disclosure forms, so they don't have disclosures, so  those would just fall under the – because they're government plans.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  So you will be covering empire plans as well, right?  Yes, I will be covering empire plans as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And now we've been on the phone for 49 minutes, so imagine me having to do this with a thousand  providers every day.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  But are – you know why we are on a long call?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Because there was a loss –  No, I don't mind.  I don't mind.  I'm patient.  You've been waiting for eight months, so –<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Not a month, a year.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  A year.  So don't worry for me.  I'm okay.  Listen, for me, once you have me, once you get my attention, you have my attention, I  don't care about anybody else.  Don't worry about that.  I just want you to realize and emphasize that this is what I have to go through and I have  to go through to every provider.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  I believe Caroline should – if they have that much contract of the market, then I believe  they need to hire more employees to lessen the backlog.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That's been suggested as well.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  So you're the only one working or do you have any associates working with you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, yeah, I have a whole team.  We have a team of 11, I think 11 of us contractors.  But we all work in different areas.  So I have New York City, I have Rockland, I have Orange.  Now, you have a new city.  Do you have any of your –  No.  Okay.  You're the only one handling this county.  I'm the only contractor for Rockland County.  I'm the only contractor for Rockland County.  I'm the only contractor for the New York City account, which is Manhattan.  And I'm the only contractor for Orange County.  And then you have a contractor for Westchester, Putnam, right?  And then you have a contractor for Dutchess, Staten Island, Long Island.  So different contracting managers are in specific areas.  So I've covered three counties.  I've covered one borough and two counties.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Got it.  Yeah, we have submitted for one of our other provider applications.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And he works in the state of Wisconsin.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  So yeah, let's see.  It's just been like three months, not three months, about three months since we submitted the application for that provider.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Wisconsin? What county is that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  He is Dr. Foktee County of Dane, D-A-N-E.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Dane County.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Dane.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So that's like all the way to the state.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  D as in David.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, yeah.  Dane County.  Yeah, I know what you're talking about.  That's all the way upstate, right?  Yeah, so that's a different contract manager.  Again, it wouldn't be the same thing.  Like, you know, getting to you is also frustrating to us as well, you know?  And it's not fun to have these conversations, you know, with the providers.  That's not really our fault, you know?  And I could just move forward with you.  I got it.  That's all I could do, Russell.  All I could do is move forward and give you what you need.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Have you prepared the electronic agreement yet?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm not.  I won't prepare anything until you sign that NDA.  Oh, okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  So I would just assume that you would be sending me the NDA form in electronic.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I did.  The nondisclosure agreement is – I already sent it to you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  That's in the word form, but I'm talking about the electronic version of the nondisclosure agreement, NDA.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  This is the NDA.  The nondisclosure agreement template that's attached, that's what you have to sign and send back to me.  Okay.  Okay.  I was just – okay.  I was just waiting for the electronic one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  You mentioned that you will be sending it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No, I'm going to send you the contract electronically.  But the NDA, I'm going to start to see your email.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  I'm going to enter our business name here.  Markuremd.com, I-N-C.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So once you send that back to me, I will send that to get countersigned and – who's the vendor?  Valley Cottage.  I'm in this city too.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Oh, this provider – you know where you get your write down the rules from my house.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It's in the syllabus.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Printed name.  It will be signed by me, Russell Reed, and my title is Senior Provider Enrollment, Anna.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  I need to put my signatures here.  Particular, you know, legal thing that I need to read that out?  Let me see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No, the sign and date.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  I've just sent back the signed NDA to you.  Oh, you sent it to me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Let me see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You got to put a date on Anna's sign.  You got to put a date on Anna's sign.  You got to put the date.  You got to sign it.  Oh, you signed it's sign, but you got to put the date on the sign.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  I was thinking that might be you who will put that date.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No, you put the date because you're the one going into this agreement.  I don't put the date.  No worries.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  I'm going to put it right now.  So day is 24th.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That's fine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  24th day of 4th April and 2024.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I believe that would be fine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  I've just sent another one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No problem.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  I'm here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Don't worry.  Yeah.  All right.  I'll create a folder for you and I'll get this to get signed.  Anything else that can help you with?  Yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  I'm here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Anything else I can help you with?  For now, nothing else.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm one for you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Please submit it for the counter sign.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'll send it.  You say you want anthems too, right?  We want Empire Plan.  We want Anthem Health.  We want anthems.  No, not a bomb.  I just want to create a new folder.  If you include MVP, then load the provider for MVP as well.  No, we do not do MVP.  We used to do MVP.  We no longer do MVP.  MVP doesn't do it themselves.  I have a friend that works at MVP.  If you handle Jimena, if you handle any other commercial.  Nope.  No Jimena, no.  No Aetna, no Cigna, no.  Nope.  Not yet.  No Fidelis Care, no.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  There's another insurance company.  Let me see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No.  No Cigna, no.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Okay, Medicare, Emblem Health, Empire Plan, Be Anthem.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  For these insurance companies.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Well, they're in Boston, so I think Health First is in Boston, so you may want to contract  with some.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Yes, you can do that for Health First.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I can't do that.  I don't work for Health First.  I don't.  We don't have Health First.  And while submitting the NDA form, please submit a request for EAP as well.  The EAP will come later because I have to get.  I want to see if I can do it for you, and then if I can do it for you, then I'll just  send it to you myself rather than transfer you to someone else.  And that would benefit you more.  You don't have to work with anybody else but me.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Oh, well, thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So just give me some second on that because I don't want to send you to someone else if  they give me the authorization to do it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Yes, that would be awesome.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You understand?  Yep.  Yeah.  So I'm going to give you the right now.  I believe it's like $75.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  You mentioned 90% you mentioned already.  It's like $75 EAP.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Just thinking for the other one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The other ones, I don't.  What do you mean the other ones?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Apart from EAP.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, the other ones would be me.  That would be me.  But the EAP, I'm not going to give you that right away because I have to get authorization.  What I want to do for the EAP, I want to ask permission that I can give you that contract  rather than sending you to someone else.  Because I'm not the contract manager for that.  I'm not the contract manager for EAP.  So instead of me transferring you to someone else, I will be the one doing the contract  for you, right?  But I don't want to step on anybody's toes.  I'd rather ask permission first, right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  This is called professionalism.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  I don't want to step on anybody.  Personally, I'd rather send it to you, but then I don't want to send it to you and not  ask for permission.  And then when I submit it, I get in trouble.  I don't want to do that, right?  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  You're sensitive enough.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So just put a pause on the EAP.  Let me get permission to send that to you.  If I have the clearance to send it, I will send it.  Everything would be sent via DocuSign.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Awesome.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Great.  Okay.  Yes.  So you mean like about two weeks for this NDA to get approved and count yourself?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  That is just a general timeframe.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  If it gets approved before the-  It's going to be way before that.  Yeah.  It's probably be-  Yeah.  I just got to keep on the safe side.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Don't afraid me.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  Don't afraid me.  So yeah, it will be- Hopefully it will be before two weeks.  Oh no.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm sure it's going to be before two weeks, but I have to be on the safe side because  you've been waiting for a long time and I don't want to give you an unexpected timeframe  that I can't meet.  I can't remember that time.  You know?  I can't remember that time.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Russell Reed</span></b>:  It was too much difficult for us.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I can imagine.  I'm so sorry you have to go through that.  I apologize.  Definitely.

So on both of the dates of services, UnitedHealthcare did not pay anything.  And the reason they did not pay was your annual deductibles were not met.  That's why they didn't pay and they had to transfer the balance to your responsibility.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So what are you showing me owing you guys?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jordan Moore</span></b>:  The total is 20764, $207.64.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And that's for the, there's no other bills or anything else on getting charged for those  for those 24 and 25?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jordan Moore</span></b>:  No, right now there is, these are the two dates of services where the balance is open  towards your responsibility.  However, there are two other dates of services where we have filed the claims to UnitedHealthcare  and these are almost 500 and some amount, which is still in process to the insurance<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  company to pay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jordan Moore</span></b>:  And I'm not sure if they paid or not, if you have not met your deductibles.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Are those for the 26 and 27?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jordan Moore</span></b>:  Yes, that's correct.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Now if I have a question, cause I'm getting billed another doctor's bill from the hospital,  one of the primary doctors there, not out of your office, I don't believe.  His name is Ray Ruda and on the 27th and 26th, they're saying it's not needed to be in the  hospital.  Like he stated, I didn't need to be in the hospital those two days, but I didn't get  discharged until the 28th.  Who would I talk to, how can I talk to VJ to see him to talk to this doctor to say,  you know, he came in and I'm dealing with the two different doctors and nobody told  me that I could leave earlier than they let me out.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jordan Moore</span></b>:  Okay.  The protocol for this would be once you receive the bill for these two dates of services,  obviously that would be from our side.  So just give us a call and whoever you speak with, just let them know that you spoke with<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  the doctor and doctor told you that you don't have to stay in the hospital for these two<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jordan Moore</span></b>:  dates of services.  That's why insurance is not paying for the claims.  So then at that time we will have to ask the matter to the doctor's office.  And then we can see...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So you guys will deal with the doctor to change the code?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jordan Moore</span></b>:  No, we'll have to contest the bill since you can tell them that it's not your mistake.  You were, you were in the hospital because of...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Not so much your bill.  Yeah, I'm not talking about so much your bill.  I haven't got your bill, said anything about your bill, but they declined Southern Hills  bill saying that is what the decline is.  But you, the doctor, were working together.  So if he, if I, when I'm trying to find a get ahold of him, of course, dealing with  the hospital and the hospital doctor is very hard.  Do you guys talk with the doc...  You guys see each other there all the time.  Do I tell you I'm having an issue with that doctor or what?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jordan Moore</span></b>:  I'm afraid actually we are a third party billing company.  And for that, you'll have to talk to the doctor's office directly.  And for that, just read all the number and press one.  Once you press one, you'll be routed to the doctor's office.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So you're just a billing company.  I'd have to deal with the actual office.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jordan Moore</span></b>:  Right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I could just pay, but right now the 207 has already been billed, charged and applied<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jordan Moore</span></b>:  to my deductible.  That is correct.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I could just pay you and they pay this bill for this invoice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jordan Moore</span></b>:  You can either pay, if you want to pay, you'll have to eventually talk to the doctor's office  because they take the payments or else you can just scan the QR code on the top right  side of the bill to pay it online.  So yes, whatever is easier for you, I can connect your call to the front desk if you  want to make a payment over the phone.

You need to go to TriWest.com under Provider Services.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ron Davis</span></b>:  TriWest.com. Just give me a second. Let me please. My system is a bit pookey, so I really beg your pardon.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Sure. No problem.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ron Davis</span></b>:  May I take a couple of more seconds? Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I understand. Mine does the same thing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ron Davis</span></b>:  And I do not hold my computer that I'm in a hurry because otherwise it actually gets slow. So that's why.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  TriWest.com. Okay.  Then you'll hit the Provider Services tab. It opens up a list.  TriWest.com.  TriWest.com.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ron Davis</span></b>:  Yeah. This is what I'm telling it to go.  Okay. I'm TriWest Health Care Alliance. And then need to go to Provider Services.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Alright. Go click Provider Services.  Okay.  Then you'll see the dropdown, Join Our Network.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ron Davis</span></b>:  TriWest Provider Network.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes. And then that'll open up and you'll go to Contract Request Form. Fill out the Contract Request Form.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ron Davis</span></b>:  Okay. So what if we have, do we have to be credentials first with you guys?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes. Before anything can happen, you have to fill out that form and you fill it out for the group.  And in the comment box, you're going to put every provider that you want credentialed under that group.  You need to put their name, their tax, their individual tax ID, and their individual MPI.  And list that all out in the comment section. Send that in. What happens with that is an application.  That application will go over to the Veterans Administration.  They will run an analysis and determine if we need providers in your area.  If they do, then, and make sure on that form that you have the good primary point, the contact.  The primary contact information is correct and the email is correct.  And make sure whoever is that primary contact checks the email address and they need to check the spam and the junk mail.  Because that's how they're going to communicate for contracting. It will be done by email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ron Davis</span></b>:  Do you know how long it will take for you guys to get it validated if you guys need a contract?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The whole contracting process takes about six months.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ron Davis</span></b>:  No, no. I'm saying once we submit this application, how long it will take?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It takes 30 to 90 days for the VA to process it.  We have no control over how long it takes the VA to process the analysis.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ron Davis</span></b>:  Oh my gosh. So you have to wait.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, you have to wait. The application goes in, it has to be analyzed, and then you'll get an email letting them know if they would like to credential you.  And then they'll tell you all about the credentialing process and what needs to be done.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ron Davis</span></b>:  Okay. That's a really great thing. Are you currently a military first? No.  Okay. And you fill that out and submit it after you add all the providers in there. Do you have any other questions or concerns?  Yeah, just one thing. So give me a second. It says are you currently or have you previously served military families?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Have you before been affiliated with the Veterans Administration or with TriWest Healthcare Alliance or with TriCare East or TriCare West?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ron Davis</span></b>:  That's what that means. Have you previously worked with any of those CCN programs?  No, no we don't. It should be no, right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You are correct. If you haven't did it, put no.  Okay, great. Your name is Vanessa? V like Valerie. V-A-L-E-R-I-E.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ron Davis</span></b>:  And Valerie, may I have your last name and issue of your last name? T like Tango.  T like Tango. Thanks, Valerie.  So Valerie, I know one thing more. I was speaking with the representative and they were telling me that the application should be sent, the initial credentialing application should be sent over to Blue Shield of California to get the provided credential.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That is we first have to apply. You have to first apply using the form for the VA to determine if they do want, if you qualify, then they will want the credentialing done.  And that's where Blue Cross Blue Shield comes in. They are a net sub that writes up the contract for us, between us.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ron Davis</span></b>:  Okay. If you guys give them a go ahead to get the provided credential or to accept a contract, you guys will send this over to Blue Shield of California and they will start writing the application.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All you have to do is send in the application. You have to wait for the VA to qualify or disqualify you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ron Davis</span></b>:  At that point, if you are qualified, they will tell you what the next steps will be.  And credentialing then will be done through Blue Cross Blue Shield of California or whomever it is, depending on the kind of services provided.  Let's see what this does. Oh, you're a big hospitalist group. Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That's something that they would have to tell us. They would have to let you know how to do.  But that's after you've been accepted by the VA. You don't worry about the credentialing anything yet, except for applying and waiting for the VA to say yes or no.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ron Davis</span></b>:  But we really take some time to just a simple yes or no.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That is correct, because they do a data analysis. They have to analyze the area where the facility is located.  They have to see how many specialists are already hospitalists in that area. How many hospitals need additional hospitalists.  There's all kinds of analysis they do. That's why. They make the determination based upon the need, the geographical area and the needs in those areas.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ron Davis</span></b>:  They have to let you know. My wife didn't take that much longer to say yes to me. So they should not take that much longer.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I can only tell you it takes 30 to 60 days. Sometimes 90 days. We have no control over that.  If you wish to complain, you'll need to call the Veterans Administration themselves. We don't control the Veterans Administration. We're a separate business.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ron Davis</span></b>:  No, I totally understand this. But I was just telling you that my wife didn't take that long when I actually proposed to her.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That's a good positive sign, huh?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ron Davis</span></b>:  That actually keeps me motivated to look forward, get the things done in a little quicker time.  So I hope that they guys actually will receive a determination from their side.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All I can say is the sooner you get it in, the more quickly they can get it processed.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ron Davis</span></b>:  Yeah, I just thought they did it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Did you put all 20? In the comment box, you have to have all 20 of those providers with their MPI, their individual MPI.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ron Davis</span></b>:  They have to have their individual MPIs and their individual tax IDs. Every person, every doctor has a state MPI.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And every doctor has a license or an individual TIN number. But if they're going to be all under the group, that's fine.  Do you have any other questions?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ron Davis</span></b>:  Yeah, I was saying once we submitted this, can we also follow up with you guys on the request which we submitted?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You need to wait at least 60 days, but you will get an email sent to that email address. That's the way they're going to communicate.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ron Davis</span></b>:  I hope. Thanks Valerie, I really appreciate you providing the 15th.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Sure, you're welcome Ron.

You didn't get any response on that email?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No, nothing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  I'm sure that the department... Because we have an SLA. We actually have to respond within the first three hours. I mean it probably took a little longer than that.  I actually can write to the manager of labs or the lead at labs with your contact information to get back to you, but they would actually be getting back to you by...  I mean it could be first thing tomorrow morning, but not today. And I'm sure that they might have worked on this.

Just to make sure that we address each and every point of yours.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Can you see my screen?  Yeah, I can see your screen.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Okay, perfect. Now, I'll start with the first email, which was with the subject, order of the diagnosis is incorrect.  We received a denial which stated that the diagnosis which was attached was not correct.  It was because previously the diagnosis we had was D50.0 specifically, but the denial was someone different than D50.  It was D51, I guess. So now we have added a rule to add the whole series of D50.0 and onwards.  Okay, with this case, even if you're adding another, you know, the category of the ICD, the claim would be billed accordingly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Okay. Now, another one was the medical records for account 8641.  For the account 8641, Dr. Abbasi, the denial reason is not covered under the protocols that were defined by you initially to do the resubmissions with the medical records.  Okay, the denial reason is something different than CO97, I guess. I'm not sure, just a minute.  But the claim was not billed, the medical records were not submitted because of the denial reason,  which was not included initially for the submissions of the medical records.  Remember, we discussed the denial codes with you.  You gave us the information and the resolution on which are the denial codes where you want us to do the, you know, the submission of the medical records.  So for this patient, Katie, Katie Pichotta, that was the reason of not submitting the medical records.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Are you talking about the MR number 8641? What are you talking about?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Yes, MR 8641.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Hold on one second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  So the date of service is 1-25.  Yeah, so the denial reason here is OA23, which does not fall under the category of submission of medical records.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  What date of service you said is that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  1-25. That's what you asked for.  Okay, and then, so let me see what denial was it for. Do they require medical records?  This is a payment and or address situation. N510, current in-account does not contain sufficient for this claim.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Actual payment will depend on the availability of the fund and determinations. That's nothing related to N510.  So what is the denial code for this?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  The denial code for this one is OA23 with the remark N9510. So OA is the other adjustments. They've made probably adjustment.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Yeah, no, this one also requires medical records because if you look at the OA, which is other adjustments,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  23 is the lack of prior pay identification, including payment and or adjustments.  Yeah, but it says that the consumer spending account does not, the payer or the plan or the consumer party does not have actual funds for now to pay for these services  because of the availability, inavailability actually of the funds or maybe the services were not eligible for this patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Yeah, they said the allowable is $18.27 and then they are $1.27. So this claim is a paid one and a patient responsible.  So the way that it has been posted is wrong.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  The patient's responsibility, check limits are...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Yeah, look at the annual, it's a limited fund, but what they're allowable is $18.27 and they moved it to the patient responsibility.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Well, Dr. Abbasi, we do not do, I mean, the patient's responsibility directly because in these cases, in most of the cases, insurance is making patient's responsibilities.  Unless and until it's related to the inactive coverage or out-of-network benefits, we do not transfer balances to the patients  and we keep it as an outstanding for that practice to make its own decision whether you want to continue transferring.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  No, but listen, sometimes the EOBs don't come right, but look at this. On the EOB, it obviously it says P27.  Yes, yes, Dr. Abbasi, you're right.  But when it was posted, it did not post it as that way. So, I mean, it's something that need, you know, this is like if you have a 0823,  then you have to go look at that EOB and, you know, transfer that 1827 and then adjust that right of whatever that is and then make it clear.  Because this is a posting issue. I don't know how we can resolve this. I don't know that is this a...  I already posted it and I already corrected it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  No, Dr. Abbasi, we leave it for the practice's consent, whether they want to do any resubmission, any appeals, any reconciliation against the allowed amount or the paid amount.  If we keep on transferring these balances to the patients, trust me, there are going to be many instances because we cannot do it specifically for this one claim.  You already know that there is no manual reading of the EOB attached here. It's the system who is posting these ERAs and EOBs, right?  So if we change that, the process, the functionality to transfer the balances to the patients in all such cases, there's going to be huge loss in the denials of the incorrect denials as well.  You know that insurance is always, most of the time, insurance is making incorrect denials, which is just like, you know, it is for your review to see whether you want to do the resubmission, whether you want to do the medical records update, or you actually want to transfer that balance to the patients.  So now I am going to... Let's see, you said you have already posted it and I'm going to refresh it and that's it. That's all you need to do.  So in the other cases of the resubmissions, it's just like one thing you had to transfer the balance to the patient and resolve it. ...claims that it's going to come as AO23. And AO23 is an issue with the insurance not moving it to patient responsibility.  Not just the OA, which is a denial code, but the remark code also matters because the remark code here is different.  It's stating consumer spending account does not contain sufficient funds. So, you know, it's the patient's responsibility to pay for the outstanding balance.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So let's move on because there is a lot of things to do.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Yeah. So the next patient was Julie Loytas. Medical claim need to be submitted, but only denied CPT needs to be billed. Extra units billed, only four.  So here you have asked what happened on this patient. You have tried to send the corrected claim for account Julie Loytas for data service 12-5-23.  You were unable to do it. You were unable to do it because I think there is a mismatch in the patient's CPT charges.  So when we are doing the resubmission, Dr. Abbasi, for Medicare, first of all, you have to send an original claim, right?  You cannot send a corrected claim or replacement claim.  And the second thing is that you will have to only resubmit the denied CPT. The rest of the CPTs needs to be marked inactive, the paid ones.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Let's go. Can you see my screen? Julie Loytas, 864. What data services is that on, Julie Loytas?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  864.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I am. You don't want to go look into it either.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  I'm going to look for it. Julie Loytas, 4319. Okay. So that data service is 12-3, I guess. 12-5.  12-5. There it is, Medicare. So Medicare has denied it.  So now all you have to do is resubmit, resubmit the claim by marking the other CPTs inactive.  Okay. So here the insurance has actually denied 96367 only.  Yeah, 96367. So if we need to do the resubmissions on this one, because already we have been paid $187, insurance transfer 46 to the patient, but they denied the CPT 96367.  Now, if I go onto the charge, yeah, Medicare 96367. It was previously billed as five units. I have changed it to four units.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I changed it, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Oh, you changed it. Yeah, that's one point because it was denied probably because of the five units.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Hold on one second. Let me see if it's correct. Hold on, Jonathan. Go back. What are you doing? Don't change anything. Give me one second. Let me have a little glass of it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Not changing anything.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay. So we 3415, J1000. So that should be the right amount. Okay, good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  The rest of the CPTs should be marked inactive and you can bill it with 96367 and bill it an original claim to Medicare.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So before I did not have to do that. I do not have to go and make everything inactive. I would just go make the correction and then send it.  And I have been doing that for 9999.99%  This is the only claim that is not going through without doing it inactive. And I'm not going to go make all of them inactive to be able to send this one because it is a lot of work and Medicare has never given me any trouble on sending them without making the others inactive.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Can you try it again? Now can you do it by changing the units for because there has been change now. Now you should be able to bill it.  Can you see if you can send a corrected claim now? Previously we asked for your email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I can't do it on my screen because I don't have the control on your screen. But I can do it on my side.  So this is the set of 12.5. Give me one second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Account number is 43.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So for 12.5, for all of them I was able. But now not for that one. But let me see right now if it has any changes or not.  So the 96.0, the professional. Yeah, I can send it now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Perfect then.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  But there was something wrong there because I wasn't able before. But I never change anything to inactive. I send them all.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Yeah, you're right. You're right. It is because we need to make some certain changes to the chart if we are doing the resubmission.  Maybe the data service was. Yeah, maybe you didn't change the units previously. Now it's changed so you'd be able to do it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Now moving on to the next point. Oscar claims.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Okay. You have provided us the link and the portal access. All right. So we and we will send it over to you unless and until the ERA is established for this pair.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay.  But you're posting them. You're putting it in the system. Is that right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  We will not be able to do it. No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  You're not being able to post those EOBs for the Oscars?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  No. No. That is minimal stuff, Dr. Abbasi.  We can provide you with the EOBs, but we can also initiate the ERA.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I am providing you with these EOBs because I actually give the user a password and I gave you all those EOBs.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Yeah, but we do not do the mental force things.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Don't tell me you're giving the EOBs. I'm giving you the EOBs. What's the point of the EOB when it's not posted that we don't know what the status of everything is?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  No. We can only do the EF ERA system. What we did last time was that whenever I give these accesses, you guys were able to do it through the interfaces, pull all the ERA's and post them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  And I did that. I joined you that we had them with other insurances and you pulled them in and then you posted them.  So we're not going to be able to do one by one of these postings.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Dr. Abbasi, as I said, we will initiate the setup. We will initiate the ERA's for it, as I said, already said it.  We're going to initiate the ERA's so that the insurance starts sending the ERA's for the future appointments.  I'm not certain if insurance will send us the ERA's for the previously paid claims against which that has already been generated.  Now, I have already forwarded to my enrollment team and they're going to initiate it. They've already initiated it. I'm just waiting for the confirmation.  If it's accessed, then you will be able to pull them electronically to submit them, to post them electronically.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  That's what you did with the other insurances. Why you are not extracting them and posting them electronically?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  We would be posting the ERA's, Dr. Abbasi, not the EOBs that land in a PDF format, not in the system, but separately in our desktops.  Yes, you post the ERA's from there. Of course, the ERA's, whatever. The EOBs, I don't need the ERA's. Listen, you're going to help me to have an EOB PDF.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I want the ERA to be posted.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Yes, Dr. Abbasi, that's what I'm saying. Once the ERA has been set up, once the ERA is established, it's just like a regular posting for us.  But until then, for the claims where the EOBs are already generated, I would just request you to take care of those EOBs.  Once the ERA setup is established, enrollments are completed. You won't have to do the postings of the EOBs.  At least the system will be posting the ERA's, just like for the other insurances.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Hold on one second. Let me transfer that point.  Can you pick up that line and reschedule that patient for me, please? Thank you.  Okay, go ahead and...  Let's go to the next...  When is the time for the OSCQR? I need the time. I need to know when are you going to have this ERA.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Dr. Abbasi, we have initiated it. Let me follow with my team if they have an EDT from the insurance.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  If they have it, I'll let you know in the response to this email.  Okay, so for the OSCQRs, you're not able to post for now.  We're going to have to go ahead and post all of the EOBs. Unbelievable.  Are you saying that all along for these past few years, we have not had the EOB from the OSCQR?  Let me double check something. Hold on.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  No, it might be an issue after the change healthcare.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  What?  Yes, we have received before. So all of a sudden, you lost it and now you have it?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Dr. Abbasi, a lot has been changed after the cyber attacks on change healthcare.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Yeah, but it was a small job. You were talking about there was no ERA initiated. That's different from there is an ERA,  but we just need to see what the problem is and resolve it, because in that case, I would have to go and post one by one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Because I'm also seeing the ERAs being landed in QMd as well, right?  I can see data services from 2024, which means that's the only recent one data service that I can see,  which is already posted by my team and that happened on February the 19th.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay. So then the problem is that whatever your connection went off, you need to reconnect it,  and then all of those EOBs should be able to come in.  So what I'm trying to tell you is that I'm alarming you, there is a problem from your OSCQR one.  Go fix it and get the rest of the EOBs. I'm not going to post it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Dr. Abbasi, let me explain that to you. We are fixing the problem, right?  During that time of the change healthcare, we initiated that thing that there is going to be a problem.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  There is going to be a problem.  There is a problem happened, okay? But what I'm trying to tell you is that go and ask them,  and maybe you can pull and post the ERAs and it should not be a problem.  Don't come tell me and say it would be a problem, we're working on it, but you did not work on it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  You haven't even called them and you haven't initiated anything.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Go fix it, go see the ERAs coming, and then come back to me and say, listen, Dr. Abbasi,  we cannot, it's going to take longer, we need your help.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  No, Dr. Abbasi, I initially, I'm sorry to cut you off, initially when this change healthcare issue committed,  we informed you that this is because we are trying our level best to make sure that we set up ourselves  with all the plans, with all the plans which require a setup through a different vendor,  which require an EFT or ERA setup, so we are going to do that.  But there is going to be a downtime in that case where the insurances will be sending the EOBs to the office,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  or you can download the EOBs from the system to assist us.  In the meanwhile, while we are doing trying to set up our ERAs, the only problem here,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  the only problem here, the only problem here, we do not do the minimal follow-ups from the insurances,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  asking about whether that certain claim is paid or not.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  When you send us this link, this email to us that you have received some EOBs,  or you have some EOBs which are not in QMd,  I have told you that we are going to go into the OSCARS web portals,  we are going to see if there is any hurdle with the ERAs,  if there is any hurdles which restricted the system or which restricted OSCARS to send ERA directly into QMd,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  and if it gets fixed over the portal, we can do that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  But if insurance says that that downtime, that specific time where we generated the EOBs,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  and that has been done, there is process as it is, but moving on,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  after reinitiating the ERA setup, we will start sending the ERAs again to you.  I'm only asking you to take care of those specific only few time of the EOBs by yourself,  in a meanwhile, we have it set up everything according to it was in the past.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, let me tell you this, I listen to you, now you listen to me.  My concern is that you never went to the OSCARS ERA and see what the hurdle or the problem is to fix it.  My problem is that you are wanting me to do the work without you fixing the situation.  I'm not posting anything, I'll go view them, and I want you to go fix the problem,  because my belief is that after you fix the problem, we don't have to do manual posting,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  all of the EOBs are going to pull over again.  Okay, again, if it's still OSCARS says that we do not have electronic ERAs that would be linked with your system,  we will have again a problem with those EOBs, Dr. Prabhasi, and that problem is again, no manual posting.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  You never know, we never know till you fix that OSCARS ERA.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  That's fine, if you don't want to post those EOBs, if you want to keep that balance open to the plan, that's fine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  That's fine, unless and until I give you an answer, I don't have any problem.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  It's the to-do list, okay?  It's already forwarded to my team.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Yeah, to-do list, and then I'm having here, and I'm going to, you know, we're going to be looking at this every week, okay?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  So next week, we're going to go through the to-do list for you for the next week one, okay?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, so you're going to ask for ERA, and you're going to let me know that it's transferable or not, is it fixed or not, okay?  So we have that one as one of the issues.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Next one is an email from your new hire, Jenna.  She has sent us again some missing EOBs for Mutual of Omaha.  She said she cannot find any claims, she cannot find any EOBs at the portal as well,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  and she has given me dates of services very old, I mean older than you joining the ABS, okay?  So there is one account, 8541, who has data services from 2024.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  I've already informed my team to get back to the insurance and get the status of these two claims, okay?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  And see whether, you know, we, how we missed anything or not.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  So if we have missed anything, we're going to download it, we're going to have it posted somehow,  but for the date of services from March 23, May 23, we're not sure what needs to be done on those.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, so the issue was that did it ever go to the patient, to the, which are my,  our question was that we are not seeing the EOB at the Mutual of Omaha website.  Does that mean it never left the CureMD and gets to the Mutual of Omaha or not?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Well, as I said, I have asked my team to check for the account 8541, okay?  For the date of services, January 2024 and February 2024.  So if they haven't been billed or whatever has happened, as was it billed or not,  if it was not billed, we'll check if we need to resubmit or not.  And if it was billed and there was no payment received, then why it was not received.  Whether there was an EOB generated, which was missed or never landed in CureMD or whatever happened.  So whatever is there for the date of service, January and February 2024, I'll give you an update on it.  That's against the email Jana has sent.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So what date of services was that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Jana has mentioned the date of service 14 2024, which Medicaid has paid primary  and Mutual of Omaha hasn't paid anything for, you know, against $50.  Yeah, so we'll check if you're receiving, you know, what's the status of the payments coming from the Mutual of Omaha.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, okay. So that one is still in question.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  So that is the day for the patient, 8641, we send EO4 January, February 2024.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Okay. Next one is from your email address directly from your personal email asking about record sending  and you have attached a couple of insurance letters.  So just wanted to let you know that we already received the ERAs against these letters, right, against these appointments.  But those letters were, those ERAs were received on April 22, 2024.  And the submissions of the medical records has already been done.  It's just these letters were sent over on April 16.  You received these letters before the ERAs received afterwards in CureMD, but this has been taken care of.  The submission of medical records has already been done.  So you're saying that, the question I had is that we get a letter that says your medical records are insufficient  and then we go there and nothing's sent and then, so how did they got anything that there is nothing in it that you are now sending?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So my question is that how did they say, oh, thank you for your query, we did not receive medical records.  So did you send a blank thing to them?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Well, as per the protocols, we are not doing, Dr. Abasi, we have discussed that we are not doing submissions along with the medical records, the first submissions, right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Yes, that's right.  Yes.  So there was no submission with the first claim that you sent.  Yes.  But after we get an unpaid claim, then you send them each of them.  But now we received a letter that looks like you have sent a record, but it was a blank one with no record.  Well, we sent the records on after, I'm not sure what's the reason here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  It says, didn't include, first one is it is allowed as separate charge because the medical records submitted didn't include an evaluation and management note.  So it's, again, it's just like a description of missing medical records.  Next one is for the blood count.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Well, why would it be like a missing medical record?  Because you never appealed it or you never disputed it.  So how did they get a response that like you send an appeal with no record?  You know what I'm saying?  I'm getting a letter that says you send an appeal but you didn't attach your record.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Yeah, exactly. That's the whole point because there are some other CPTs like blood count as well where they're asking for the laboratories.  For this specific one, 85025, I have checked with my, you know,  wanted to confirm whether we need to extract this record from your, I don't know, like a pharmacy or where?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  No, no, listen, you only have to send the medical, the provider note.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  The provider note.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  The provider note and the chemo note, both of them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay. So my concern is that when I go to any of these patients, I do not see that you all just extended using medical records just like yesterday.  And then I get this letter that was sent like last week or so that I just got the mail that said you didn't attach medical records.  So is there a delay between the time you did this and then send the, you know, thing?  Is this because of the glitch that you had?  Because I'm not supposed to receive a letter saying you didn't send submitted medical records.  It should say you submitted medical records, you reduced the record and it doesn't have, you know, supported or whatever.  So when I get like these 50 emails, I mean, emails or 40, 50 emails a week saying that, listen, you did not submit medical records,  then kind of like, okay, are they sending, are they appealing without sending the medical records?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Well, Dr. Abbasi, as I said, we can only do the submissions once we receive an ERE.  If you're looking at my screen, you will see that there is an EOB posted on April 22nd, 2024.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Before that, we have absolutely no idea whether they want the medical records or not, right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, so let's go to the ones that I already sent you the email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  I'm looking at the same one.  I'm looking at the same one.  That's what's in hand.  That's this patient.  The letter that you received has a date of April 17th, 2024.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  So April 17th.  17, 2024.  I'll send you, I'll show you a screenshot.  Can you see it?  Can you see this?  April 17th, 2024?  Oh, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Now we-  That is strange because we didn't post it until April 22nd.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  So unless and until there is an ERA, which is supposed to be processed by my system,  right, we're not sure what is required there.  And now if they're sending a letter to the practice-<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Maybe the problem was I don't know what was the problem.  But it was very strange.  I thought that maybe you guys, even if I didn't send medical record, I don't know.  But right now you're telling me that you do not send any medical record until you receive<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  your ERA.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Yeah.  But then there's a delay for you to receive the ERA anyway.  I don't know what's happening.  Honestly, I don't know.  I don't know how would that even mail be created when you haven't sent anything?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Well, I don't know.  It's just like maybe they're just sending out the letter stating missing because it's<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  not actually an EUB, right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  It's what they call insurance letters.  Maybe they're sending out listed and claimed information.  Partially delaying it.  This means that no benefits are payable for the giant services.  Again, unless and until there's no ERA, we cannot take any actions against it.  If it's been sent over, I mean, I don't know.  We can't do anything about it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  And this is for all the patients.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  That's for all the patients as well.  The insurance letter CureMD goes out after the ERA and CureMD has been posted.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Any letter sent for is not anything CureMD did.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Next issue is which came from your email again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Rejected due to invalid decimal precision.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  I'm with you.  Go ahead.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  I'm saying that there were a few rejections which you reported that the description is<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  rejected due to invalid decimal precision.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  I have reported it to my team.  We're not sure.  We're not certain what this denial rejection reason is.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  So, we're not sure what this denial reason is.  My team has been informed to look into.  Once we have a better, brief explanation, I'll let you know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Hello?  Yes.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  I'm with you.  Go ahead.  Okay.  And I'm with you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  We're not certain what this denial rejection reason is, why they're doing it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Dennis, can you hold one second?  Dennis, can you hold one second?  Let me answer this one.  Give me one second.  Yes.  About your appointment for tomorrow morning.  Yes.  This is the – yeah.  About your appointment for tomorrow morning.  Yes.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  I can move it tomorrow at around – let's see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I think I have something – change it to at around 245.  245? Yeah, almost three, it's 245. Yes, thank you. Have a good day. Bye bye. I'm sorry,  Dennis. Okay, so those are just, you know, problems. Okay, so I don't know that. So what  is going to happen because they have been sitting there in the rejection area. Now let's go, I'm<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  going to the rejection area. Yes, I have informed my team and they're going to look into it. What<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  seems to be the problem. We're not certain as well that why they're, what actual reason is. Once we  have a clear understanding or an explanation why they are denied due to decimal precision,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  I'll let you know. And that's all, but they have been there now since when? What was the patient's<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  name? The decimal one. I will have to look into that just a minute. Because you know what, I mean,  if it's a rejection area, you guys have to look at it too because it's not my job to go to find  the rejection area that is kind of a CureMD problem. So give me a rejection. You have to give me a  rejection that I can't clear. If it's a rejection, it's a decimal one and you have been sitting on it  since April the 9th and then your team is still working on it and you're April 24th, that doesn't  make sense. Dr. Abbasi, these are, I mean, because we already are putting a lot of manual efforts for<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  which definitely falls under, and not under, but over the scope of the autonomous billing<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  project. We're not going into the rejected bucket, we are only reporting you the rejected claims that  are in the rejected bucket. If there is one which you cannot resolve, you let us know just like you  did it here and I can see if there is something problem with me, my team, is this something with  my system or not, whether is there anything that I can do for you, we'll definitely regularly on the  rejected claim like a manual stuff, this won't be possible. Reporting to me is not a dealing help.  Okay, if you are, the rejection has to be, anything you send to me as a report that you send  me has to do with something that I have to go and fix. I'm not going to come and resolve all of your,  you know, tell you you have problems, there are problems, okay, but in the rejection area,  all of it is cure MD problem. Again, no, you need to look at your rejection, that is not an,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  absolutely not. No, Dr. Pasi, you're saying that the rejection part is cure MD's problem where it  says subscriber, subscriber information is missing or invalid, do you think it's cure MD's problem?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Subscription is invalid, which one? Give me like, listen, out of the bottle. Susan Farrell,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Susan Farrell, I have shared my screen with you. The patient was seen by Dr. Tarvishi,  Susan Farrell, it says subscribers information is either missing or invalid, which means that  the primary insurance, which means the insurance that was added in the patient's demographics is<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  incorrect. If you want to put your rules, I can do this, I mean, I think it might be more reasonable.  When your people go to the rejection area, if they feel rejected due to invalid dissimilar<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  precision, they need to go fix it. It's not my problem, okay? And if they go, like, what was the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  ones that I told you? I sent you everything about the rejection area. Like, one of them was Mrs.  Taylor Polk, okay? Saying that that code is not valid, but that code is valid. So again, when you  see J9075 is not valid, your team has to go on it and just say, oh, is this valid or not? Our system  is saying, oh, maybe it's not a problem. So I, anything that is in here, okay, it's not, I'm not  going to be able to resolve the dissimilar precision. I'm not able to resolve the J9075.  So you resolve the issue in the rejection that is before, just like the way I go to the clean claim.  I go to the clean claim, you resolve your issues, I resolve the part I do. Rejection. I'm not going  to resolve your issues or bring it to your attention. Dr. Bossey, this is, I'm sorry,  this is the whole purpose of you acquiring the autonomous billing in which ASPR or SOW,  which indicates that we take care of the autonomous billing part and assist you with anything that we  can do. Now, what you're asking us is us to review each and every day, manually going into the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  rejection bucket and see what we can do, what you can do. I think here, I think here, without any<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  further commitment to you, that what we can do for you and what not, I think we will have to review  again our SOW with, you know, whatever the responsibility, we need to define it again,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  because it's definitely going to cause a problem for you as well as for us, because we cannot  commit anything, and I cannot commit anything that does not fall under the SOW that we have committed<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  with the ABS contract. If you really want, and I'm trying to help your system too, you want this  system to work and become as much autonomous as possible, okay, to do. And this is one of the  things you're going to learn that is in the rejection area, okay, because this should align  your autonomous system. If you get a rejection that says the dissimilar points are a problem,  you immediately have a plan for it. If you see a rejection that says a J code is not valid,  you should create an autonomous system that would give an immediate response to it. So, if you want  to learn from this, or do you want to resist with me, okay, because we are both trying to make this<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  as autonomous by creating good rules into it. So, we have already designed, I do understand,  have designed, we have already modified the rules where the system is capable of making the changes  in a certain area of the system. It's not something that the system goes into each and every<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  domain of the practice of the database and make the changes automatically. What you're asking  here is not the update in there. You want it to be updated or, you know, to be changed into  autonomous billing actions, but this is not what we are offering here on the Rejection Bucket.  Just quoting you an example. This is something that my team has to go through on an average<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  hours of manual efforts. If it was possible for us, if it was possible for us to do it or take  care of it automatically by my system, we would have informed you that. We would have asked you  to allow us to make certain changes in the submissions. Now, what we can do, just like<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  you recorded it, there's something with the decimal precision or there's a code coming in as<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  subscriber, subscriber member ID is missing or invalid. Now, my autonomous billing already lets<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  the user front desk or the provider knows at the time of checking in that there is an ineligibility  with the patient. That's what my system can do. Now, if that was bypassed, if the insurance<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  information was not corrected, if it has ended up in a rejected bucket because at the first point,  at the first part, the subscribers information was not corrected. Now, there is no reason or<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  there's no option for my system to somehow take care of it automatically, to somehow develop  itself or through an RPA to take or to cater to such kind of rejections, which is why...  It's okay if you don't want to learn from it, you don't want to consider it, that's why. But I'm  going to tell you that the response of all of this, when you send me a list of my rejection,  when you send me that rejection list, I know that this rejection, I can automatically tell you that  a lot of it is your problem, 90% of it is your problem. So like those doing, but I send that  email to you and you said you have a response for me. You still don't have a response about  the decimal one. Do you have a response about the J9070 because that's a big money sitting there.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  What is the response for that? No, no, no. Dr. Bazi, I said I have a response for you,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  does not mean that I have a resolution for you. The response is that it was reported yesterday<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  and my team has to work on it or at least give us 24 hours of time so that my team can work and see<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  if there is anything that we can do and come up with a solution. I have a response that this has<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  been received and has been forwarded to the concern team to look upon it. I am not giving<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  you a resolution on these specific. Out of the rejection area, do you have any resolution at all<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  of all the rejection area? Now one where it says procedure code detail description is missing or  invalid. I went to the patient and saw there were two procedures, similar one with the different<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  descriptions. Now I want to know is there any change in the description you made? Can you tell  me which patient that is? I'm talking about Taylor, right? If I go into discharge, if you're<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  seeing my screen, you can see my screen, you can see my screen. Okay, I go into the claim.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  There's a claim. The patient's name is Taylor. Yeah, now you see there are, let me see,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  we have here Taylor, Syclo, this one. So it is rejected because this description is incorrect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  This description is incorrect? That's what the rejection reason is. I'll go with it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Just procedure code detail description is missing or invalid. Now I'll tell you something.  You're still looking at my screen? Yeah, yes. All right. Let me go to the,  all right, it's loading just a minute. Okay, there we are. Claim information.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  All right. J9075, J9075. So one J9075 says Syclo PHO5 disperse 1100 mg,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  wastage 400 mg. Now same code coming up with a different description. I just wanted to confirm  if this has been changed or been modified by you because this is not what we have, systems CPT<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  description. So there's no way system is populating this part here. I just wanted to  confirm whether you made any changes into the, you know, the description of the procedure.  But the description is correct. The Syclo PHO5 is 1500, 1100 was used and 400 was wasted. What are<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  you talking about? The description is wrong. Why? I'm not talking about it. Insurance denying is<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  stating the description is invalid because if we are trying to show the wastage, we have these  modifiers JW and JZ, which would reflect. And you have to say JW is there. The JW is there.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Yeah. That means that this specific description might have not been required because, you know,  one code J9075 is coming with a different description. Same code is coming up with a<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  different description. So definitely we're going to have. This always happens. This always happens.  Oh my God. The J9075 or any kind of medication, whenever you say, okay, I use this much and I  wasted this much. And then you go to the other one and then do the same thing. And you just say,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  it was wasted for that. So the Syclo PHO5, which is the J9075. And then by the way, let me see.  So let me go back to, because I can't see your screen. Let's go to Mrs. Constance Taylor. And<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  it says over here, data description or missing or invalid. So let me, let me look at the thing.  It's J9075. I want to look at it. And your mycin. And this is the 1000 milligrams. So everything  looks okay into this one. Also the thing is that with your, and the other thing is that with your,  what your problem in this one is too. Your claims are going without a JZ on some of the drugs.  And one of them is for date of service of 4-22. You're missing a JZ for the 9,000 here. And let<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  me go to the back to the other one. And the same patient Constance Taylor for the date of service  of the 4-1. And on the description, let me see the J90. The very first J9075, your missing claim  is probably not going. It's not because of the description. The code is in the J9075. And I sent<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  you an email. Most people of the EOBs are going without the JZ on the claims. Right now, I think  this is the problem. And I'm going to go for the JZ. Are we talking about the date of service 4-22?  Both of them. The one of them is missing the JZ for the J90. And I don't know. Let me go there.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Give me because I don't have it doesn't seem to be. I can see one of them here is and the other one  is not. But the rejection is for the same reason asking about the inveller. Hold on one second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So yeah. Okay. So let's go ahead. Let me go ahead and change that to the JZ. And let me see if it's  going to go. I didn't get JZ to the J9075. Yeah, I'm going to save it for one. And then I'm going  to go to 4-22. And I'm going to go add a JZ for the J90. And then I'm going to go to Mr.  what's his name? Polk. Let me see if you all have the same issue with that or not. Yeah,  you again JZ is Miss 5. So I'm going to send those to corrected ones. Mr. Polk.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  This is so you see it's your issues. And that's that's one thing. Let's go now back to the other<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  issue we had under the rejected area. What was it was Mr. Black and Mr. two of them Mr. Black and<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Mrs. Max Marlin. The other one was Dr. Deveeshi which were which we already discussed this was<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  because of the patient subscriber ID. Hold on. We'll get to that one. I'm going to see what the  problems that I have and that is your issues first. Okay, I want to resolve those. So this  one it says the one for the Mr. Black one. What did I write for you? I said what it was for decimal  we I'll get back to you with that. I said decimal issue. Okay, so how we resolve the decimal issue.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  This is your problem. I'll get back to you. Yeah, I'll have to see if it's our problem or not.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Then the other one was a community health choice all those four of them the community health choice.  Okay. Yeah, the problem is that what is the problem in the community health choice because  it seems that all the insurances this community health choice are having a problem. What is the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  issue? Well, the issue again here they're stating about the patient's member ID. Maybe they have a  different format of the ID. We're not sure unless we get from the insurance. There are four of them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  There is two is Susan Farrell and the third one is Russell the better and the fourth one is 470. So  this is not a patient's ID issue. This is again your system about the insurance because it looks  something is missing in there and I cannot understand it or fix it. So there is nothing in<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  this rejection area. That is our issue. The other one is Arabzadeh. The claim is sitting over there<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  and let me see this one. What about this one about Arabzadeh? It says he is missing. Yeah,  the JZ is missing on the J9196 and the JZ is also missing on J1200. JZ is missing on J9.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  These are missing. Hear me? I'm here. I'm looking into that. Yeah. The JZ is missing for like three<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  different. J9196 didn't have it. The J9060 didn't have it and also there was one more. I think it  was a J1200 or 1100. Oh yeah. So I am saving this. I added the JZ. I'm going to mark that as corrected  one too. I'm going to look into the community health choice one and you're going to look at the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  dissimulant one, whatever that number is because I need that ASAT resolved. I cannot be waiting on  these 801,000 claims and not having them resolved. The other issue is the DME under Frederick Brown.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Let's see what that is. Missing or invalid. Okay. Yeah. I already corrected that and I put RRKJKX.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  So the update on DME is that we were able to get the claims paid. I have an example<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  of the patient Brian McCarty. This one that is rejected. For the Frederick Brown for the date  of service of 10-18. Something about the frequency is missing and what does that mean because I<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  already put all the modifier right here. Yeah. So we got the payment from the insurance on April 18th  so my team has confirmed the protocols that we have set up mentioning the correct use of  modifiers which includes RRKJKX. We would be submitting the other claims, the other denied  claims as per the insurance requirements. I'm sure it's going to cover up for the one that which is<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  rejected as well. It already has the RRJKKX but it's not going and it says as a claim frequency.  Where is the frequency located? Let me see. Do you know what's frequency here?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Maybe it's again it's because of the timeline of the billing. All these codes. Oh no it has<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  nothing to do with that. I don't understand it. And the other one was Maryland Dawson. This is  from 2021 so we can remove that one. And at the end there was M. Parati insurance Thomas Amato.  And then it says that this payer is unable to accept electronic because this one has to go by<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  paper. That one needs to be billed on a paper. Or what is this plan? P. Marpi? Yeah. Thinner on paper.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay. Everything on the rejection area and needs to be addressed from the community health choice<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  and from all those reticulate injections from the Black and Max Farlin. Please address those<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  and then I'm going to put over here the rejection. We will review and refer back to you on all the  CureMD issue. Currently is all CureMD. And so we have this one. So now let's go to the next issue.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  This one claims for J9190. So that has been reported to the team to see if  the the modifiers were populated from the module or not. We still have to wait for the confirmation.  And there was one concern mentioning why this situation – Can you go back to the screen of<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  the problems? And I don't know which J9190 are you talking about. Okay. So that was for<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  this one here. Claim denials. Oh, okay. Hold on. First of all, what about the Nancy Winkler? What  happened to that reticulate one? Yeah. That one only specific one was some – only one out of  many. There are certain instances where we have to rectify by about the modifiers and everything.  And there was some manual intervention which caused the incorrect submission of the units,  which now definitely has been reported. And we have come up with a mechanism to make sure  there are no errors involved. We have taken some measures as well. So it's not probably  going to happen. But this was just out of those 100 was one instance where the units  had to be added manually. And it was skipped. It was copy-pasted. But the number of units  were not correctly reflected the way it was supposed to be because of the manual intervention.  So we have already taken the measures. We have rectified. There are no previous instances.  What manual thing happened? And how can I make sure nothing like this has happened?  We can get into you, Dr. Abbasi, that we have now taken the measures or we have enhanced our QA  processes to make sure that everything which is going on out of QMd is perfectly. We already have  established our checks and rules to make sure the billing is done correctly. As I said, it's one of  those very one instances because of some manual entries. It was skipped. But it's not going to  happen again. We have made sure there is nothing done previously incorrectly like that. And we are  very certain it's not going to happen in the future. It's reported by you. But we will make  sure it does not go back to you. And if there is anything that was supposed to be done or corrected,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  we do it real time. My question is that I know you're promising it would not happen. You're<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  nothing right anywhere that I should be worried about. Yeah, we have already rectified the data.  Our QA team will make sure that nothing has been skipped because in such cases, it's not just we  skipped the one problem that was faced, but our QA team have some certain checks and make sure they  run some data from the past to make sure it was not happened in the past. And we restrict it to  happen in the future. Okay. And then for the rest of the talk, Dr. Abbasi, I really request  to get back to you. What is this one? It says ERA is received on 4-22 and the record has been?  That's what we already discussed, Dr. Abbasi, about the insurance letters that were coming  to you. These are my own words that I was trying to explain, but we have a few points,  Dr. Abbasi, left. I would really request if we can do it by tomorrow or anytime,  cover it next week. Otherwise, I'll reply you back on an email. I have to find it, follow,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  and then make sure it's going to happen. Okay. So we put a lot, and then it's not just like one or  two problems. This is a lot of problems happening. But can you tell me why Chelsea is making,  you guys are still making Chelsea claims? That was one other issue that is important. And why  is patients twice worth of COVID? The one point that you said about the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  Kelsey that was, we already, as I said, we have already made the changes to it. We're not adding  any new Kelsey to the patient. That one specific patient that you mentioned was an old date of<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  service from 2023, which is why it caused a problem. So not the earliest date of 2024,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  I guess. No, it's not. Robbie said the patient does not have Chelsea or created Chelsea?  Yes. Yes. The one that Robbie sent me, it was an old instance, but there are no more<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  adding of the Kelsey. Can you give me the name of the patient that Robbie sent you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dennis Wood</span></b>:  The count number 7916. 7916?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Yeah. It was one of those claims that you sent me that this patient has not, and you know,  if I go to the log and yeah, you guys, yeah. We edited it.  So you corrected it today, is that right? Yeah.  420, 322, but the billing was sent to them and not to the right one.  Okay. And all right. So this one, the 1324 was sent to who? Was it Chelsea? So  redirected the claim to go to the right one. But it still looks, I'm seeing her",8327987875,,,,"frank.alven, fred.allen, gary.gatland, imran.hussain",Client Facing,QA Analyst,563

I mean, I'll make a request for them  to explain why this workflow is apparently misbehaving.  I did not add a new test patient to check this.  Well, I think a new patient is working.  The patient portal for, like I said,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  by adding the patient again for their follow-up appointments.  Moving forward, however, the duplicate accounts  are linked to different things and also are still not<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  registered on the patient portal.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And so I don't know if they can be deleted and re-added.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  But yeah, those are.  I mean, what I see that there are just four patient portal  accounts active right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And who are those patients, if you don't mind?  Because one should be Anoop, which I created.  One is Anoop.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  One is, you could call it, pronounce it probably,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Sira with a double R.  OK.  Yeah, that was my patient that I had added a new patient  yesterday.  So I scheduled her.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  I was using, that's my patient.  But since I wanted to see how it was working,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I had added my own new patient yesterday.  And so today, she was sent the invitation.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  I know that that went through.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  But the ones that were sent before,  and Daria said that you have to put  in the email for the registration to be complete.  But of course you do, because that's  highlighted with the asterisk.  And you cannot add the patient without putting in the email.  So that's not, I mean, that's not the reason  why it wasn't registered.  So I think there should be some accountability that it was not  set up yesterday even, because I know that because I<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  had made a new test patient.  See, the one thing that I would like to mention here  is that the static on the email address,  I mean, it's actually for the mandatory fields.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  But the email one.  Exactly.  Yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  But I actually want to add something,  that the one on email is not that much of restrictive.  So there are chances that when you do not put an email,  and then there is a static on the email section,  you still hit the Save button, and it lets you save.  And that is.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, well, since there was an asterisk,  we did enter it all the time when we scheduled the patients,  because it was violated in red.  So it's not that we didn't enter that.  So that's not the problem there.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  And then I see Stephanie and Samantha.  So these are the four patients who actually have  active patient portal accounts.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, so Stephanie, those are the two  that I created.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  So at the end now, if you see they have duplicate accounts.  In the patient section?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Maybe not.  Samantha might not have a duplicate account,  because I was on the phone with you while setting it up.  But however, she got the email, she was in a rush.  So she couldn't change her password<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  if she needs to do that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  But if that's active, that sounds accurate.  But for Samantha Cooper, there's a duplicate account,  if you notice, for her.  Because I was only able to complete that.  Making her follow up appointment in one month,  and then creating a duplicate account  and scheduling it that way.  But that's not linked to Dr. Sena's note.  OK.  One is having an email address in there.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  And then the other one, let me just see, for Stephanie Cooper.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  They all have the email address in there.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  So for instance, we have two accounts for Ms. Cooper.  One of them is account number 19.  The other one is account number 25.  So account number 25 is the one which is having,  what do we call that, which is having the patient portal<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  And how do I know that?  I'll let you know.  Just give me one quick moment.  Well, I can see that as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  But what I'm saying is now that there's two duplicate accounts.  One has the patient note on it for today,  when Dr. Sena saw the patient.  However, the other one is linked to the next appointment.  So now there's a problem with the duplicate account.  If I had known how to delete the patients before the last two  of Dr. Sena's today, because I'm still using  my old electronic medical record,  I had only entered Breonna's, Sienna, myself,  what Dr. Sena is talking about, so that I  can reduce her frustration.  OK.  All right.  So what I need to be done is that for all of Dr. Sena's<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  patients from Monday, she had four.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Tuesday, she had four.  And I believe today she had three.  Maybe the first one didn't show.  So there must be one other one today  where she doesn't have an account set up  and machine portal accounts are set up.  And if you go on to any of those stations,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  you'll see at the top that it says registration pending.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  However, their emails are entered in there.  Yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  It says registration pending where?  Where do you go to see that?  If you go on the patient and patient demographic.  In the patient and in the patient demographics.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  And then at the top where it says, it will say in orange.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  OK, portal active for this one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Let me see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  Just one moment.  But this says registration pending.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  Give me one quick moment.  I'm doing a little bit of testing with one of the people<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  from the product team.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  Please bear with me, OK?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  Just give me like two minutes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank you.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  And how many patients did you say  that they have duplicate accounts almost?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So about four.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  OK, Stephanie Cooper and the other one is?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Samantha Gunderson.  Samantha, OK.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  Sammy, I would be making a question for the product team.  So we would be able to get back to you with a resolution<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  by tomorrow morning, first half.  OK.  So OK, can you just, Mike, or whoever, know that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  I sure will.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'll let them know.  Yeah, I tried to find a workaround.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  And I know it might have complicated things.  But the patient.  I absolutely understand what you're saying.  I'll let them know as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'll tag them.  OK, so tomorrow morning, what are you working on?  Which time zone are you working on?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  The Eastern time zone that we work at.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Are you in the Eastern time zone?  And today I was more open.  But tomorrow I have a full day of my own patient.  You can contact myself.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  And what would be your cell number?  OK, I already have your cell number.  I believe that's ending 0732.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, this is my cell phone number.  And then do you have a nucs as well, 36047?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  Say that number one more time.  It's 360.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  468-0377.  Perfect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  I am going to be trying to make someone reach out to you<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  by 9 o'clock your time.  Is that OK?  It can be by 8 o'clock because I'm  starting to see my own patients at 9 o'clock.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  8 AM PST.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Sure, all right.  And the earlier the better because we have to re-add.  I don't know if you can send the portal invites.  Because like I said.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  I understand.  So you'll be contacting us via phone or email?  I believe that you'd be contacted via phone.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, because the problem is that we put a note in there  that we'd also like, if possible, an email if we're  unable to answer.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  I sure will.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  All right?  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  Sami, thank you for your time.  An apology for this inconvenience that you had.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, and are you working on other issues<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  as well that I talked to Daria about this morning?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Or is that somebody else?  I actually am at the support side.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  It was actually that I was covering the PST time zone<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  today.  So Nick informed me because I was the only one  available in the office.  However, outside of the application,  those issues are at?  What's that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  I wanted to ask that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, those other issues?  Oh, OK.  The other issues are that Daria had not put the documents  or changed the template like she was supposed to.  We went over this morning, and she said to give us a call.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  Oh, that's going to be taken care of by implementation.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Just because we're going to be scheduling Daria's mutation.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  So OK, yeah, I think moving forward it is working.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  But all right.  OK.  All right.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  Thank you for your time.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Bye-bye.  OK, bye.<br>",13015290732,,,,"brad.collins, peter.moore",Client Facing,Electronic Health Record,553
