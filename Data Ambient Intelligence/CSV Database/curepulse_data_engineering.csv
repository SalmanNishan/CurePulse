Date of service was August 1st and the name of the doctor was Dr. Baranel?  Steven Cavazos.  Dr. Baranel you said?  Yeah, Cavazos, that's right.  Cavazos.  Yes, that was the name of the doctor's and the purpose of that phone call was because we submitted a claim to Insurance Well Fleet and your insurance actually denied that claim because they sent a questionnaire to your address to fill out that information and send it back to them so they can update the coordination of benefit.  Okay.  They requested some information but that information was not provided to them.  No.  And you're not going to see here because your insurance responded that Insurance Well Fleet has requested some information related to the accident and injury, details from the patient.  To update the patient's plan, please request the patient to fill out the required accident form letter and send it back to the insurance reprocessing for the claim.  So either you can call Well Fleet and provide them that information.  We're based out of New York?  Yes, we are based in New York.  We are a medical billing company.

Thank you for asking.  Can you tell me the name of the doctor's office?  It's Vascular Centers.  What it is exactly?  Could you repeat that, please?  Vascular Centers.  We do not have anything with the name.  Is the patient with you?  OK.  The doctor is K-H-A-R-I.  Are you the patient's wife?  Is the last name.  I'm his wife, yes.  So you have received a bill for the patient?  Yes.  Can you tell me the account number of the patient, please?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The account number for Dr. Bakari's office?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Stella Adams</span></b>:  Yes.  49510.

Let me check.  OK.  Just a second.  So the first bill, which is for 7-10-2023, what I can see here,  it's $95, which is the co-payment of the patient.  And second bill, what I can see for 7-17-2023, which is $56.23.  Let me check.  That's also a co-pay.  That's the co-payment amount, ma'am.  OK.  So UnitedHealthcare paid that part.  So does the Medicaid. <span style=""color:red""><b>  They covered all the charges, but they will only  charge you for the co-pay</b></span>.

You need to speak to your Medicare  and ask them if they are covering  the co-pay for the patient, so you can let us know so that we  could resubmit the payment.

As per the details, what I can guess, if they will,  you can just let us know so that we could resubmit the co-pay.  No, because the co-pays are not covered.  We'll get a denial simply.

I can see only two here.  One of them is $95.  One of them is $56.23.  $56.23 is four.  As per the details, it's a co-pay.  For the what?  As per the details, what I can guess, if they will,  you can just let us know so that we could resubmit the co-pay.  No, because the co-pays are not covered.  We'll get a denial simply.  So if they are willing, then just let us know  so that we could resubmit it.  But insurance does not cover the co-pay.  That's why I'm asking you to contact insurance.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Gotcha.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Stella Adams</span></b>:  So they can resubmit.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, gotcha.  All right, I appreciate your help.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Stella Adams</span></b>:  Thank you, ma'am.  Thank you for understanding.  Anything else besides that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No, I don't have dirty.  Thank you so much.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Stella Adams</span></b>:  Thank you.  Have a great day.  Goodbye.  See who I was calling.<br>"

So, on this note template that I'm – at headers, if I try to right-click on either<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  one of them, I can see that there's a little bit of a difference.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I think it's very possible we might be looking at different – referring to different parts  of the application.

Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  All right.  I see what's happening.

Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  So, what's happening on my end is that I right-clicked on one of the images and it gave me a little  – gave me that little dropdown and I clicked on remove image and that removed the image</b></span>.  But I'm clicking on the other one and it's not doing anything and I think it's not going  to let me delete if I backspace either.  Yeah, it's not.  Image deletion not allowed.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  And that's the one I want deleted.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Well, there's only one showing up now.

Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I'll have to look at that because it's not going to take me a while.  It says image deletion not allowed.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Whatever it might be.  Of course, that was going to be – my discussion was going to be the estimate for the two different  methods.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I see what's happening.  This is reportable.  I'd have to report this.  But just give me one second.  Let me quickly confirm with someone else as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  I did want to let you know that –<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  May I come back?  Yeah, the pocket mask.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  But I did underestimate on some of the cost of the treatment shows – the insurance company  is showing that he's almost met it out of pocket but the balance on what he owes the  practice is $300, a little over $300</b></span>.  So I want to be able to still spread that out for you guys.  I was going to spread that out over the next treatment.  But if he's not getting treatment, we can still spread that out.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So I just deleted the imaging question and I saved.  This is almost embarrassing.  I just – I pressed backspace and clicked on save really quickly.  I didn't let that dialog box pop up that said, initially should not allow.  Yeah, I just didn't allow that to happen.  I just pressed backspace and clicked save at exactly the same time.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Good to know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  It sounds ridiculous but for future reference.  And then to download a template.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  So I went and I took that and uploaded it</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Do you want to download a template?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, I pushed it to the library.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So you have to go – just one second.  I believe you go back to the library. <span style=""color:red""><b>  So you go to the template library and you pull it from there</b></span>.  Alright, so up at the top right where it's displaying your name, if you click on the  downward arrow and click on template library.  There we go.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  And now if you search for –  I go template.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  And then if you search for it – so if you've put a tag on the template, you can search  it by that.  That's usually a quicker way.  Because there's a good deal of –<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Got it.  And then one more question.  Go ahead.  Can you see a QMDA window now?  Do you think switch to the window?  I see it.  I see it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So this is a Windows virtual machine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Windows 11.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  11?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yep.  So I'm going in here and if I download and then try to launch Explorer, if not, like<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'll hit launch Explorer and it just clashes something and then goes back to here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  And like for the life of me, is there something weird under Windows 11?  No, it should work on any Windows version.  Like some version?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Joseph, I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Joseph, I apologize.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So I'm calling regarding the grandpa and the garden.  We had a reporter –  Yeah, there.  Start the client.  I think your screen is frozen.  I'm not really following what's happening.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Is it still frozen?  No, it's working now.  But I think I saw for a second when you opened up your dual bar down here that the client<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  utility is running in the background.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Well, sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  It is, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  But it's still –  You get settings and exit.  But it's still asking you for – okay.  Could you click on open logs for me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Just one second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Could you exit out of the utility?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Like down here?  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Just completely exit out of it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  And then open up this BC.  If you click on your search bar down there and type in this BC to open that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  And then go to drive C, I believe.  And then go to program files 86.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I've been doing this for you, but for some reason I can't take control.  Program files 86.  Open QM Decorporation.  There should be a folder that says that.  Good.  Good.  I can make sure it's not in the alt text just in case your test scan was approved.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  And open QM D HCT PS server.  Right click the CMD HCT P server file that you see.  It's at the top.  It's the application file.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  This one.  Yeah.  Oh, that one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  And click on run as administrator.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  Could you try it?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Could you exit out of the application and then...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Launch Explorer.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Actually, if you could exit out of the application and then relaunch.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, out of the...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Application.  Which you just exited out of.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Now log back in.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I'm going to close Chrome too.  Also, I noticed that you were...  That to exit out of the application you were just exiting out by hitting the cross button  on the top right.  Generally, as a rule of thumb, we recommend to our clients that they actually log out  of the application because there are a number of problems that are caused by just hitting  across the top right.  So a full log out.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So full log out is what we recommend.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  This is taking an abnormally long time.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Exit out and then try again, I guess.  No, this is taking way too long.  Could you restart your system?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Hi, this is Madison.  Hi, Madison.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I'm going to start with the information I spoke to Dr. Ovi about the cardiac question  that you had.  Of course.  Of course.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You said a little bit about that with her.  How is that a little bit?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Dr. Shimabu, is that worth it for you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Clear.  This is running in parallel on a...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Oh, of course it is.  Brian, have a good day.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  On a map.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  As in what's it called again?  As in what's it called again?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No, well, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  No, I don't know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I mean, I'm just letting you know so that you understand sort of the full system.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah, I understand.  Can you see my screen again or not?  I see it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  I'm just going to wait until these things load here.  Okay.

So I want to be able to still spread that out for you guys.  I was going to spread that out over the next treatment.  But if he's not getting treatment, we can still spread that out.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So I just deleted the imaging question and I saved.  This is almost embarrassing.  I just – I pressed backspace and clicked on save really quickly.  I didn't let that dialog box pop up that said, initially should not allow.  Yeah, I just didn't allow that to happen.  I just pressed backspace and clicked save at exactly the same time.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Good to know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  It sounds ridiculous but for future reference.

I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Is it still frozen?  No, it's working now.

So, on this note template that I'm – at headers, if I try to right-click on either<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  one of them, I can see that there's a little bit of a difference.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I think it's very possible we might be looking at different – referring to different parts  of the application.  Can we do an AnyDesk session so that we're looking at the same thing?  Sure.  I'll give you a moment.  Do you have AnyDesk installed on your system?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm going to do it right now.

This is Troy.  How can I help you?  Hi there.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I was trying to get to Hasom.  Hasom?  Yeah.  If I call somebody's extension, does it not actually go to their voicemail or something?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Let me check with Hasom and I'll transfer you to him.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Thanks.  You're welcome.  And I'm sorry, who am I speaking with?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  My name is Kurt Campbell from Cancer and Blood Care Specialists.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  All right.  So, Hasom is available.  I'm going to transfer you right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Hi.  Good afternoon.  Hello.  How are you?  Hey.  So, I was – good.  I need to chat real quick.  So, a couple of things.  So, on this note template that I'm – at headers, if I try to right-click on either<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  one of them, I can see that there's a little bit of a difference.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I think it's very possible we might be looking at different – referring to different parts  of the application.  Can we do an AnyDesk session so that we're looking at the same thing?  Sure.  I'll give you a moment.  Do you have AnyDesk installed on your system?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm going to do it right now.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Once you have it up and running, just share your address.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  You ready?  Seven, nine, seven, eight, nine, ten.  Seven, nine, seven, eight.  Seven, nine, seven, eight.  Seven, nine, eight.  You should see a prompt on your end.  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Can you see mine?  I can see it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  All right.  I see what's happening.  This is –<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Oh, it's been inserted twice and it's not – okay.  Let me just open it up from my end.  This is the MDVisit follow-up.  Just give me one second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  This looks like a bug.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, okay.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So, what's happening on my end is that I right-clicked on one of the images and it gave me a little  – gave me that little dropdown and I clicked on remove image and that removed the image.  But I'm clicking on the other one and it's not doing anything and I think it's not going  to let me delete if I backspace either.  Yeah, it's not.  Image deletion not allowed.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  And that's the one I want deleted.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Well, there's only one showing up now.  Yeah, but that's the one I want deleted.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  That's the one you want deleted.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I'll have to look at that because it's not going to take me a while.  It says image deletion not allowed.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Whatever it might be.  Of course, that was going to be – my discussion was going to be the estimate for the two different  methods.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I see what's happening.  This is reportable.  I'd have to report this.  But just give me one second.  Let me quickly confirm with someone else as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  I did want to let you know that –<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  May I come back?  Yeah, the pocket mask.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  But I did underestimate on some of the cost of the treatment shows – the insurance company  is showing that he's almost met it out of pocket but the balance on what he owes the  practice is $300, a little over $300.  So I want to be able to still spread that out for you guys.  I was going to spread that out over the next treatment.  But if he's not getting treatment, we can still spread that out.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So I just deleted the imaging question and I saved.  This is almost embarrassing.  I just – I pressed backspace and clicked on save really quickly.  I didn't let that dialog box pop up that said, initially should not allow.  Yeah, I just didn't allow that to happen.  I just pressed backspace and clicked save at exactly the same time.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Good to know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  It sounds ridiculous but for future reference.  And then to download a template.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I went and I took that and uploaded it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Do you want to download a template?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, I pushed it to the library.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So you have to go – just one second.  I believe you go back to the library. <span style=""color:red""><b>  So you go to the template library and you pull it from there</b></span>.  Alright, so up at the top right where it's displaying your name, if you click on the  downward arrow and click on template library.  There we go.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  And now if you search for –  I go template.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  And then if you search for it – so if you've put a tag on the template, you can search  it by that.  That's usually a quicker way.  Because there's a good deal of –<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Got it.  And then one more question.  Go ahead.  Can you see a QMDA window now?  Do you think switch to the window?  I see it.  I see it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So this is a Windows virtual machine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Windows 11.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  11?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yep.  So I'm going in here and if I download and then try to launch Explorer, if not, like<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'll hit launch Explorer and it just clashes something and then goes back to here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  And like for the life of me, is there something weird under Windows 11?  No, it should work on any Windows version.  Like some version?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Joseph, I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Joseph, I apologize.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So I'm calling regarding the grandpa and the garden.  We had a reporter –  Yeah, there.  Start the client.  I think your screen is frozen.  I'm not really following what's happening.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Is it still frozen?  No, it's working now.  But I think I saw for a second when you opened up your dual bar down here that the client<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  utility is running in the background.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Well, sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  It is, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  But it's still –  You get settings and exit.  But it's still asking you for – okay.  Could you click on open logs for me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Just one second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Could you exit out of the utility?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Like down here?  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Just completely exit out of it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  And then open up this BC.  If you click on your search bar down there and type in this BC to open that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  And then go to drive C, I believe.  And then go to program files 86.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I've been doing this for you, but for some reason I can't take control.  Program files 86.  Open QM Decorporation.  There should be a folder that says that.  Good.  Good.  I can make sure it's not in the alt text just in case your test scan was approved.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  And open QM D HCT PS server.  Right click the CMD HCT P server file that you see.  It's at the top.  It's the application file.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  This one.  Yeah.  Oh, that one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  And click on run as administrator.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  Could you try it?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Could you exit out of the application and then...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Launch Explorer.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Actually, if you could exit out of the application and then relaunch.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, out of the...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Application.  Which you just exited out of.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Now log back in.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I'm going to close Chrome too.  Also, I noticed that you were...  That to exit out of the application you were just exiting out by hitting the cross button  on the top right.  Generally, as a rule of thumb, we recommend to our clients that they actually log out  of the application because there are a number of problems that are caused by just hitting  across the top right.  So a full log out.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So full log out is what we recommend.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  This is taking an abnormally long time.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Exit out and then try again, I guess.  No, this is taking way too long.  Could you restart your system?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Hi, this is Madison.  Hi, Madison.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I'm going to start with the information I spoke to Dr. Ovi about the cardiac question  that you had.  Of course.  Of course.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You said a little bit about that with her.  How is that a little bit?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Dr. Shimabu, is that worth it for you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Clear.  This is running in parallel on a...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Oh, of course it is.  Brian, have a good day.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  On a map.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  As in what's it called again?  As in what's it called again?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No, well, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  No, I don't know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I mean, I'm just letting you know so that you understand sort of the full system.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah, I understand.  Can you see my screen again or not?  I see it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  I'm just going to wait until these things load here.  Okay.  So KRAMD loaded.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  All right.  And if you could check the document manager again.  Nice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Thank you.  I appreciate it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No problem.  No problem.  It's okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Is there anything else I can help you with?  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Thank you.<br>","<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Thank you so much for contacting CureMD.

Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I'm going to close Chrome too.  Also, I noticed that you were...  That to exit out of the application you were just exiting out by hitting the cross button  on the top right.  Generally, as a rule of thumb, we recommend to our clients that they actually log out  of the application because there are a number of problems that are caused by just hitting  across the top right.  So a full log out.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So full log out is what we recommend.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  This is taking an abnormally long time.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Exit out and then try again, I guess.  No, this is taking way too long.

This is the one.  You said it's for the board, no?  Yes.  It's because it's going to be like in general.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  In general?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  Okay.  I remember that Joe told me like how but not because he knows that it's like.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  So, these are all of the locations, if you have a look at this one.  These are all the locations selected.  These are all the plans selected at this moment. <span style=""color:red""><b>  Any specific provider you want to select or any status at this moment</b></span>.  So, these are all the, you can say, fee schedules.  me open one of them. Suppose that for Medicaid MA, this is the fee schedule. If I click on  it, this will show you all the CPTs added over here with the relevant prices. So when  you'll be making a charge page for this specific insurance over here, so you'll see these charges  populating on the charge page. So if you have any idea for which you can save fee schedule  are you talking about, suppose for Brownsville, do you want to change some prices? The location  is this and for all of the plans. You'll click on the specific fee schedule from here on  the hyperlink. <span style=""color:red""><b> This would take you to this interface over here</b></span>. You see these procedures  over here. Okay. And I believe that you do not have the authority to add it, but let  me show this to you that you can change the prices for this one. Suppose if I write down  this code, maybe this is in there. Yes. 99215. So you can change the price from here by changing  the price to $12 whatsoever price over here and here and then hit save and it would be  changed. You do not have the authority, Grace, but I can change it for you if you can guide  me for which fee schedule do you want to change the prices. Okay. Can you open up the provider  of Rafat? Yep. The last one. Okay. Perfect. So I'll hit search. So there's no such specified,  you can say, a fee schedule made for Rafat Qureshi at this moment. Maybe you can guide  me about the location. If there's any location in most probably that we can find you see  from here. No worries. You can ask them. Maybe we can check it from the patients. Most probably  you can also check it from the patient. Suppose if we go to a patient over here, this is Maria  and the demographics are open. So let's have a look. So she has a location for McAllen  Advanced. This gives you an idea that when you will be selecting this location on the  charge page, the fee schedule for this location would be populating over there. So McAllen  Advanced it is. I'll go back to the settings module, billing, fee schedule. And if I select  that specific McAllen one, if I have that, this over here. So let's hit search maybe.  Yes, you see. So what whatsoever prices you will be writing down over here for that specific<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  patient, the prices... Okay. I don't recall how... I'm sorry? Yeah, I'm trying to remember  when Joel explained to me. I know there was, I don't know if there's another way because<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  I don't recall... There's another way as well. If you go to CP... Yeah, I remember the extra  feature. Okay. Then you can do it from here as well. Hence it's recommended to change  it from the fee schedule, but it's fine. So there's this fee schedule and then there's  this procedure code. Suppose if I am going to a CPT code 99215, I hit search from the  hyperlink. I'll click over here. And do you see the flat charges here? Put down what whatsoever  flat charges you want to put. Suppose $10. Okay. I'll put it over here. Click over here.  If I hit save, what it would do is that whatsoever 99215 which you'd be putting. Suppose if I'm  changing $10 over here, it's for all of the patients. Okay. For the fee schedule, you  are giving criteria to specific location, specific provider, specific plans, but for  this you are generically giving $10 to just specific procedure code. So if I'm hitting  save from here, what would happen is that if I go to this specific patient, I'll change  it back just to show you this is just a test. So I'll give go to quick charge. I'll put  down this procedure code just to show you that what would happen. So 99215, I'll hit  that. Okay. Maybe this price is coming from a fee schedule. Yes, a fee schedule. This  procedure code is already added in one of the fee schedules. That's the reason it's  not coming forward. Let me check if Joe can guide me on it that maybe he gave you. Let  me see. Let me change. Let me just, yes, go ahead with the procedure code I'm listing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, it's going to be the 62323. And we have to change it for 3495. 3495. Oh, sorry. Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  Give me a moment. So this is 3495 for the procedure. Let me just check most of the fee  schedules which are active instead of the Medicare ones. What was the procedure code?  Can you remind me 62323. Okay, it's not in this fee schedule. 62323. You need to go.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You need to change the location because yeah, it's fine. I'm just checking if it's for 62323.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  I'm just basically checking that is it in one of them. But anyhow, let's check it on  the patient first off in the McAllen one as this patient has a location of McAllen. Let  me make a quick charge. I changed it in the procedures irrespective of the location adding  it in any fee schedule. Let me just check this for 62323. It's coming from, you see  it did. Now, now I locate that where is it coming from. <span style=""color:red""><b> So when I once I click over here,  you see the sliding fee scale is active for this patient</b></span>. Yeah, that's what I'm telling<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  you. Like Joe showed me another way that I would just go get the CPT code, put that it's  in another window because we never say nothing about all of the location. We never talk about  that. He just said you go to the building, the fee schedule, and then you put the procedure  and then it's going to come up and then from there you change it. So when he there where  you are right, we will put that CPT code, it will come up and we would make the changes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  How come the sliding fee scale is working for this one? I am confused. Just a moment<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  please. 62323. What was the price? This window. Is this window. Is this window. How do you<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  come to this window? I basically went to the fee schedule. Okay. This is the out of fee  schedule you were basically working with. You went to the names, you will write down<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  pain management updated. Ah, okay. I knew I would do pain management. Pain management.  That's the window that I'm looking for. What was the price? $3,000. $3,495. You cannot<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  save it from here. Let me just save it for you. I believe I have opened up. Just give<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  me a moment. I'm changing it. You cannot save it because we don't have access. I do. I do.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  Okay. Anyhow, I can change it for you. You can change it from your end as well. Give  me a moment. I'm just changing it. Okay. Okay. Basically, you guys need to figure out that  what kind of fee schedules are you guys using at this moment? Just like this one. Pain management  updated. It's for all of the locations, all of the providers. Just figure this out because  this can cause an issue because there are multiple fee schedules. I understand that  there must be some confusion. I've basically figured it out from the patient's account.  Let me give myself rights as well for the fee schedule. Okay. I got them. Let me add  this price up and then we'll check it for this patient just to see that it changed or  not. Our first motive is to change it from the fee schedule because there are multiple  fee schedules on the basis of plans as well. The procedure one won't help you guys. It  would just be directly changing for all of them. It wouldn't be the screen, the fee schedule.  We need to go to the procedure. No, no, no. You have to go to the fee schedule. You were<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  right. You have to open it. Let me just show it. It was 3,495, right? Pardon me? It was<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  3,495. $3,495 for this procedure code. Okay. I've changed it from the backend. I'll write  down the procedure code. 62323. Here you go. Now, whenever you have to get an idea which  fee schedule is active, you see this dollar sign over here, hover over it and you'll see  pain management updated. So you'll get the idea, okay, this fee schedule is active. Now  if I have to change something, I have to go to this specific fee schedule. You see pain  management updated. So you go to the settings from here, go to the billing site, click over  it, click on the fee schedule and on the name side you search pain management. And once  you do it, you'll find this one. You'll click on it and then you can change the prices.  I believe, Sonia, you would be having this one, add procedure and stuff like that on  your fee schedule. So you can add the procedures, you can change the prices and there would  be a save button over here. You hit save and that's about it. Okay. Well, thank you very<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  much. The thing is that I think I misplaced my notes and missed Grace too. No worries.  That's fine. Anything else?

Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  So, you have to go to the fee schedule and go to the fee schedule.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  I'm going to go to the fee schedule.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  I will.  I will.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  Setting, setting, billing.  Billing and then fee schedule.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Uh-huh.  And then?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  And for which location or insurance do you want to change it for?  Do you have an idea about this one?  That's the thing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  When I open this window, why don't I don't recall opening this window?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  No worries.  For which patient are you changing it for?  Let me check that patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  This is the one?  This is the one.  This is the one.  This is the one.  You said it's for the board, no?  Yes.  It's because it's going to be like in general.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  In general?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  Okay.  I remember that Joe told me like how but not because he knows that it's like.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  So, these are all of the locations, if you have a look at this one.  These are all the locations selected.  These are all the plans selected at this moment.  Any specific provider you want to select or any status at this moment.  So, these are all the, you can say, fee schedules.  me open one of them. Suppose that for Medicaid MA, this is the fee schedule. If I click on  it, this will show you all the CPTs added over here with the relevant prices. So when  you'll be making a charge page for this specific insurance over here, so you'll see these charges  populating on the charge page. So if you have any idea for which you can save fee schedule  are you talking about, suppose for Brownsville, do you want to change some prices? The location  is this and for all of the plans. You'll click on the specific fee schedule from here on  the hyperlink. <span style=""color:red""><b> This would take you to this interface over here</b></span>. You see these procedures  over here. Okay. And I believe that you do not have the authority to add it, but let  me show this to you that you can change the prices for this one. Suppose if I write down  this code, maybe this is in there. Yes. 99215. So you can change the price from here by changing  the price to $12 whatsoever price over here and here and then hit save and it would be  changed. You do not have the authority, Grace, but I can change it for you if you can guide  me for which fee schedule do you want to change the prices. Okay. Can you open up the provider  of Rafat? Yep. The last one. Okay. Perfect. So I'll hit search. So there's no such specified,  you can say, a fee schedule made for Rafat Qureshi at this moment. Maybe you can guide  me about the location. If there's any location in most probably that we can find you see  from here. No worries. You can ask them. Maybe we can check it from the patients. Most probably  you can also check it from the patient. Suppose if we go to a patient over here, this is Maria  and the demographics are open. So let's have a look. So she has a location for McAllen  Advanced. This gives you an idea that when you will be selecting this location on the  charge page, the fee schedule for this location would be populating over there. So McAllen  Advanced it is. I'll go back to the settings module, billing, fee schedule. And if I select  that specific McAllen one, if I have that, this over here. So let's hit search maybe.  Yes, you see. So what whatsoever prices you will be writing down over here for that specific<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  patient, the prices... Okay. I don't recall how... I'm sorry? Yeah, I'm trying to remember  when Joel explained to me. I know there was, I don't know if there's another way because<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  I don't recall... There's another way as well. If you go to CP... Yeah, I remember the extra  feature. Okay. Then you can do it from here as well. Hence it's recommended to change  it from the fee schedule, but it's fine. So there's this fee schedule and then there's  this procedure code. Suppose if I am going to a CPT code 99215, I hit search from the  hyperlink. I'll click over here. And do you see the flat charges here? Put down what whatsoever  flat charges you want to put. Suppose $10. Okay. I'll put it over here. Click over here.  If I hit save, what it would do is that whatsoever 99215 which you'd be putting. Suppose if I'm  changing $10 over here, it's for all of the patients. Okay. For the fee schedule, you  are giving criteria to specific location, specific provider, specific plans, but for  this you are generically giving $10 to just specific procedure code. So if I'm hitting  save from here, what would happen is that if I go to this specific patient, I'll change  it back just to show you this is just a test. So I'll give go to quick charge. I'll put  down this procedure code just to show you that what would happen. So 99215, I'll hit  that. Okay. Maybe this price is coming from a fee schedule. Yes, a fee schedule. This  procedure code is already added in one of the fee schedules. That's the reason it's  not coming forward. Let me check if Joe can guide me on it that maybe he gave you. Let  me see. Let me change. Let me just, yes, go ahead with the procedure code I'm listing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, it's going to be the 62323. And we have to change it for 3495. 3495. Oh, sorry. Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  Give me a moment. So this is 3495 for the procedure. Let me just check most of the fee  schedules which are active instead of the Medicare ones. What was the procedure code?  Can you remind me 62323. Okay, it's not in this fee schedule. 62323. You need to go.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You need to change the location because yeah, it's fine. I'm just checking if it's for 62323.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  I'm just basically checking that is it in one of them. But anyhow, let's check it on  the patient first off in the McAllen one as this patient has a location of McAllen. Let  me make a quick charge. I changed it in the procedures irrespective of the location adding  it in any fee schedule. Let me just check this for 62323. It's coming from, you see  it did. Now, now I locate that where is it coming from. So when I once I click over here,  you see the sliding fee scale is active for this patient. Yeah, that's what I'm telling<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  you. Like Joe showed me another way that I would just go get the CPT code, put that it's  in another window because we never say nothing about all of the location. We never talk about  that. He just said you go to the building, the fee schedule, and then you put the procedure  and then it's going to come up and then from there you change it. So when he there where  you are right, we will put that CPT code, it will come up and we would make the changes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  How come the sliding fee scale is working for this one? I am confused. Just a moment<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  please. 62323. What was the price? This window. Is this window. Is this window. How do you<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  come to this window? I basically went to the fee schedule. Okay. This is the out of fee  schedule you were basically working with. You went to the names, you will write down<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  pain management updated. Ah, okay. I knew I would do pain management. Pain management.  That's the window that I'm looking for. What was the price? $3,000. $3,495. You cannot<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  save it from here. Let me just save it for you. I believe I have opened up. Just give<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  me a moment. I'm changing it. You cannot save it because we don't have access. I do. I do.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  Okay. Anyhow, I can change it for you. You can change it from your end as well. Give  me a moment. I'm just changing it. Okay. Okay. Basically, you guys need to figure out that  what kind of fee schedules are you guys using at this moment? Just like this one. Pain management  updated. It's for all of the locations, all of the providers. Just figure this out because  this can cause an issue because there are multiple fee schedules. I understand that  there must be some confusion. I've basically figured it out from the patient's account.  Let me give myself rights as well for the fee schedule. Okay. I got them. Let me add  this price up and then we'll check it for this patient just to see that it changed or  not. Our first motive is to change it from the fee schedule because there are multiple  fee schedules on the basis of plans as well. The procedure one won't help you guys. It  would just be directly changing for all of them. It wouldn't be the screen, the fee schedule.  We need to go to the procedure. No, no, no. You have to go to the fee schedule. You were<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  right. You have to open it. Let me just show it. It was 3,495, right? Pardon me? It was<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Christy Wilson</span></b>:  3,495. $3,495 for this procedure code. Okay. I've changed it from the backend. I'll write  down the procedure code. 62323. Here you go. Now, whenever you have to get an idea which  fee schedule is active, you see this dollar sign over here, hover over it and you'll see  pain management updated. So you'll get the idea, okay, this fee schedule is active. Now  if I have to change something, I have to go to this specific fee schedule. You see pain  management updated. So you go to the settings from here, go to the billing site, click over  it, click on the fee schedule and on the name side you search pain management. And once  you do it, you'll find this one. You'll click on it and then you can change the prices.  I believe, Sonia, you would be having this one, add procedure and stuff like that on  your fee schedule. So you can add the procedures, you can change the prices and there would  be a save button over here. You hit save and that's about it. Okay. Well, thank you very<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  much. The thing is that I think I misplaced my notes and missed Grace too. No worries.  That's fine. Anything else?

So like right here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Owen Adams</span></b>:  Right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So this is the date.  And then all state of last PAP tests, they need to be in a date format.  So I just want to make sure because the last time they said that if we make any reports,  so that's why I see that, it has to be in that.  Alright.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Owen Adams</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  Could you do one thing?  Can you log into CurmMD over here please?</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Log into CurmMD.  Alright.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Owen Adams</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  I believe we don't have access to the custom forms over here</b></span>.

Let me log in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Owen Adams</span></b>:  Because I'm pretty sure that we didn't, I mean, not either from your side or from our  side somehow, how we have messed up with the forms.  So I think the values are over there.  It's just that within these custom forms, the values are not selected.  So that is the reason you're probably getting those errors.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Alright.  And if you want us to share this, pressure share it as well, what the state forms are  still working on.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Owen Adams</span></b>:  So the values are there.  Can you share the patient examples or the error report that you got from state?  Can you open that up?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Alright.

What is that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Owen Adams</span></b>:  I'm sorry?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It needs to put it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Owen Adams</span></b>:  So you see the diagnostic disposition date, it's not entered.  But I think the error for this one is the other one, right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So that one has to be a date format.  It's 129456.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Owen Adams</span></b>:  Additional procedure needed.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Alright.  That's another one for the patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Owen Adams</span></b>:  And diagnostic disposition date should be 128.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So date for last PAM.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Owen Adams</span></b>:  Now where is that?  So since we have selected the third value, client at the previous PAM test, she doesn't  know what year.  Actually, there should be a value over here that is 555 since you didn't select the date.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So that is one thing.  But that statement, it should fill it in, right?  Yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Owen Adams</span></b>:  So you see this?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And it didn't.  Or she needs to manually enter those 555.  No, no, no.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Owen Adams</span></b>:  I mean, if the date is selected, I mean the value selected within the custom form, it  should populate over here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So that is one thing it's not populating.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Owen Adams</span></b>:  So the other one was, let me check, additional procedure needed.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes, yes, wire.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Owen Adams</span></b>:  Additional procedures needed to complete cycle.  Now this value is not selected over here.  But you're getting, now, these are the basic, these are the records.  These are the requirements.  And somehow, these values are interlinked with each other.  So if you're not selecting the value within the custom form, it's going to send us the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  error.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Owen Adams</span></b>:  And diagnostic disposition.

I agree.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Daniel Watson</span></b>:  I'll definitely, you know, this thing like it logs you out.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I will definitely forward it to the IT team and I'll have the team drop some news.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Daniel Watson</span></b>:  There's usually some kind of issue that they fix later on, but in the start there is, so I will definitely make it known that Joanna, the love of my life, is having this issue.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Now don't tell Ian. That's supposed to be my house.  I won't.  No worries. Do you have anything else for me today? I'm still waiting.  Dr. Miller and I have penned in time, it's not even pencilled, it's penned in time tomorrow to go over this problem list. So you should have a response from me tomorrow afternoon on the outstanding list that we've got.  Okay. Okay.  And okay.  I have to give you an answer. Like now.  I really appreciate it, you know. Thank you so very much for that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Daniel Watson</span></b>:  I will wait on that and then secondly I'll call you tomorrow and I'll let you know like how to extract the reports for the missed billing, like for the patients who came in and no provider notes were made for them.  I'll let you know so you can let the providers know and we never miss out on any charge going forward.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Gotcha. Okay. That works. Thanks, Joe.  Thank you. Bye.<br>",,"<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Daniel Watson</span></b>:  Good afternoon, this is Daniel.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Hello darling, how are you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Daniel Watson</span></b>:  I am good, how are you doing?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm good, except I'm not sure what this email was you just sent me.  And then you just wanted a response on.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Daniel Watson</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  Okay, so this is, okay, these are the services for which either the super bill was not created,  or if the super bill was created, a provider note was not signed or it was left in the draft form</b></span>.  So the super bill was called in and then the charges are made.  But for the provider notes, for the day of services for which the provider notes were not created,  and the appointments weren't checked in or checked out state,  these are the day of services that are there from 2013 until 2022.  So we named them as missed billing, that means the patient came in,  following a provider note created, that is the reason why there was no charge created for these patients.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And the revenue was lost.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Daniel Watson</span></b>:  This is somehow this big list, I still appearing in the whole list of database,  and I wanted to get rid of it because there is nothing that could be done on it at this time,  because these day of services again are from 2022 and before, so these are of no use to us.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay, so am I writing off a dollar amount when we do this?  I mean, what is this going to do billing wise?  Because I don't want Dr. Miller coming back to me going, why did you authorize this?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Daniel Watson</span></b>:  No, so you are not doing anything. I'm just marking them as no charge, that no charge was created.  And if you want to do something that can be done, you know, create a charge,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  and because we in the first place didn't create a provider note,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Daniel Watson</span></b>:  that is the reason why the claim was never filed, so why bring it to the patient?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  But that is of the practices, but this is one of the things</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Daniel Watson</span></b>:  It's no increase, no loss in the overall, it will stay the same, it's just one list will be cleared out, and that's about it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay, I just want to make sure I knew what I was agreeing to before I said anything.  Absolutely.  So I don't have Dr. Miller standing on my desk tomorrow going, you just lost us $100,000?  No, no, no, that's not going to happen.  Alright, so I sent that email back to you. By the way, I don't know who created this new sign-in page thing that we're using now.  I don't like it.  The sign-in page?  It runs super slow.  The KLMD sign-in?  Yes, I liked my old sign-in and I want it back. Sorry, I didn't want to whine about something today.  Are you going on the sign-in?  The new one they sent out the other day that said we have to use this one because they're discontinuing the old one.  Is it like log in.kmd.net?  Yes, I think so. I don't like it.  Alright, but they are still doing the updates.  Just letting my opinion be known.  I will definitely make it known if they do anything about it.  Well, they are home. You know what I want to say.  Yeah, I know. I know, trust me, I'm right there with you, but I don't like it.  Yeah, me neither.  Yeah, it logs me out and the problem I'm having also is I'm normally functioning off of two CureMD screens.  Especially when I'm pulling med records.  And it will not allow me to do two screens.  On the same browser?  Correct.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Daniel Watson</span></b>:  Is there a feature for it like one is opened up in Chrome and the other one in Opera or Edge or something?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, I've figured out a workaround, but it's a pain in the rear end.

Wrong month, sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  On 828, I was supposed to have an endoscopy,  but I called and I canceled that day,  and I called the surgical center and canceled that day also.  And then I had it the following week,  and now I'm calling for the follow-up of the endoscopy  to see Jackie Amadjo or something like that.  And I think I'm having a problem with my insurance  because I didn't know that my credit card wasn't updated.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Stella Adams</span></b>:  Yada, yada.  No problem. <span style=""color:red""><b>  So the thing you want us right now  is so that is you want us to resubmit the claims to first  see our health and life, right?  OK, no problem</b></span>.  I will request my team to resubmit  the claims and everything.  OK.  The on account.  And then when I go there on Wednesday,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  it'll show that my insurance is in there,  and then it'll process that one also.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Stella Adams</span></b>:  I need to request that.  OK.  All right.  Thank you, ma'am.  Have a great day.  Goodbye.  OK.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks for that entire presentation.<br>"

Hey, Dan.  This is Kelly with Quest Diagnostics.  Hi, Kelly.  How are you?  I'm good.  How are you doing?  I'm doing good, too.  Thank you for asking.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dan Mason</span></b>:  So actually, I was calling in regards to an email  that I sent you for the results that were not  received by a large camp.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  So were you unable to find the results?  Well, not with that patient ID that you provided.  So that's why I was looking for a name and a date of service  I could take a look and see.  So the name is Linda Borah.  Can you spell that last name?  B-O-R-A-H.  All right.  Let me see what I have here.  Give me just a moment.  Sure, sure.  Do you have a date of birth that I can verify?  Date of birth.  Let me just get it on.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dan Mason</span></b>:  Just give me a second, all right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So actually, they are placing the orders  from the Quest portal.  But I think as for the implementation,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dan Mason</span></b>:  we should be receiving the results in the CureMD<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  application as well.  Is that correct?  Yes.  This account that you had provided,  it is sent to CureMD.  So any results under those accounts  will report out to that interface.  So I am looking at it.  OK, go ahead.  Let me just check.  It's going to be 1951 is the year.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dan Mason</span></b>:  It's July 12th.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Perfect.  So I'm looking at a specimen here  that was collected September the 18th.  It's logged under a house account, which  would explain why it's not in the CureMD interface.  It's because we have a result in a lab system  that we cannot tie it to an account. <span style=""color:red""><b>  So the practice would need to contact our client services  department to get that clarified and the account number updated  so that that result will cross electronically</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dan Mason</span></b>:  I did actually tell the client to contact you guys.  But the client was, you know, she was in a very bad mood,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I would say.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dan Mason</span></b>:  And she just cut off the call on my face.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So yeah.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dan Mason</span></b>:  Yeah, so I would, can you actually  go ahead and call the client if I tell you the number for her?  Let me just tell you the name of the client.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dan Mason</span></b>:  Her name is Maria Ross, sorry, Maria Rios.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Maria I-O-R-S?  Exactly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dan Mason</span></b>:  And her number is 212-988-7900.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  212-988-7900.  Exactly, exactly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Dan Mason</span></b>:  Just call this practice and, you know, ask for Maria.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I will do.

Yes, please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  026-446.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  Thank you.  Could you please show me the error? Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  This is, on all the time, we sent a controlled one that actually went...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  So it's happening for both the controlled and the...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm not sure why. Let me pull up...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  Do you mind if I put you on hold while I go ahead and work on this?  Yeah. Thank you. Thank you so much for staying online with me,  Brian. Really appreciate you. So what I'm going to do now  is I'm going to go ahead and map your practice with me, and I'm going to  try it from my end. I'm going to go ahead and try to send out a medication  to a test patient, and I'm going to see if it goes through or not.  Alright, just a second. Okay.  The non-controlled substance,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  as far as I can tell, it didn't lead to me  and the provider we have that's sending it</b></span>.  Error.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  I'm just saving this medication chart.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think the difference is<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  you want to add something to the patient's chart, but you must want<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  that patient of, you know, that's how it's thought of.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  Add it to the medication. If you want to prescribe the same  medication, you can just send that to the child.  So I'm just going to go ahead and get the focus right.  Can you please  show me on your end?  What am I showing you?  You can go ahead and prescribe, please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You can just type in Advil and do not prescribe.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  Yeah, try it for this one. It won't allow.  It will not allow to prescribe for this one because it does not have an address.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay. Let's find...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  Over there we can just type in testing do not prescribe so it will not go through.  But we just want to see exactly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  Okay, so the prescription has been queued.  Let's go ahead and check.  Alright.  So Brian, by the looks of it,  what I do understand is that  we need to go ahead and discuss this with our product development team<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  and see what exactly is going on.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  Do you have a ticket in regards to this?  Do you already have a ticket in regards to this?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No.  I was trying to get it solved immediately if we could.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  Okay. Alright. So we actually need to go ahead and get in touch with our product team.  I would need for you to go ahead and log a ticket, please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  Great.  Do you mind if I go ahead and type?  Sure. Go ahead. Thank you.  Fourteen, right?  Yes.  And just EPC is queued, right?  It's just saying EPC is queued.  Yeah.  Where is your... Kitty, please go ahead and open that tab up  where you're writing the ticket.  Uh, where'd it go?  Thank you.  And can you please type in your phone number?  Where are you?  Perfect. And what's the best time to give you a call?  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  Great.  Alrighty.  Perfect. I've noted down your ticket number, and I'm going to work with our product team.  We're going to get back to you.  So, yeah.  Entire practice.  Right. Right. So an ETA as product team has gone home for the day.  We're actually going to go ahead and give you a call right now to discuss in regards to this.  One of my associates is going to give you a call, but in regards of the  resolution, it's going to come to you  at the earliest tomorrow morning.  Thank you so much for your time.

Lagging, kicking people off?</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Well, so far no. Are you facing any trouble?  This has been happening since last week. And last week when we called, they said that we were not the only people calling.  They've received multiple calls. So this has been happening to us since last week.  And we need to figure out what is going on.  Okay. Would you be able to explain what is really happening?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Sure. When we go to, like, just now I was going into the schedule and the patient said his date of birth is wrong.  I said, I can fix that for you, sir. I went to registration, clicked on the date of birth and it's just spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning.  And then it says, aw snap, something went wrong.  So it says, would you like to wait or would you like to log off and go back in?  So we log off and we log back in and we do this all day long, every day. And it's crazy.  We see hundreds of patients a day. I understand that this was just a fluke and it was only happening for one day.  But it's been since last week now.

So you have to keep the patient holding while you log off, log back in, and then it seems to work fine for a few minutes.  And then it happens again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And if it's an issue with CureMD, we can't be the only one complaining about it.

It's really bad. They're only able to answer half the calls that they would normally answer because it's very, very slow.  And when it does, it just keeps spinning and you have to log out, log back in, and then you have to write the information down so you don't have to keep the patient holding.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  And it's happening with all of the users of the practice, not just one, right?</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Everyone.

Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Hi Neil. You know, this is Peggy from Premier Psychiatry, but I said, of course you're going to do it on any desk and now it's going to work fine.  This has been happening since last week Thursday. I can't believe you guys aren't getting bombarded with calls.  It cannot just be our practice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah. At the moment we haven't received like any sort of call in regards to snow and anything like that in the whole day of today, you know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah. Because it was happening last week and last week they said yes, they were getting some other calls with the same complaint so that the IT team was working on it.  So I was like, okay, no big deal. Just, you know, hopefully it'll get resolved, which was fine.  But now that we're done with the weekend, we're here on a Monday and it keeps happening.  But now I'm trying to go through the schedule and get it to happen for me. And it's not, of course.  I wish you guys could just remote in and watch it for a while, but it's not going to happen.  Okay. Peggy, one thing would really, yeah, one thing would really help us out, you know, like if like you could like whenever that happens, if you could like record that.  We did it last week. You guys were on an any desk and you recorded it and he said he was going to escalate it to the IT team and they were going to get it resolved.  I think it was Henry, I think. Jonathan or Henry. It's happening. Okay. Get a 301. Yeah. 725-050.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Okay, kindly put everything in the answer and you get a request. You're in? Yeah, I can see the screen. Okay. Yeah. And that's what's happening.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And all I did was go to the calendar, hit edit to see if the patient showed a balance or not right there. But then you get this wheel. <span style=""color:red""><b>  It happens about every I'd say you get to do like maybe five to seven tasks and then boom, this is going to happen</b></span>.  And then you have two options. You shut it down, go back in again, then you have another 10 minutes before it happens again.  So and we have operators overseas too that do remote. They work remotely for us and it's happening to them too.  They said they're not having any problems with any of the other programs, only care MD. And it's been since Thursday last week.  I wish it would be horrible how it seems to be going okay for you.  And then you get that message that says, oh snap, something went wrong. So you have no choice but to log out, log back in.  Do you have any care MD issues?  I have a patient.  He's looking and that's care MD on my computer. They're looking into fixing it now. What's the question?  The patient and I don't know.  The patient is 68 and she has to care for the brother's elderly wife or handicapped wife.  Okay. So she has an option then. She does have an out. Go back to Virginia. She has no friends in Virginia.  Then get a friend and go down. That's true. Friend will give her the money to get down there. Otherwise she's stuck in the position that she put herself in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  That's not anything we get for her sister-in-law. And now she is the only one who can get her out of it.  Okay. So Peggy, that blank care MD notification that pops up at the start of the call.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm so sorry. What did you say?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah. Like when you face like a slow prompt shows up like that blank care MD prompt that we faced at the start of the call.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Other than that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Well, yeah, you'll get the error, but it's not happening right now. It'll say, aw, snap, something went wrong. Log out and log back in.  But it's not happening. I can't get it to happen. Now this is delayed, but not that bad. At least it's working.  Now it's just a little slightly delayed, but it's not like it was.  No, it's working now. I guess the next time it happens, I could do screenshots for you. That's the best I can do, but they did record it last week.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  And he said, oh, I will, I'll escalate this to the IT team.  Okay. No worries.

So I have to take care of this.  I got to take care of the patient. I'm sorry. I'll see what I can do. If it happens again, I'll try to get you back on any desk.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Okay. No worries.

How can I help you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Hi Troy, this is Premier Psychiatry. Do you guys have any complaints about CureMD?  Lagging, kicking people off?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Well, so far no. Are you facing any trouble?  This has been happening since last week. And last week when we called, they said that we were not the only people calling.  They've received multiple calls. So this has been happening to us since last week.  And we need to figure out what is going on.  Okay. Would you be able to explain what is really happening?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Sure. When we go to, like, just now I was going into the schedule and the patient said his date of birth is wrong.  I said, I can fix that for you, sir. I went to registration, clicked on the date of birth and it's just spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning.  And then it says, aw snap, something went wrong.  So it says, would you like to wait or would you like to log off and go back in?  So we log off and we log back in and we do this all day long, every day. And it's crazy.  We see hundreds of patients a day. I understand that this was just a fluke and it was only happening for one day.  But it's been since last week now. And it's not just me. Like, now it's the other providers, it's the girls in the front, it's the gentleman in the front complaining.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  He keeps getting kicked off. We got patients sitting on the phone.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We're like, hold on one moment please. And it's just spinning. So you have to keep the patient holding while you log off, log back in, and then it seems to work fine for a few minutes.  And then it happens again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And if it's an issue with CureMD, we can't be the only one complaining about it.  And we have people that work overseas, we have remote operators and they're experiencing the same thing.  So it's not our internet because they said it's been happening Thursday, Friday and today.  It's really bad. They're only able to answer half the calls that they would normally answer because it's very, very slow.  And when it does, it just keeps spinning and you have to log out, log back in, and then you have to write the information down so you don't have to keep the patient holding.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  And it's happening with all of the users of the practice, not just one, right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Everyone.

Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Hi Neil. You know, this is Peggy from Premier Psychiatry, but I said, of course you're going to do it on any desk and now it's going to work fine.  This has been happening since last week Thursday. I can't believe you guys aren't getting bombarded with calls.  It cannot just be our practice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah. At the moment we haven't received like any sort of call in regards to snow and anything like that in the whole day of today, you know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah. Because it was happening last week and last week they said yes, they were getting some other calls with the same complaint so that the IT team was working on it.  So I was like, okay, no big deal. Just, you know, hopefully it'll get resolved, which was fine.  But now that we're done with the weekend, we're here on a Monday and it keeps happening.  But now I'm trying to go through the schedule and get it to happen for me. And it's not, of course.  I wish you guys could just remote in and watch it for a while, but it's not going to happen.  Okay. Peggy, one thing would really, yeah, one thing would really help us out, you know, like if like you could like whenever that happens, if you could like record that.  We did it last week. You guys were on an any desk and you recorded it and he said he was going to escalate it to the IT team and they were going to get it resolved.  I think it was Henry, I think. Jonathan or Henry. It's happening. Okay. Get a 301. Yeah. 725-050.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Okay, kindly put everything in the answer and you get a request. You're in? Yeah, I can see the screen. Okay. Yeah. And that's what's happening.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And all I did was go to the calendar, hit edit to see if the patient showed a balance or not right there. But then you get this wheel.  It happens about every I'd say you get to do like maybe five to seven tasks and then boom, this is going to happen.  And then you have two options. You shut it down, go back in again, then you have another 10 minutes before it happens again.  So and we have operators overseas too that do remote. They work remotely for us and it's happening to them too.  They said they're not having any problems with any of the other programs, only care MD. And it's been since Thursday last week.  I wish it would be horrible how it seems to be going okay for you.  And then you get that message that says, oh snap, something went wrong. So you have no choice but to log out, log back in.  Do you have any care MD issues?  I have a patient.  He's looking and that's care MD on my computer. They're looking into fixing it now. What's the question?  The patient and I don't know.  The patient is 68 and she has to care for the brother's elderly wife or handicapped wife.  Okay. So she has an option then. She does have an out. Go back to Virginia. She has no friends in Virginia.  Then get a friend and go down. That's true. Friend will give her the money to get down there. Otherwise she's stuck in the position that she put herself in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  That's not anything we get for her sister-in-law. And now she is the only one who can get her out of it.  Okay. So Peggy, that blank care MD notification that pops up at the start of the call.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm so sorry. What did you say?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah. Like when you face like a slow prompt shows up like that blank care MD prompt that we faced at the start of the call.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Other than that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Well, yeah, you'll get the error, but it's not happening right now. It'll say, aw, snap, something went wrong. Log out and log back in.  But it's not happening. I can't get it to happen. Now this is delayed, but not that bad. At least it's working.  Now it's just a little slightly delayed, but it's not like it was.  No, it's working now. I guess the next time it happens, I could do screenshots for you. That's the best I can do, but they did record it last week.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  And he said, oh, I will, I'll escalate this to the IT team.  Okay. No worries. Kindly bear with me just a minute.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You know, honey, I can't, I have a provider standing here and he's upset and his patient is crying.

But now I'm trying to go through the schedule and get it to happen for me. And it's not, of course.  I wish you guys could just remote in and watch it for a while, but it's not going to happen.  Okay. Peggy, one thing would really, yeah, one thing would really help us out, you know, like if like you could like whenever that happens, if you could like record that.  We did it last week. You guys were on an any desk and you recorded it and he said he was going to escalate it to the IT team and they were going to get it resolved.  I think it was Henry, I think. Jonathan or Henry. It's happening. Okay. Get a 301. Yeah. 725-050.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Okay, kindly put everything in the answer and you get a request. You're in? Yeah, I can see the screen. Okay. Yeah. And that's what's happening.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And all I did was go to the calendar, hit edit to see if the patient showed a balance or not right there. But then you get this wheel.  It happens about every I'd say you get to do like maybe five to seven tasks and then boom, this is going to happen.  And then you have two options. You shut it down, go back in again, then you have another 10 minutes before it happens again.  So and we have operators overseas too that do remote. They work remotely for us and it's happening to them too.  They said they're not having any problems with any of the other programs, only care MD. And it's been since Thursday last week.  I wish it would be horrible how it seems to be going okay for you.  And then you get that message that says, oh snap, something went wrong. So you have no choice but to log out, log back in.  Do you have any care MD issues?  I have a patient.  He's looking and that's care MD on my computer. They're looking into fixing it now. What's the question?  The patient and I don't know.  The patient is 68 and she has to care for the brother's elderly wife or handicapped wife.  Okay. So she has an option then. She does have an out. Go back to Virginia. She has no friends in Virginia.  Then get a friend and go down. That's true. Friend will give her the money to get down there. Otherwise she's stuck in the position that she put herself in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  That's not anything we get for her sister-in-law. And now she is the only one who can get her out of it.  Okay. So Peggy, that blank care MD notification that pops up at the start of the call.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm so sorry. What did you say?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah. Like when you face like a slow prompt shows up like that blank care MD prompt that we faced at the start of the call.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Other than that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Well, yeah, you'll get the error, but it's not happening right now. It'll say, aw, snap, something went wrong. Log out and log back in.  But it's not happening. I can't get it to happen. Now this is delayed, but not that bad. At least it's working.  Now it's just a little slightly delayed, but it's not like it was.  No, it's working now. I guess the next time it happens, I could do screenshots for you. That's the best I can do, but they did record it last week.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  And he said, oh, I will, I'll escalate this to the IT team.  Okay. No worries. Kindly bear with me just a minute.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You know, honey, I can't, I have a provider standing here and he's upset and his patient is crying. So I have to take care of this.  I got to take care of the patient. I'm sorry. I'll see what I can do. If it happens again, I'll try to get you back on any desk.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Okay. No worries. I really appreciate it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All right. I'm sorry. All right. Bye bye.<br>","<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Thank you so much for contacting CureMD. This is Troy. How can I help you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Hi Troy, this is Premier Psychiatry. Do you guys have any complaints about CureMD?  Lagging, kicking people off?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Well, so far no. Are you facing any trouble?  This has been happening since last week. And last week when we called, they said that we were not the only people calling.  They've received multiple calls. So this has been happening to us since last week.  And we need to figure out what is going on.  Okay. Would you be able to explain what is really happening?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Sure. When we go to, like, just now I was going into the schedule and the patient said his date of birth is wrong.  I said, I can fix that for you, sir. I went to registration, clicked on the date of birth and it's just spinning, spinning, spinning, spinning.  And then it says, aw snap, something went wrong.  So it says, would you like to wait or would you like to log off and go back in?  So we log off and we log back in and we do this all day long, every day. And it's crazy.  We see hundreds of patients a day. I understand that this was just a fluke and it was only happening for one day.  But it's been since last week now. And it's not just me. <span style=""color:red""><b> Like, now it's the other providers, it's the girls in the front, it's the gentleman in the front complaining</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  He keeps getting kicked off. We got patients sitting on the phone.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We're like, hold on one moment please. And it's just spinning. So you have to keep the patient holding while you log off, log back in, and then it seems to work fine for a few minutes.  And then it happens again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And if it's an issue with CureMD, we can't be the only one complaining about it.  And we have people that work overseas, we have remote operators and they're experiencing the same thing.  So it's not our internet because they said it's been happening Thursday, Friday and today.  It's really bad. They're only able to answer half the calls that they would normally answer because it's very, very slow.  And when it does, it just keeps spinning and you have to log out, log back in, and then you have to write the information down so you don't have to keep the patient holding.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  And it's happening with all of the users of the practice, not just one, right?</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Everyone. Everyone. Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I see. You know what? Let me check because previously Colin Nelson has worked with that.  Let me check with Colin and see what we can do about this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank you so much.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  No problem.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Stay connected.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Do you want to just call me back?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  If you can just stay connected.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That's fine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  It's just going to take a minute.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, sure.  Thank you.  Sure.  For now, just keep logging out and log back in when you get the messages, you guys.  Log out. Just hit the X.  Write what you need down. Hit the X and go back in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Thank you so much for your patience.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  All right. So actually we have someone from the IT team available who can look into this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  They should be able to resolve this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thanks.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  He's very good. It's Neil Banks.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  And he will just need to do any disk and see the behavior.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay. I'm ready. Do you want the number?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So I'm going to transfer you to Neil right now and you can give him the details.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  All right. Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Hi Neil. You know, this is Peggy from Premier Psychiatry, but I said, of course you're going to do it on any desk and now it's going to work fine.  This has been happening since last week Thursday. I can't believe you guys aren't getting bombarded with calls.  It cannot just be our practice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah.

My name is Ryan from CureMD Support. How may I help you today?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Hey Ryan, my name is Jeff Lauren and I am IT Administrator of a company called Flatirons Practice Management.  We do medical billing. <span style=""color:red""><b> We have just garnered information to log in as our customers site in order to manage their care or their practice billing</b></span>.  Unfortunately, the information that we see about going to cloud.curemd.com does not appear to be accurate. I can't even pull up cloud.curemd.com.  So what is the URL that I need in order to find it?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ryan Keller</span></b>:  Absolutely, sir. I look for that right away. I'm sorry about the inconvenience, first of all. Can I just have the practice system you're working for one more time, sir, if you wouldn't mind?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, hang on one second. Let me bring the manager in the call. Hang on. Hey, Stu, I've got CloudMD Support or CureMD Support on the phone.  What's the name of the practice again we're trying to get access to?  It is Goodness Health. Hold on.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ryan Keller</span></b>:  I believe I found that and good evening, ma'am. My name is Ryan from CureMD Support.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Hello.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ryan Keller</span></b>:  Hello, ma'am. So ma'am, guys, can you kindly try using this URL to see if it goes through? Just let me know whenever you're ready, sir.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Sure.  Yeah, the group is Goodness Health Group.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ryan Keller</span></b>:  Goodness Health Group. Thank you so much for that, ma'am. So I believe, if I'm not mistaken, yes, this should be the correct one we should be using.  So it starts off with the word login, sir, L-O-G-I-N, followed by the dot symbol, the period symbol in between, followed by CureMD, C-U-R-E-M-D dot net, sir. If you can please skip that and go.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Well, that looks better. Do we have a set of credentials you can try here? Let's see if that goes through.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ryan Keller</span></b>:  Yeah. So it was...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Watch out for the minor.  Oh, okay. So now I can read it.  We're getting a request to update the password, so I think that we're in.  Boy, it sure helped to make sure that you guys have updated documentation in your fax there because it sure led us astray.  As soon as it started talking about ActiveX, I was like, this can't possibly be the right place.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ryan Keller</span></b>:  Well, that was nothing at all, sir.

style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  i'm good i had a question for you real quick  joel ok this patient is cardi and it's going to be  two oh five  six six six nine<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  lane<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  but you see on his six twenty three visit there<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  uh... review the  that's the copy  uh... seventy five dollars<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  and that was applied against the uh...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  ultrasound called  nine three nine seven zero  okay but then if you look at his next date of service which was six twenty two  he doesn't have that so is it because of a new year so six twenty three six twenty  yeah because i was from last year<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh... and that could be possible that the patient has a new policy  uh...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  uh... this year and<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  if the patient believes that you know this shouldn't be applied to his visit  and this copy<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  then he can talk that is known we can be submitted a claim ok because he's not  happy about it  uh</b></span>... but i see  i'm thinking that it's just because of the new year yes that's correct  that makes two of us because  if i review i'm twenty twenty two<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh... and uh... whereas you see two of the appointments from this year one is<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  doctor or under doctor cindy  satith and that was<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  paid in the amount of forty nine zero two and then  same patient responsibility was applied seventy five dollars and which the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  patient paid<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh...  but for ultrasound  they applied the same responsibility again seventy five dollars<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  okay so because if you look at it like uh...  but so you're thinking that it's just because of the year change is that why is that a way  yes yes yes  yep ok ok so we were just trying to rest assured if the patient  believes that that was incorrectly billed  but with uh... <span style=""color:red""><b> blue cross blue shield and then if there's any substantial</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  or you know he can substantiate the claim that you know that needs to be<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  resubmitted of course we can ok uh... i've got one more let me see if i can pull it up  because i went through so many names  but this patient here  the insurance company called me here it is  two oh seven one seven four four<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  brenda mickle<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  and the insurance saying that her insurance called and said that she has  uh... united health dual and that she shouldn't have a bill period  united health mcr p p o was filed that's where it was filed at<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  now<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  when i went and looked up under her insurance companies they have the same policy number  okay uh...  primary is united health care dual complete<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  and there are two primary insurances one is the dual complete the other one is the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  health care<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  united health care mcr p p o  uh... i'm going to take the same policy<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  yeah i'm just going to take the eligibility to see if the patient has  dual plan  yeah it's dual complete</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  that's correct that's correct so in that case united health care normally  internally cross over the claim after processing as<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  the primary insurance claim to united health care secondary as the dual policy  patient but in this case i can see that the claim<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh... i will definitely see no and i will actually have that resubmitted to the secondary<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  and i'll confirm via email okay and then one more dave and we've already discussed this one  but uh... it's two oh six five one five seven we were trying to figure out if this was a  true credit of fourteen hundred fifty one thousand four hundred fifty one dollars and  nineteen cents  yeah she's thinking that we owe her forty five dollars and i'm saying uh... one thousand<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  four hundred fifty one dollars and nineteen cents<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  yes as far as we can do the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh... unapplied applied report of this patient and pull it up yes  yeah  and as far as we could see in the system you know that's a legit balance<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  uh... but why is it not showing where she paid and she didn't pay<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  so every time the whole thing<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  that's the thing<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  every time she was seen by the practice providers  for regardless for the ultrasound visit or for the doctor's visit blue cross blue shield  florida did not apply a penny to the patient's visit and i'm talking about from twenty twenty</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  two uh... november twenty twenty two all the way up to december twenty twenty two she has<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  one two three and four four visits and then again on october as i'm going down i can see  none of the patient responsibilities were transferred by previous appointment so that  was the only every time she paid like can you expand eight nineteen twenty twenty two  she paid three hundred twenty five and then that was allocated to unapplied and then again  eight twenty four it was moved to unapplied nine twenty seven whatever she paid nothing<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  was applied by the insurance so what date was that eight nineteen yes eight nineteen you can start  uh... from eight nineteen and you can go up but that's being paid by blue cross blue shield florida  that actually paid in the amount of five sixty one forty three all of that says blue cross blue shield<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  yeah all of the appointments are paid in full nothing was transferred to the patient  whereas the patient made uh... the payment at the time of service or later on she made a payment  for that appointment applied uh... to the outstanding balance since we did not have  any outstanding balance and then moved to the patient's unapplied balance but on the payee<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  i'm only seeing blue cross blue shield i'm not seeing where she actually paid anything  none of this says<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  jessica  fine coms bar coms you are correct<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  only two of them one forty five payment but everything else says blue cross blue shield  so why am i giving her fourteen hundred dollars back oh yes  just give me a moment  you're correct nikki  just give me a moment<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  have you got the report pulled up uh... the unapplied applied yeah i got it pulled up<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  and it shows that she  it says where they took it in advance but again i'm not seeing  where she paid  uh... do me a favor<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh... nikki can you just click on any date of service<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  i'm on ten twenty eight twenty two<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh... <span style=""color:red""><b> and then click on the option that says advances in allocation under that you see  allocate from unapplied  now these are all the payments received from the patient</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  okay i understand that dave  yeah but it's not reflected on the bill so i can't say this is a true  i can't even say that this is right  if it's not showing us where she paid  i see where it's saying she paid  but you gotta put that in there somewhere  that she paid just like they do that blue cross blue shield  that's correct  i'm not seeing that  yeah i'm gonna<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  open up the uh... applied and applied report as well and then<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  and applied and applied i got credit card payments totaling fifteen eighty<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  six and one thirty five of that fifteen eighty six was applied<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  and they're saying that i owe her fourteen fifty one nineteen but where is  her payments that she gave me fourteen hundred dollars i see it all day long on this paper  but it ain't in this system so is this whole thing wrong or what  that's just odd that's never not the case that's never the case if they make a payment  it always shows that they made a payment  yes you're correct<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  can you liz samaro nikki if that's possible  and<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  i'm sorry i should have figured out that<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  it's not showing on the payment page on the unapplied and applied report  correct if she made a payment that should have been displayed  yes<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  okay uh... so this one and the one before that you discussed<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  is gonna be with me and i'm gonna do my analysis before getting back to you and<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  i'll share my findings okay and i will call mister  in the meantime and tell him that this is because this is a new year has he met his  deductive that's what we're saying right<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  yes correct and still if he wants us to resubmit the claim he needs to have  someone on the line from the insurance and who can say that you know that was  incorrectly billed by by them and we need to not have the seventy five  dollar or any amount to pay then we can of course resubmit the claim okay<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  i'm going to call him now and tell him that okay wonderful alright thank you  nicky

going to be  two oh five  six six six nine<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  lane<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  but you see on his six twenty three visit there<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  uh... review the  that's the copy  uh... seventy five dollars<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  and that was applied against the uh...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  ultrasound called  nine three nine seven zero  okay but then if you look at his next date of service which was six twenty two  he doesn't have that so is it because of a new year so six twenty three six twenty  yeah because i was from last year<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh... and that could be possible that the patient has a new policy  uh...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  uh... this year and<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  if the patient believes that you know this shouldn't be applied to his visit  and this copy<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  then he can talk that is known we can be submitted a claim ok because he's not  happy about it  uh... but i see  i'm thinking that it's just because of the new year yes that's correct  that makes two of us because  if i review i'm twenty twenty two<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh... and uh... whereas you see two of the appointments from this year one is<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  doctor or under doctor cindy  satith and that was<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  paid in the amount of forty nine zero two and then  same patient responsibility was applied seventy five dollars and which the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  patient paid<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh...  but for ultrasound  they applied the same responsibility again seventy five dollars<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  okay so because if you look at it like uh...  but so you're thinking that it's just because of the year change is that why is that a way  yes yes yes  yep ok ok so we were just trying to rest assured if the patient  believes that that was incorrectly billed  but with uh... blue cross blue shield and then if there's any substantial<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  or you know he can substantiate the claim that you know that needs to be<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  resubmitted of course we can ok uh... i've got one more let me see if i can pull it up  because i went through so many names  but this patient here  the insurance company called me here it is  two oh seven one seven four four<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  brenda mickle<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  and the insurance saying that her insurance called and said that she has  uh... united health dual and that she shouldn't have a bill period  united health mcr p p o was filed that's where it was filed at<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  now<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  when i went and looked up under her insurance companies they have the same policy number  okay uh...  primary is united health care dual complete<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  and there are two primary insurances one is the dual complete the other one is the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  health care<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  united health care mcr p p o  uh... i'm going to take the same policy<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  yeah i'm just going to take the eligibility to see if the patient has  dual plan  yeah it's dual complete<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  that's correct that's correct so in that case united health care normally  internally cross over the claim after processing as<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  the primary insurance claim to united health care secondary as the dual policy  patient but in this case i can see that the claim<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh... i will definitely see no and i will actually have that resubmitted to the secondary<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  and i'll confirm via email okay and then one more dave and we've already discussed this one  but uh... it's two oh six five one five seven we were trying to figure out if this was a  true credit of fourteen hundred fifty one thousand four hundred fifty one dollars and  nineteen cents  yeah she's thinking that we owe her forty five dollars and i'm saying uh... one thousand<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  four hundred fifty one dollars and nineteen cents<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  yes as far as we can do the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh... unapplied applied report of this patient and pull it up yes  yeah  and as far as we could see in the system you know that's a legit balance<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  uh... but why is it not showing where she paid and she didn't pay<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  so every time the whole thing<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  that's the thing<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  every time she was seen by the practice providers  for regardless for the ultrasound visit or for the doctor's visit blue cross blue shield  florida did not apply a penny to the patient's visit and i'm talking about from twenty twenty<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  two uh... november twenty twenty two all the way up to december twenty twenty two she has<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  one two three and four four visits and then again on october as i'm going down i can see  none of the patient responsibilities were transferred by previous appointment so that  was the only every time she paid like can you expand eight nineteen twenty twenty two  she paid three hundred twenty five and then that was allocated to unapplied and then again  eight twenty four it was moved to unapplied nine twenty seven whatever she paid nothing<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  was applied by the insurance so what date was that eight nineteen yes eight nineteen you can start  uh... from eight nineteen and you can go up but that's being paid by blue cross blue shield florida  that actually paid in the amount of five sixty one forty three all of that says blue cross blue shield<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  yeah all of the appointments are paid in full nothing was transferred to the patient  whereas the patient made uh... the payment at the time of service or later on she made a payment  for that appointment applied uh... to the outstanding balance since we did not have  any outstanding balance and then moved to the patient's unapplied balance but on the payee<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  i'm only seeing blue cross blue shield i'm not seeing where she actually paid anything  none of this says<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  jessica  fine coms bar coms you are correct<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  only two of them one forty five payment but everything else says blue cross blue shield  so why am i giving her fourteen hundred dollars back oh yes  just give me a moment  you're correct nikki  just give me a moment<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  have you got the report pulled up uh... the unapplied applied yeah i got it pulled up<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  and it shows that she  it says where they took it in advance

he and let me just see if it's available though<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  when worship  emailer  which you want  she called back  and elena<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh... hi nicky i'm gonna come to a call today now okay<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  have a line of call you it's a little bit after no this is the first time i  hope you in between patient  panicky you're welcome  k day<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  hey how are you<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  i'm good i had a question for you real quick  joel ok this patient is cardi and it's going to be  two oh five  six six six nine<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  lane<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  but you see on his six twenty three visit there<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  uh... review the  that's the copy  uh... seventy five dollars<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  and that was applied against the uh...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  ultrasound called  nine three nine seven zero  okay but then if you look at his next date of service which was six twenty two  he doesn't have that so is it because of a new year so six twenty three six twenty  yeah because i was from last year<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh... and that could be possible that the patient has a new policy  uh...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  uh... this year and<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  if the patient believes that you know this shouldn't be applied to his visit  and this copy<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  then he can talk that is known we can be submitted a claim ok because he's not  happy about it  uh</b></span>... but i see  i'm thinking that it's just because of the new year yes that's correct  that makes two of us because  if i review i'm twenty twenty two<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh... and uh... whereas you see two of the appointments from this year one is<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  doctor or under doctor cindy  satith and that was<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  paid in the amount of forty nine zero two and then  same patient responsibility was applied seventy five dollars and which the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  patient paid<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh...  but for ultrasound  they applied the same responsibility again seventy five dollars<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  okay so because if you look at it like uh...  but so you're thinking that it's just because of the year change is that why is that a way  yes yes yes  yep ok ok so we were just trying to rest assured if the patient  believes that that was incorrectly billed  but with uh... blue cross blue shield and then if there's any substantial<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  or you know he can substantiate the claim that you know that needs to be<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  resubmitted of course we can ok uh... i've got one more let me see if i can pull it up  because i went through so many names  but this patient here  the insurance company called me here it is  two oh seven one seven four four<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  brenda mickle<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  and the insurance saying that her insurance called and said that she has  uh... united health dual and that she shouldn't have a bill period  united health mcr p p o was filed that's where it was filed at<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  now<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  when i went and looked up under her insurance companies they have the same policy number  okay uh...  primary is united health care dual complete<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  and there are two primary insurances one is the dual complete the other one is the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  health care<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  united health care mcr p p o  uh... i'm going to take the same policy<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  yeah i'm just going to take the eligibility to see if the patient has  dual plan  yeah it's dual complete<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  that's correct that's correct so in that case united health care normally  internally cross over the claim after processing as<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  the primary insurance claim to united health care secondary as the dual policy  patient but in this case i can see that the claim<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh... i will definitely see no and i will actually have that resubmitted to the secondary<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  and i'll confirm via email okay and then one more dave and we've already discussed this one  but uh... it's two oh six five one five seven we were trying to figure out if this was a  true credit of fourteen hundred fifty one thousand four hundred fifty one dollars and  nineteen cents  yeah she's thinking that we owe her forty five dollars and i'm saying uh... one thousand<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  four hundred fifty one dollars and nineteen cents<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  yes as far as we can do the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh... unapplied applied report of this patient and pull it up yes  yeah  and as far as we could see in the system you know that's a legit balance<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  uh... but why is it not showing where she paid and she didn't pay<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  so every time the whole thing<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  that's the thing<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  every time she was seen by the practice providers  for regardless for the ultrasound visit or for the doctor's visit blue cross blue shield  florida did not apply a penny to the patient's visit and i'm talking about from twenty twenty<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  two uh... november twenty twenty two all the way up to december twenty twenty two she has<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  one two three and four four visits and then again on october as i'm going down i can see  none of the patient responsibilities were transferred by previous appointment so that  was the only every time she paid like can you expand eight nineteen twenty twenty two  she paid three hundred twenty five and then that was allocated to unapplied and then again  eight twenty four it was moved to unapplied nine twenty seven whatever she paid nothing<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  was applied by the insurance so what date was that eight nineteen yes eight nineteen you can start  uh... from eight nineteen and you can go up but that's being paid by blue cross blue shield florida  that actually paid in the amount of five sixty one forty three all of that says blue cross blue shield<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  yeah all of the appointments are paid in full nothing was transferred to the patient  whereas the patient made uh... the payment at the time of service or later on she made a payment  for that appointment applied uh... to the outstanding balance since we did not have  any outstanding balance and then moved to the patient's unapplied balance but on the payee<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  i'm only seeing blue cross blue shield i'm not seeing where she actually paid anything  none of this says<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  jessica  fine coms bar coms you are correct<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  only two of them one forty five payment but everything else says blue cross blue shield  so why am i giving her fourteen hundred dollars back oh yes  just give me a moment  you're correct nikki  just give me a moment<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  have you got the report pulled up uh... the unapplied applied yeah i got it pulled up<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  and it shows that she  it says where they took it in advance but again i'm not seeing  where she paid  uh... do me a favor<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh... nikki can you just click on any date of service<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  i'm on ten twenty eight twenty two<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh... and then click on the option that says advances in allocation under that you see  allocate from unapplied  now these are all the payments received from the patient<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  okay i understand that dave  yeah but it's not reflected on the bill so i can't say this is a true  i can't even say that this is right  if it's not showing us where she paid  i see where it's saying she paid  but you gotta put that in there somewhere  that she paid just like they do that blue cross blue shield  that's correct  i'm not seeing that  yeah i'm gonna<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  open up the uh... applied and applied report as well and then<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  and applied and applied i got credit card payments totaling fifteen eighty<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  six and one thirty five of that fifteen eighty six was applied<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  and they're saying that i owe her fourteen fifty one nineteen but where is  her payments that she gave me fourteen hundred dollars i see it all day long on this paper  but it ain't in this system so is this whole thing wrong or what  that's just odd that's never not the case that's never the case if they make a payment  it always shows that they made a payment  yes you're correct<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  can you liz samaro nikki if that's possible  and<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  i'm sorry i should have figured out that<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  it's not showing on the payment page on the unapplied and applied report  correct if she made a payment that should have been displayed  yes<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  okay uh... so this one and the one before that you discussed<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  is gonna

Morris</span></b>:  paid in the amount of forty nine zero two and then  same patient responsibility was applied seventy five dollars and which the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  patient paid<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh...  but for ultrasound  they applied the same responsibility again seventy five dollars<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  okay so because if you look at it like uh...  but so you're thinking that it's just because of the year change is that why is that a way  yes yes yes  yep ok ok so we were just trying to rest assured if the patient  believes that that was incorrectly billed  but with uh... blue cross blue shield and then if there's any substantial<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  or you know he can substantiate the claim that you know that needs to be<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  resubmitted of course we can ok uh... i've got one more let me see if i can pull it up  because i went through so many names  but this patient here  the insurance company called me here it is  two oh seven one seven four four<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  brenda mickle<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  and the insurance saying that her insurance called and said that she has  uh... united health dual and that she shouldn't have a bill period  united health mcr p p o was filed that's where it was filed at<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  now<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  when i went and looked up under her insurance companies they have the same policy number  okay uh...  primary is united health care dual complete<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  and there are two primary insurances one is the dual complete the other one is the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  health care<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  united health care mcr p p o  uh... i'm going to take the same policy<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  yeah i'm just going to take the eligibility to see if the patient has  dual plan  yeah it's dual complete</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  that's correct that's correct so in that case united health care normally  internally cross over the claim after processing as<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  the primary insurance claim to united health care secondary as the dual policy  patient but in this case i can see that the claim<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh... i will definitely see no and i will actually have that resubmitted to the secondary<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  and i'll confirm via email okay and then one more dave and we've already discussed this one  but uh... it's two oh six five one five seven we were trying to figure out if this was a  true credit of fourteen hundred fifty one thousand four hundred fifty one dollars and  nineteen cents  yeah she's thinking that we owe her forty five dollars and i'm saying uh... one thousand<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  four hundred fifty one dollars and nineteen cents<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  yes as far as we can do the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh... unapplied applied report of this patient and pull it up yes  yeah  and as far as we could see in the system you know that's a legit balance<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  uh... but why is it not showing where she paid and she didn't pay<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  so every time the whole thing<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  that's the thing<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  every time she was seen by the practice providers  for regardless for the ultrasound visit or for the doctor's visit blue cross blue shield  florida did not apply a penny to the patient's visit and i'm talking about from twenty twenty<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  two uh... november twenty twenty two all the way up to december twenty twenty two she has<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  one two three and four four visits and then again on october as i'm going down i can see  none of the patient responsibilities were transferred by previous appointment so that  was the only every time she paid like can you expand eight nineteen twenty twenty two  she paid three hundred twenty five and then that was allocated to unapplied and then again  eight twenty four it was moved to unapplied nine twenty seven whatever she paid nothing<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  was applied by the insurance so what date was that eight nineteen yes eight nineteen you can start  uh... from eight nineteen and you can go up but that's being paid by blue cross blue shield florida  that actually paid in the amount of five sixty one forty three all of that says blue cross blue shield<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  yeah all of the appointments are paid in full nothing was transferred to the patient  whereas the patient made uh... the payment at the time of service or later on she made a payment  for that appointment applied uh... to the outstanding balance since we did not have  any outstanding balance and then moved to the patient's unapplied balance but on the payee<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  i'm only seeing blue cross blue shield i'm not seeing where she actually paid anything  none of this says<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  jessica  fine coms bar coms you are correct<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  only two of them one forty five payment but everything else says blue cross blue shield  so why am i giving her fourteen hundred dollars back oh yes  just give me a moment  you're correct nikki  just give me a moment<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  have you got the report pulled up uh... the unapplied applied yeah i got it pulled up<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  and it shows that she  it says where they took it in advance but again i'm not seeing  where she paid  uh... do me a favor<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh... nikki can you just click on any date of service<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  i'm on ten twenty eight twenty two<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  uh... and then click on the option that says advances in allocation under that you see  allocate from unapplied  now these are all the payments received from the patient<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  okay i understand that dave  yeah but it's not reflected on the bill so i can't say this is a true  i can't even say that this is right  if it's not showing us where she paid  i see where it's saying she paid  but you gotta put that in there somewhere  that she paid just like they do that blue cross blue shield  that's correct  i'm not seeing that  yeah i'm gonna<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  open up the uh... applied and applied report as well and then<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  and applied and applied i got credit card payments totaling fifteen eighty<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  six and one thirty five of that fifteen eighty six was applied<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  and they're saying that i owe her fourteen fifty one nineteen but where is  her payments that she gave me fourteen hundred dollars i see it all day long on this paper  but it ain't in this system so is this whole thing wrong or what  that's just odd that's never not the case that's never the case if they make a payment  it always shows that they made a payment  yes you're correct<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  can you liz samaro nikki if that's possible  and<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  i'm sorry i should have figured out that<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  it's not showing on the payment page on the unapplied and applied report  correct if she made a payment that should have been displayed  yes<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  okay uh... so this one and the one before that you discussed<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  is gonna be with me and i'm gonna do my analysis before getting back to you and<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  i'll share my findings okay and i will call mister  in the meantime and tell him that this is because this is a new year has he met his  deductive that's what we're saying right<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Drew Morris</span></b>:  yes correct and still if he wants us to resubmit the claim he needs to have  someone on the line from the insurance and who can say that you know that was  incorrectly billed by by them and we need to not have the seventy five  dollar or any amount to pay then we can of course resubmit the claim okay<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  i'm going to call him now and tell him that okay wonderful alright thank you  nicky you're welcome thank you bye bye<br>"

Well before it was like a few months ago it was a policy that in case if you're having  one or two forms then we don't charge.  Like if it's something that half an hour on RNR that is okay. <span style=""color:red""><b>  So these are four custom forms and for that we charge</b></span>.  Like if they're a very small task like a single custom form or a single node template then<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  we don't charge for that.  Yeah so we charge.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  Like as I told you that if we get if we are spending more time on the task right like  if we are spending more than an hour then it becomes a paid task.  Okay.  Like for these I've sent to explain you the breakdown that day it was 12 pages and it  takes around 3.5 hours like three and a half hours.  So and these are let me just open up the forums.  Okay so for these EDEQ sex forms these two forms are quite lengthy right.  Another one hypomania track pages and it will take around 40 minutes 45 minutes because  we have to type everything in because and custom forms are not like that we are typing  in a on a notepad or like in a word document.  Okay let me open up open up let me open up the other one the last one let's see if that<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  takes time.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  Okay so it's a word file it's a diagnostic screen for gambling problems right.  All right okay this can take all right this can be done in less than half an hour.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The screening would take more time you're saying?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  The hypomania scoring?  It's a lot of typing in there.  Have you seen the display of the custom forms where we create custom forms have you taken<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  a look at it?  How custom forms work.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  If you have the I can explain you how actually okay all right all right.  Like if you want me to create the gambling one and hypomania both?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Brian Shaw</span></b>:  Okay all right all right all right.

Yeah.  The thing is that while they were not able to acknowledge the result on their end, once  the result was assigned to them and was there on their dashboard, because while making the  assignment, after making the assignment, you actually acknowledge those results on your<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  end.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Tim Reed</span></b>:  So those results were acknowledged as a whole.

Well, thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So, actually I was calling you, locked in a support ticket about searching by tag option.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Yes, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Well, actually I just checked on my end and I was able to locate it.  Can I connect via any disk?  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  The number is 425-383-915.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Alright, sending a request.  Alright, do you mind if I take control?  Mm-hmm.  So, the supports in patient scroll down a little and this tag name is the option in  which you can search a patient by tag.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, okay, great.  So, I did not see that tag name here that I was looking for though, because it said  it's under profile.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  It went under profile and I couldn't find anything under this area and that video picture  you all had, it would just stand right in here, it was like right here and I couldn't<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  see it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, this tag name is over here, tag tag.  So, can you help me with, like if I want to add a tag to a patient and create tags, so  creating or adding tags, where do I go for the tags?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I go to settings.  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I go to the R and I go to the tags and I'll go to global.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Then, so if I want to remove these two tags because we're done with them.  Okay.  Or one of them, this one I want to remove.  Okay.  So, if I click on it, how do I delete it?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So, you can delete it from selecting.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  It won't get me, it doesn't let me, see, it's grey.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  It does not select both, okay, let me check.  Is it because it's associated with some of the patient's name?  I believe so.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Because you already have some patient, okay, so they're not removable as long as they're<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  associated with the patient.  Exactly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I cannot delete that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  This logo means that they're associated with the patient, one or multiple, so that's probably  the reason.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  And if I want to add, so the tag, because there's two, so the tag is the tag name, description,  the tag type.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, tag type is how do I add more options of the tag type?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Sure, of course.  So, you see this plus option.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Oh yeah, the plus one, yeah.  And it will be added.  Okay, so the tag type, let me see, so they can be clinical trial, patient assault.  If I want to remove the test one, I can remove this, yes.  So, clinical trial, we don't want to do patient, we want to, it won't let me do them.  Default tag cannot be in, this is the default one.  So, if I want to add, yeah, the tag is full.  Tag type is just a category, is that right?  Yes.  Okay, so for example, if it's a tag in regard to insurance, then I just.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  First, you have to press here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, so now the tag for the insurance has been added.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Exactly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, so if I want to create a different tag, and I would just say Kelsey, you know, Kelsey  Cebo, Kelsey Cebo, and then the description is, we don't need, it's not a bad date to  grab, but it's insurance type, and I want to, you know, do it as an orange color.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, then if I go to a patient, and for example, we would go to one of the patients today is  full of insurance, and I go to here, and so if I want to add a tag, and I just go over<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  here, and then.  Exactly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  And it would show up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  And I can add a lot of them, is that right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah, exactly, you can add more than one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, and then if I want to go search, I can just go ahead and just tag it with, just search  by the tag.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Well, there's another option actually, there's another workflow for that.  So, one is that we can go and report, right, but that's actually a little longer than this<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So, you go in patient, in advanced, here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Oh, you have it there too, that's great, that's great.  So, you have a tag search on the patient search area.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So, you click, select this, and then search, and you'll see all the patients with this<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  tag.  Okay, very good.  And that's all I wanted to know, to know how to do the tag, where to look for it, and where  to search the patient has to add those tags, and also I didn't know what the difference  between the tag and type, and then the tag myself.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  All right, all right, perfect, Dr. Abbasi, is there anything else?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Yeah, there were a couple of more tickets that I created.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Oh, yes, actually.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Go look into that one, let me see, I'll tell you from the other side.

But, uh, see yours has a very long one, uh, that, uh, these are my few ones that I made  like a long time ago.  Oh, okay.  I got it.  Uh, so let me check where they are.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Just a second.  Yeah, where they are.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  But that would be good for me to look and then start using them as we, you know, uh,  uh, uh, take, you know, action for them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So that would be great to know.  Perfect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  My assessment is in the progress notes of the patient, and, uh, we just, whenever we  create a note into the patient, we can just go ahead to the assessment and then, um, uh,  be able to add whatever we need to, like, you know</b></span>.  Yeah, that's correct, doctor.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Okay, so, um, was there any other tickets?  Uh, yes, uh, there's another ticket about referral, but I need to get some information  on it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  That's why that, uh, you said you read that into the release notes that the referral reason  have a drop.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  If you go to the release notes, you want me to show you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  If you can, that would be great, doctor.  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah, it's in the release notes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay.  And it says over here, uh, let's see, this is for the, let's see, ability to be sure  if I'm missing the peers tag, option to record travel history, option to be selected multiple<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  smoking times, the referral reason.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  That's it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I see, doctor.  I, as I can see that perfectly, that's fine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I will get back to you on this one and the, about the assessment one, I would let you  know where our, uh, generic assessment forms are sitting so you can have a look at them  as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Oh yeah.  Thank you so much for your help.  Okay, bye.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  No problem.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Thank you.<br>","Diagnosis, Billing Invoice, EDI PM, Provider Notes","<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Dr. Abbasi, this is Avasami, how may I help you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Speak with Dr. Abbasi.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Speaking, yes.  Well, thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So, actually I was calling you, locked in a support ticket about searching by tag option.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Yes, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Well, actually I just checked on my end and I was able to locate it.  Can I connect via any disk?  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  The number is 425-383-915.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Alright, sending a request.  Alright, do you mind if I take control?  Mm-hmm.  So, the supports in patient scroll down a little and this tag name is the option in  which you can search a patient by tag.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, okay, great.  So, I did not see that tag name here that I was looking for though, because it said  it's under profile.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  It went under profile and I couldn't find anything under this area and that video picture  you all had, it would just stand right in here, it was like right here and I couldn't<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  see it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, this tag name is over here, tag tag.  So, can you help me with, like if I want to add a tag to a patient and create tags, so  creating or adding tags, where do I go for the tags?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I go to settings.  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I go to the R and I go to the tags and I'll go to global.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Then, so if I want to remove these two tags because we're done with them.  Okay.  Or one of them, this one I want to remove.  Okay.  So, if I click on it, how do I delete it?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So, you can delete it from selecting.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  It won't get me, it doesn't let me, see, it's grey.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  It does not select both, okay, let me check.  Is it because it's associated with some of the patient's name?  I believe so.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Because you already have some patient, okay, so they're not removable as long as they're<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  associated with the patient.  Exactly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I cannot delete that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  This logo means that they're associated with the patient, one or multiple, so that's probably  the reason.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  And if I want to add, so the tag, because there's two, so the tag is the tag name, description,  the tag type.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, tag type is how do I add more options of the tag type?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Sure, of course.  So, you see this plus option.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Oh yeah, the plus one, yeah.  And it will be added.  Okay, so the tag type, let me see, so they can be clinical trial, patient assault.  If I want to remove the test one, I can remove this, yes.  So, clinical trial, we don't want to do patient, we want to, it won't let me do them.  Default tag cannot be in, this is the default one.  So, if I want to add, yeah, the tag is full.  Tag type is just a category, is that right?  Yes.  Okay, so for example, if it's a tag in regard to insurance, then I just.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  First, you have to press here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, so now the tag for the insurance has been added.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Exactly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, so if I want to create a different tag, and I would just say Kelsey, you know, Kelsey  Cebo, Kelsey Cebo, and then the description is, we don't need, it's not a bad date to  grab, but it's insurance type, and I want to, you know, do it as an orange color.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, then if I go to a patient, and for example, we would go to one of the patients today is  full of insurance, and I go to here, and so if I want to add a tag, and I just go over<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  here, and then.  Exactly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  And it would show up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  And I can add a lot of them, is that right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah, exactly, you can add more than one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, and then if I want to go search, I can just go ahead and just tag it with, just search  by the tag.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Well, there's another option actually, there's another workflow for that.  So, one is that we can go and report, right, but that's actually a little longer than this<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So, you go in patient, in advanced, here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Oh, you have it there too, that's great, that's great.  So, you have a tag search on the patient search area.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So, you click, select this, and then search, and you'll see all the patients with this<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  tag.  Okay, very good.  And that's all I wanted to know, to know how to do the tag, where to look for it, and where  to search the patient has to add those tags, and also I didn't know what the difference  between the tag and type, and then the tag myself.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  All right, all right, perfect, Dr. Abbasi, is there anything else?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Yeah, there were a couple of more tickets that I created.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Oh, yes, actually.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Go look into that one, let me see, I'll tell you from the other side.  Hello?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I'm not the person that you should tag, tell you back, but no, you will be calling the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  wrong person.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  No problem, actually Tyler was sitting with me, and I think he has one of the tickets,  so I'm going to transfer you to him, okay?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  You're welcome.

Sure, so my number for any desk is 425-383-915.  Alright, so you should see a permission on your side to accept.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Brilliant, I can see your screen.

Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah, it's in the release notes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay.  And it says over here, uh, let's see, this is for the, let's see, ability to be sure  if I'm missing the peers tag, option to record travel history, option to be selected multiple<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  smoking times, the referral reason.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  That's it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I see, doctor.  I, as I can see that perfectly, that's fine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I will get back to you on this one and the, about the assessment one, I would let you  know where our, uh, generic assessment forms are sitting so you can have a look at them  as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Oh yeah.  Thank you so much for your help.  Okay, bye.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  No problem.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Thank you.<br>",,,,,,,"<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Dr. Abbasi, this is Avasami, how may I help you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Speak with Dr. Abbasi.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Speaking, yes.  Well, thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So, actually I was calling you, locked in a support ticket about searching by tag option.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Yes, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Well, actually I just checked on my end and I was able to locate it.  Can I connect via any disk?  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  The number is 425-383-915.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Alright, sending a request.  Alright, do you mind if I take control?  Mm-hmm.  So, the supports in patient scroll down a little and this tag name is the option in  which you can search a patient by tag.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, okay, great.  So, I did not see that tag name here that I was looking for though, because it said  it's under profile.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  It went under profile and I couldn't find anything under this area and that video picture  you all had, it would just stand right in here, it was like right here and I couldn't<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  see it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, this tag name is over here, tag tag.  So, can you help me with, like if I want to add a tag to a patient and create tags, so  creating or adding tags, where do I go for the tags?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I go to settings.  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I go to the R and I go to the tags and I'll go to global.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Then, so if I want to remove these two tags because we're done with them.  Okay.  Or one of them, this one I want to remove.  Okay.  So, if I click on it, how do I delete it?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So, you can delete it from selecting.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  It won't get me, it doesn't let me, see, it's grey.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  It does not select both, okay, let me check.  Is it because it's associated with some of the patient's name?  I believe so.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Because you already have some patient, okay, so they're not removable as long as they're<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  associated with the patient.  Exactly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I cannot delete that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  This logo means that they're associated with the patient, one or multiple, so that's probably  the reason.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  And if I want to add, so the tag, because there's two, so the tag is the tag name, description,  the tag type.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, tag type is how do I add more options of the tag type?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Sure, of course.  So, you see this plus option.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Oh yeah, the plus one, yeah.  And it will be added.  Okay, so the tag type, let me see, so they can be clinical trial, patient assault.  If I want to remove the test one, I can remove this, yes.  So, clinical trial, we don't want to do patient, we want to, it won't let me do them.  Default tag cannot be in, this is the default one.  So, if I want to add, yeah, the tag is full.  Tag type is just a category, is that right?  Yes.  Okay, so for example, if it's a tag in regard to insurance, then I just.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  First, you have to press here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, so now the tag for the insurance has been added.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Exactly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, so if I want to create a different tag, and I would just say Kelsey, you know, Kelsey  Cebo, Kelsey Cebo, and then the description is, we don't need, it's not a bad date to  grab, but it's insurance type, and I want to, you know, do it as an orange color.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, then if I go to a patient, and for example, we would go to one of the patients today is  full of insurance, and I go to here, and so if I want to add a tag, and I just go over<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  here, and then.  Exactly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  And it would show up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  And I can add a lot of them, is that right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah, exactly, you can add more than one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, and then if I want to go search, I can just go ahead and just tag it with, just search  by the tag.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Well, there's another option actually, there's another workflow for that.  So, one is that we can go and report, right, but that's actually a little longer than this<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So, you go in patient, in advanced, here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Oh, you have it there too, that's great, that's great.  So, you have a tag search on the patient search area.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So, you click, select this, and then search, and you'll see all the patients with this<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  tag.  Okay, very good.  And that's all I wanted to know, to know how to do the tag, where to look for it, and where  to search the patient has to add those tags, and also I didn't know what the difference  between the tag and type, and then the tag myself.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  All right, all right, perfect, Dr. Abbasi, is there anything else?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Yeah, there were a couple of more tickets that I created.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Oh, yes, actually.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Go look into that one, let me see, I'll tell you from the other side.  Hello?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I'm not the person that you should tag, tell you back, but no, you will be calling the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  wrong person.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  No problem, actually Tyler was sitting with me, and I think he has one of the tickets,  so I'm going to transfer you to him, okay?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  You're welcome.  Hello, hi, this is Tyler from Q&A.  Yes, hi, how are you doing?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I'm good, thank you, doctor.  I actually wanted to know, I have two of your tickets, one of them is about the referral  reason it's not populating, and the second one is about the assessment forms that you<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  are not able to access.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, I checked your permissions, everything seems normal, so I thought, okay, let's have  a screen share session with you so I can see what exactly is happening at your end.  Sure, so my number for any desk is 425-383-915.  Alright, so you should see a permission on your side to accept.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Brilliant, I can see your screen.  So, if you can show me what exactly is happening at your end.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, if I go here, and then go to the referral, and then, so for example, we want to create<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  a new outgoing one.  So, you just click on this blue button, new outgoing referral.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, then, referral reason, you all have like a add a dropdown that we can select what are  the referral reasons, and ours does not have that dropdown that we can add our usual referral  reasons.  So, you're saying you, have you seen this on someone else's computer that they get a<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  menu from here?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Yeah, yeah, the new features that you already have is that instead of typing it, we now  have it as a dropdown, and then you can select your referral reason.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Doctor, I will get back to you on this, no problem at all, and also if you could show  me about the assessment forms that you are not able to access.  The assessment forms, so that was on the, let's see, give me some example of what did  I say exactly on to that.  So, on the, yeah, I'll tell you, you said under clinical, we do not have the option  of assessment form and unable to access the assessment forms.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah, and so.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  So, you would have, so you would have to go to provider notes in all the assessment forms,  and they are right here, assessment</b></span>.  So, you click on it, and from here, you can go ahead if you want to add one, you can select  from this list, and then once you select one, you will be able to use it and make any changes<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  and save it on the patient's chart.  Oh, hold on one second, let me just learn the pattern.  So, you went to the patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Provider note.  You go to the, you have to go to the provider note.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Mm-hmm.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  And the provider note.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Once you open one.  We select, yeah, we select the note.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  And if you scroll down all the way, you would see assessment forms.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  There we go, it's right here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, on the assessment form, so these are the, and then I press add onto the assessment,  then I can.  Yeah, you click on the add button.  Click the add button, okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  And here are the questionnaires.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, we can select our, like for example, the patient is screening the ECOG, I think it  had the ECOG too, ECOG.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So, let's see if we can do the ECOG here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Then save it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So, I want to see how, what is it, then ICX.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, so this showed up here.  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  But I can move it, you know.  Of course.  Yeah.  So, this is sorted, right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, the other question I have is that I want to know how I can add different type of assessment<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  forms in here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, you have pre-populated ones.  Yep.  Okay.  And so, they are based on category, let's see, oncology, with oncology performance,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  let me see all of the oncology ones.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  You only have the ECOG?  Yep.  Is there any other, if I want to add something, can I add it here?  So, if you want to add any of them, you just have to share that template with us and we  will add that into the system for you.  Okay, so if some, assessment, so you want to do test, so these are some of the usual  ones.  And I can go, where can I see all of this list?  So, you just want.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Where are they in the setting?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So yeah, most probably they will be under settings, but let's try, because I've never  tried to access them, but I'm sure they will be under settings.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I'm just going to close this one.  Do you want to save this provider note?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  No, no, no.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Okay, no problem then.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, so let's, I shouldn't be here.  It should be under EHR, uh, questionnaire.  You can put assessment, and do you want the email, are you going to want, yeah, you want  me to do the change password one?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  No, really.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  For the 10 minutes, that's a bar, so it needs to, yeah, quite often.  Yeah, those are not it, but you guys have like a big list of downloads.  Sorry, here you have all the, um, assessment plans.  No, no, that's not it.  No, these are mine, these are mine.  But, uh, see yours has a very long one, uh, that, uh, these are my few ones that I made  like a long time ago.  Oh, okay.  I got it.  Uh, so let me check where they are.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Just a second.  Yeah, where they are.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  But that would be good for me to look and then start using them as we, you know, uh,  uh, uh, take, you know, action for them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So that would be great to know.  Perfect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  My assessment is in the progress notes of the patient, and, uh, we just, whenever we  create a note into the patient, we can just go ahead to the assessment and then, um, uh,  be able to add whatever we need to, like, you know</b></span>.  Yeah, that's correct, doctor.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Okay, so, um, was there any other tickets?  Uh, yes, uh, there's another ticket about referral, but I need to get some information  on it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  That's why that, uh, you said you read that into the release notes that the referral reason  have a drop.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  If you go to the release notes, you want me to show you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  If you can, that would be great, doctor.  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah, it's in the release notes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay.  And it says over here, uh, let's see, this is for the, let's see, ability to be sure  if I'm missing the peers tag, option to record travel history, option to be selected multiple<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  smoking times, the referral reason.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  That's it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I see, doctor.  I, as I can see that perfectly, that's fine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I will get back to you on this one and the, about the assessment one, I would let you  know where our, uh, generic assessment forms are sitting so you can have a look at them  as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Oh yeah.

Exactly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  And it would show up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  And I can add a lot of them, is that right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah, exactly, you can add more than one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, and then if I want to go search, I can just go ahead and just tag it with, just search  by the tag.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Well, there's another option actually, there's another workflow for that.  So, one is that we can go and report, right, but that's actually a little longer than this<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So, you go in patient, in advanced, here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Oh, you have it there too, that's great, that's great.  So, you have a tag search on the patient search area.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So, you click, select this, and then search, and you'll see all the patients with this<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  tag.  Okay, very good.  And that's all I wanted to know, to know how to do the tag, where to look for it, and where  to search the patient has to add those tags, and also I didn't know what the difference  between the tag and type, and then the tag myself.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  All right, all right, perfect, Dr. Abbasi, is there anything else?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Yeah, there were a couple of more tickets that I created.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Oh, yes, actually.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Go look into that one, let me see, I'll tell you from the other side.  Hello?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I'm not the person that you should tag, tell you back, but no, you will be calling the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  wrong person.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  No problem, actually Tyler was sitting with me, and I think he has one of the tickets,  so I'm going to transfer you to him, okay?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  You're welcome.  Hello, hi, this is Tyler from Q&A.  Yes, hi, how are you doing?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I'm good, thank you, doctor.  I actually wanted to know, I have two of your tickets, one of them is about the referral  reason it's not populating, and the second one is about the assessment forms that you<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  are not able to access.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, I checked your permissions, everything seems normal, so I thought, okay, let's have  a screen share session with you so I can see what exactly is happening at your end.  Sure, so my number for any desk is 425-383-915.  Alright, so you should see a permission on your side to accept.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Brilliant, I can see your screen.  So, if you can show me what exactly is happening at your end.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, if I go here, and then go to the referral, and then, so for example, we want to create<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  a new outgoing one.  So, you just click on this blue button, new outgoing referral.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, then, referral reason, you all have like a add a dropdown that we can select what are  the referral reasons, and ours does not have that dropdown that we can add our usual referral  reasons.  So, you're saying you, have you seen this on someone else's computer that they get a<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  menu from here?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Yeah, yeah, the new features that you already have is that instead of typing it, we now  have it as a dropdown, and then you can select your referral reason.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Doctor, I will get back to you on this, no problem at all, and also if you could show  me about the assessment forms that you are not able to access.  The assessment forms, so that was on the, let's see, give me some example of what did  I say exactly on to that.  So, on the, yeah, I'll tell you, you said under clinical, we do not have the option  of assessment form and unable to access the assessment forms.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah, and so.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, you would have, so you would have to go to provider notes in all the assessment forms,  and they are right here, assessment.  So, you click on it, and from here, you can go ahead if you want to add one, you can select  from this list, and then once you select one, you will be able to use it and make any changes<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  and save it on the patient's chart.  Oh, hold on one second, let me just learn the pattern.  So, you went to the patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Provider note.  You go to the, you have to go to the provider note.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Mm-hmm.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  And the provider note.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Once you open one.  We select, yeah, we select the note.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  And if you scroll down all the way, you would see assessment forms.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  There we go, it's right here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, on the assessment form, so these are the, and then I press add onto the assessment,  then I can.  Yeah, you click on the add button.  Click the add button, okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  And here are the questionnaires.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, we can select our, like for example, the patient is screening the ECOG, I think it  had the ECOG too, ECOG.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So, let's see if we can do the ECOG here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Then save it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So, I want to see how, what is it, then ICX.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, so this showed up here.  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  But I can move it, you know.  Of course.  Yeah.  So, this is sorted, right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, the other question I have is that I want to know how I can add different type of assessment<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  forms in here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, you have pre-populated ones.  Yep.  Okay.  And so, they are based on category, let's see, oncology, with oncology performance,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  let me see all of the oncology ones.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  You only have the ECOG?  Yep.  Is there any other, if I want to add something, can I add it here?  So, if you want to add any of them, you just have to share that template with us and we  will add that into the system for you.  Okay, so if some, assessment, so you want to do test, so these are some of the usual  ones.  And I can go, where can I see all of this list?  So, you just want.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Where are they in the setting?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So yeah, most probably they will be under settings, but let's try, because I've never  tried to access them, but I'm sure they will be under settings.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I'm just going to close this one.  Do you want to save this provider note?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  No, no, no.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Okay, no problem then.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, so let's, I shouldn't be here.  It should be under EHR, uh, questionnaire. <span style=""color:red""><b>  You can put assessment, and do you want the email, are you going to want, yeah, you want  me to do the change password one?</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  No, really.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  For the 10 minutes, that's a bar, so it needs to, yeah, quite often.  Yeah, those are not it, but you guys have like a big list of downloads.  Sorry, here you have all the, um, assessment plans.  No, no, that's not it.  No, these are mine, these are mine.  But, uh, see yours has a very long one, uh, that, uh, these are my few ones that I made  like a long time ago.  Oh, okay.  I got it.  Uh, so let me check where they are.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Just a second.  Yeah, where they are.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  But that would be good for me to look and then start using them as we, you know, uh,  uh, uh, take, you know, action for them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So that would be great to know.  Perfect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  My assessment is in the progress notes of the patient, and, uh, we just, whenever we  create a note into the patient, we can just go ahead to the assessment and then, um, uh,  be able to add whatever we need to, like, you know.  Yeah, that's correct, doctor.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Okay, so, um, was there any other tickets?  Uh, yes, uh, there's another ticket about referral, but I need to get some information  on it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  That's why that, uh, you said you read that into the release notes that the referral reason  have a drop.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  If you go to the release notes, you want me to show you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  If you can, that would be great, doctor.  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah, it's in the release notes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay.  And it says over here, uh, let's see, this is for the, let's see, ability to be sure  if I'm missing the peers tag, option to record travel history, option to be selected multiple<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  smoking times, the referral reason.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  That's it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I see, doctor.  I, as I can see that perfectly, that's fine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I will get back to you on this one and the, about the assessment one, I would let you  know where our, uh, generic assessment forms are sitting so you can have a look at them  as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Oh yeah.  Thank you so much for your help.  Okay, bye.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  No problem.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Thank you.<br>","<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Dr. Abbasi, this is Avasami, how may I help you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Speak with Dr. Abbasi.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Speaking, yes.  Well, thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So, actually I was calling you, locked in a support ticket about searching by tag option.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Yes, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Well, actually I just checked on my end and I was able to locate it.  Can I connect via any disk?  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  The number is 425-383-915.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Alright, sending a request.  Alright, do you mind if I take control?  Mm-hmm.  So, the supports in patient scroll down a little and this tag name is the option in  which you can search a patient by tag.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, okay, great.  So, I did not see that tag name here that I was looking for though, because it said  it's under profile.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  It went under profile and I couldn't find anything under this area and that video picture  you all had, it would just stand right in here, it was like right here and I couldn't<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  see it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, this tag name is over here, tag tag.  So, can you help me with, like if I want to add a tag to a patient and create tags, so  creating or adding tags, where do I go for the tags?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I go to settings.  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I go to the R and I go to the tags and I'll go to global.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Then, so if I want to remove these two tags because we're done with them.  Okay.  Or one of them, this one I want to remove.  Okay.  So, if I click on it, how do I delete it?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So, you can delete it from selecting.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  It won't get me, it doesn't let me, see, it's grey.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  It does not select both, okay, let me check.  Is it because it's associated with some of the patient's name?  I believe so.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Because you already have some patient, okay, so they're not removable as long as they're<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  associated with the patient.  Exactly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I cannot delete that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  This logo means that they're associated with the patient, one or multiple, so that's probably  the reason.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  And if I want to add, so the tag, because there's two, so the tag is the tag name, description,  the tag type.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, tag type is how do I add more options of the tag type?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Sure, of course.  So, you see this plus option.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Oh yeah, the plus one, yeah.  And it will be added.  Okay, so the tag type, let me see, so they can be clinical trial, patient assault.  If I want to remove the test one, I can remove this, yes.  So, clinical trial, we don't want to do patient, we want to, it won't let me do them.  Default tag cannot be in, this is the default one.  So, if I want to add, yeah, the tag is full.  Tag type is just a category, is that right?  Yes.  Okay, so for example, if it's a tag in regard to insurance, then I just.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  First, you have to press here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, so now the tag for the insurance has been added.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Exactly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, so if I want to create a different tag, and I would just say Kelsey, you know, Kelsey  Cebo, Kelsey Cebo, and then the description is, we don't need, it's not a bad date to  grab, but it's insurance type, and I want to, you know, do it as an orange color.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So, then if I go to a patient, and for example, we would go to one of the patients today is  full of insurance, and I go to here, and so if I want to add a tag, and I just go over<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  here, and then.  Exactly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  And it would show up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  And I can add a lot of them, is that right?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Yeah, exactly, you can add more than one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, and then if I want to go search, I can just go ahead and just tag it with, just search  by the tag.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Well, there's another option actually, there's another workflow for that.  So, one is that we can go and report, right, but that's actually a little longer than this<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So, you go in patient, in advanced, here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Oh, you have it there too, that's great, that's great.  So, you have a tag search on the patient search area.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So, you click, select this, and then search, and you'll see all the patients with this<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  tag.  Okay, very good.  And that's all I wanted to know, to know how to do the tag, where to look for it, and where  to search the patient has to add those tags, and also I didn't know what the difference  between the tag and type, and then the tag myself.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  All right, all right, perfect, Dr. Abbasi, is there anything else?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Yeah, there were a couple of more tickets that I created.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Oh, yes, actually.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Go look into that one, let me see, I'll tell you from the other side.  Hello?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  I'm not the person that you should tag, tell you back, but no, you will be calling the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  wrong person.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  No problem, actually Tyler was sitting with me, and I think he has one of the tickets,  so I'm going to transfer you to him, okay?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  You're welcome.

Yep.  Is there any other, if I want to add something, can I add it here?  So, if you want to add any of them, you just have to share that template with us and we  will add that into the system for you.  Okay, so if some, assessment, so you want to do test, so these are some of the usual  ones.  And I can go, where can I see all of this list?  So, you just want.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Where are they in the setting?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  So yeah, most probably they will be under settings, but let's try, because I've never  tried to access them, but I'm sure they will be under settings.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  I'm just going to close this one.  Do you want to save this provider note?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  No, no, no.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Okay, no problem then.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  Okay, so let's, I shouldn't be here.  It should be under EHR, uh, questionnaire.  You can put assessment, and do you want the email, are you going to want, yeah, you want  me to do the change password one?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  No, really.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  For the 10 minutes, that's a bar, so it needs to, yeah, quite often.  Yeah, those are not it, but you guys have like a big list of downloads.  Sorry, here you have all the, um, assessment plans.  No, no, that's not it.  No, these are mine, these are mine.  But, uh, see yours has a very long one, uh, that, uh, these are my few ones that I made  like a long time ago.  Oh, okay.  I got it.  Uh, so let me check where they are.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Just a second.  Yeah, where they are.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  But that would be good for me to look and then start using them as we, you know, uh,  uh, uh, take, you know, action for them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  So that would be great to know.  Perfect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  My assessment is in the progress notes of the patient, and, uh, we just, whenever we  create a note into the patient, we can just go ahead to the assessment and then, um, uh,  be able to add whatever we need to, like, you know.  Yeah, that's correct, doctor.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  Okay, so, um, was there any other tickets?  Uh, yes, uh, there's another ticket about referral, but I need to get some information  on it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  That's why that, uh, you said you read that into the release notes that the referral reason  have a drop.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Troy Mason</span></b>:  If you go to the release notes, you want me to show you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">North Houston Cancer Clinics</span></b>:  If you can, that would be great, doctor.

And which insurance do you have?  And?  I don't think she was...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Stella Adams</span></b>:  I'm talking about secondary insurance.  We have Medicaid at secondary.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think Medicaid should be the first one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Stella Adams</span></b>:  Medicare is the primary, and Medicaid is the secondary.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And you...

I don't know what you need.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Stella Adams</span></b>:  That's what I explained earlier.

Good morning, everyone.  I'm not sure if Erin, can you hear me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I can hear you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, that's good.  So do we have to wait for Anna?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All right, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So first of all, Erin, I have sent you the updated reports  today.  Did you check that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No.  Can you show me?  Which one updated reports?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  For the one where the duplicates were showing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I see.  No, I didn't get a chance to get.  OK, you can review that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I did verify from my end as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I didn't find any duplicate.  But just in case, if I miss something,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  you can just let me know.  But I'm sure that there won't be any.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That's wonderful.  OK.  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me see.  Hello?  Can you hear me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  Yeah, I'll just try the second time.  The first time I can't hear it, the speaker doesn't work.  All right, now it's fine.  How are you?  I'm very good.  Well, thank you.  Jerry?  Yeah?  OK.  Good.  OK.  So, Wani, you can go and review what you have with Jerry.  And I'm going to look at the report he sent me.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm just reading from your side if you have any questions.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Just let's just start.  All right. <span style=""color:red""><b>  I have one that's on the problem list</b></span>.  One asks about the medical record.  OK.  Let me tell you that it was account number 5818.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Once again, 5818.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  I'm assuming the insurance asked.  It was your team said they need a doctor to sign up.  Actually, the EMG report, because I  have another technician doing the EMG and another neurology,  the doctor to guide the report.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So that's one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I didn't sign.  So I'm assuming that you can just send this.  Actually, I confirmed with him this morning.  He said he will check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  First of all, did we get a denial  from the insurance for this service or like what?  So just give me a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Sure.  Yeah.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So the letter that have been attached in the problem list  that has been sent to you guys to have it signed  from the doctor.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And because if you see that letter,  it's from the insurance and states<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  that it should have the signature for the provider</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So once we have that medical records,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  including the signature of the provider,  we can go out and obviously submit the claim</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  to the insurance again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm sure there would be some scenarios where obviously<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  insurance might ask for some kind of information<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  depending on some insurance's plans or something.  So you need the signature, even this electronic signature.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It could be electronically.  Just scan us again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  That medical records up to you guys.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  Actually, that's the document</b></span>.  So the EMGs always send it.  That's one.  Yeah, the document, the patient's document has the EMG.  Look at the EMG.  They have two.  And this one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  So you are talking about the report  that is uploaded on 7-29?  Oh, sorry</b></span>.  7-21-1523.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I have two EMGs.  One is on July 15th.  One on the July 9th.  I think it's one her.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Well, it would be good if we can get the signed document  for the one that we have attached.  And the problem is because there could be a possibility<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  that insurance only requires those letters<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  to be authorized from the provider, not any other ones.  So it is better if you submit the same thing  that insurance has requested us in order  to obviously get a denial and then we have  to reprocess the claim again.  Just a note.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Dr. Walsman, if you open that file.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, I'm just looking at that.  I am just looking at that.  487-29 and 7-14.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, the first page you can see that left,  it was another neurologist.  He's doing that on the right side of Dr. Walsman.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, well, I will have it checked with our team one more time.  And if there would be any possibility  that we can submit these letters to the insurance,  we will obviously go out and do that.  If not, then I will let Anna know, or you,  so that you have to sign those letters which have been  attached in the problem list.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK?  OK, all right.  So try to do this.  I think that was also the way that the office,  the way that the note media is set.  By this tension, I couldn't find the most of that. <span style=""color:red""><b>  I can see that the request for the notes  for the medical records on the United  United Healthcare, but this tension,  I couldn't find even the claims number or anything  that doesn't show anything</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, I will check with the team and we'll let you guys know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, please check that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  And so any other thing from your side?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think I gave it to Anna.  I don't know that they got it resolved already.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  It's account number 4700EGC9.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And we'll talk about that from the last view.  We just open that up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  No, this wasn't the patient that we  discussed in the last meeting.  I think so that was some other patient.  It wasn't discussed in the last meeting.  I'm sorry.  We did not have any discussion on this patient  in the last meeting.  I think because that was most probably some other concern.  If I look on the problem list for this patient,  that's a separate concern.  So it's a different patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No, if you look at the patient, I  think with the last meeting, we're  talking about cost that we received  the insurance matter, B9.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me just check my email.  I just sent the response to Anna the second day of the meeting.  Let me just pull up that email.  Just give me a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Hey, hey, Jerry.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the one we're talking about.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Patient that was discussed in the last meeting  is a call number 4948.  And I sent an email to Anna as well with the update<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  on that patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So that was not the same patient that you<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  are talking about right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  There was 4948 and this is 4700.  Yeah, it's a different one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm talking about the 4700.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So what questions do you have for this patient?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  This patient, we received the letter from the insurance.  That was the EET study.  That is patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We uploaded the insurance letter on this patient's letter.  Do you, can you specify any specific date of service<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  you're talking about?  It's both the same 2020.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, December 2020, 2022.  2022, I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So if you go to the problem list,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  the same concern has been added to the problem list.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  For that, partially paid the claim,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  but denied the CPD code 95, 9570 to the ICD issue  because the reported ICDs are not payable with CPD codes.  And according to CMS guidelines, their previously submitted  request for it's insist on the correct ICD code.  So here we just want to have the correct ICD code for the CPD  code used 95, 957.  R55, V89.2, and F17.200 are not payable with this CPD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So this is something that you guys have to check<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  and let us know that what should be the appropriate ICD  for the CPD code so that we can obviously  go out and resubmit the claim with the correct ICD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, so this code, and also we have another,  I think it's one or two pages, has the same issue  under the problem list now.  OK.  With about this code, it's 95, only for the valid.  It's the issue for the.  Yes.  Yes, only for the valid.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, that's right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So is it possible you guys can find that?  What's the replacement CPD code for this?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Sure, we can try out figuring out<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  that that should be used with the CPD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We will go ahead and attach the list of those ICDs<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  into the problem list.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  But still, you have to choose the most appropriate one  because we cannot go ahead and make it.  So we can just suggest to you for the ICD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The fact is that it's only for the New York State  to come from with the EMEG, the technique.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We've seen another code they're supposed to use.  And meanwhile, I will check with my team  if there would be any possibility  to get a list of the suggested ICD codes.  I will let you know that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Please.  Please.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I've noted that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The CPD code, the concerns will be the same.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  If you go ahead and obviously provide us  some resolution that will apply on all of these.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You're going to check that.  And also 916.  5916.  Let me see that.  They asked the insurance.  The insurance asked about the medical record for it.  Yeah.  If you all have a patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Patient.  Let me see.  There is no case being listed in the problem list.  But.  Oh, no.  The letter.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The letter is sent to our office.  And you say you're going to check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me just see that.  Just give me a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think that Anna has the problem too.  Not in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Well, I'm not sure if we have discussed this thing as well.  Because I'm not getting any data with this account  number in my record.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about again.  Because I knew that Anna, that the last meeting,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that two account number, even that's Anna 2.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And I was talking to the patient.  So I don't know that is the new word.  Putting it on our list.  Or you're going to check.  Yeah.  Please go ahead and check that.  I think that was for the July 21, 2023,  the visit record.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me just see the notes if there is any.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Oh, yes.  I remember that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, I got it.  I'm sorry.  So to the portal and 30 days to finalize.  So this is still in the process right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So you get the on the portal.  OK.  I think she said the little.  Yeah, that was you were talking about a 4948.  Yes.  I think that was Anna found that from the Medicare set.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  For the portal.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  For the portal, yeah.  Inpatient.  Yes.  From the March 24 to April 10.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  That's right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We don't know which hospital or somewhere.  We're guessing that it's probably in the rehab center.  Because the most rehab center, they  can send the patient to see any doctor.  They need to from the insurance and still show  that inpatient because they are in the rehab.  And the QMD, she has this experience.  Once this case, they are going to claim to that facility  to the rehab center.  And it's not a claim from our office.  And they're going to get the pay and they're  going to pay us back.  Something like that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So I sent the email to Anna as I mentioned earlier.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  But Anna did not respond to me with anything.  So if she has any updates on that<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  or she wants us to do something, please<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  ask her to reply to that email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  And we'll do that thing accordingly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  All right.  We got the denied claims.  And the patient was in the nursing home.  And our claims were denied by the insurance saying  that all the outpatient services should  be paid by the nursing home instead of the insurance.  Does it make sense to you?  That does not.  Because it's obviously through the portal,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that is information that is being shared with us as well.  And we don't know why insurance obviously has  this information in their records.  So because it's Medicare, they do not  provide a lot of information over the calls.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We do visit and this is what we got here,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that the patient was admitted in the hospital.  And so that is why the claim cannot be submitted at PUS 11<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  at the office location, even though we speak  because in our portal, the information</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  is showing something else.  Speak with Anna directly so we can be able to tell you.  Of course.  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Another thing is, Wendy, are you done?  OK.  So a couple of things.  One, for the EMG report, Wendy explained.  So we have the technician does the procedure.  And we have a neurologist who does the procedure as well,  but he will generate the current processes.  We have to print out his report, then Dr. Wang's review  and sign, and we have to attach the report back.  Is there a way that Dr. Wang can just sign it electronically?  For example, Yang Yang, our NP, who generates the report,  I don't know.  And Dr. Wang signs it and submit for claim.  How we do the same thing for the end?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I have to check that, and I will get back to you  with some answer on that.  Because for now, I can be very sure that either it<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  can be done or not.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  But let me just talk with our team  and see if there would be any possibility of doing that.  So you want to do it the same way as the other things have  been happening.  Your NP just creates the provider,  nor Dr. Wang just signs the e-super bill, and that's it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  But he had to sign off the EMT note.  OK, I will check it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  If there would be any possibility,  I will let you know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, sounds good.  And I just reviewed the report you sent me this morning.  It looks more realistic this time.  I haven't found anything funny yet,  but I will continue with you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm glad.  I'm glad for that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It looks much better.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Oh, finally.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank God.  Thank you.  And so Jerry, would you be able to provide  this monthly report then?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Of course, for the next month, moving ahead,  the same report will be shared with you,  having the real, accurate data.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, that would be great.  All right, so I don't have anything else.  Yeah, I guess we can wrap up the meeting.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So I do have a few things to say.  First thing is there is a patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We just got a call from a patient  negotiating with their bill.  And I sent that query to Anna, and she told me<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  she'll get back to me by the end of Friday.  And it's Monday, but I did not hear anything back from her.  So if you can just please ask her  to send me any updates for that patient as well, OK?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So which patient?  We have a video now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Of course.  The patient's account number is 57.  And I will let you know the name of that patient as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And one quick question here.  So I received a phone call from my mom.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  It is from Janice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And she has a patient referred by a new provider.  So it's kind of urgent.  This patient, I promised her to be seen on Wednesday  at 11 o'clock.  And she will email the patient information  to drwong at drwonguro.com.  You were talking about this Wednesday.  This Wednesday.  There's no procedure this Wednesday,  so we decided to move patients.  But another thing is Dr. Wong has two procedures on the 21st.  So he wants to move as many patients from 21st to the 20th,  as many as possible.  Yeah.  That's the year.  He will finish by two.  Yeah.  OK.  All right.  And also, Janice said, OK, her office  is calling us quite a few times, but nobody picked up a call.  I don't know which number they called,  but just make sure we answer their call.  Yeah, we have something.  When I was on the phone, I didn't pick up.  But the hospital number, I can see that.  I will pick up during the meeting we have.  But it's still only ring public twice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So we just kind of off.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  So this is something that happened to this phone too.  I think for some reason, they just ring two times.  Time is worse.  But the first time is worse.  Yeah.  I think it was the problem from the hour,  still from the hour on the visit.  Hopefully, we can fix the problem today.  Yes.  Please check this email, because another patient is  emailing us the medical records.  Yeah, I saw that.  That was a lot of medical records.  OK.  I just saw it.  It's a lot of medical records.  Perfect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  It's all done.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It's all done, right?  Yeah.  That's why you talk about a schedule only at 11.  Yeah.  OK.  OK.  OK.  Thank you, Jerry.  You can go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  No worries.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You want to show us?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  There is nothing to be showed, Young,  with an account number of 5790.  So there is a bill of $35 for 7-11-2023 date of service.  And the patient says that she has already paid the bill.  And she provided that was given to her by your office.  But that payment has not been posted into the system.  And there is no record of that payment into the system.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I just asked Anna, then let me<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  know if you guys received that payment so that we can go out  and post that payment, but apply for that patient.  If you guys can check that, I'd be really happy to give you  the more details.  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Did the patient say how he paid?  So what did he present you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me show you what he presented me.  Just give me a second.  Get anything from that payment proof?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I was like, OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  But this is something that the patient provided us.  So we're not sure if it was given by you guys.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Or I don't know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me know if you guys can screen the screen.  So, oh, sorry.  There is a payment date of credit.  And there is an amount of $35.  And this is prepared by 452.  So it means that obviously this print has  had to be taken from Care MD.  So obviously, someone from the office  gave this print to the patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, absolutely.  So I think since we have the receipt,  we definitely should make the correction.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So, OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Would you be able to?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Sorry, what?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Would you be able to make the correction?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yes, we can do that.  We'll just go ahead and post this payment against the data<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  service.  And that would be it.  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, thank you so much for that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And second thing is I just wanted<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  to discuss something regarding the portal of, let me search  the insurance, which was it.  So Anna is not in today, or is she just?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  Sure, I don't know why she has trouble to log in</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, so there is basically a portal request  for the MetroPlus health plan, which  has to be created from your side.  We have tried from our side, but it did not  allow us to create that portal.  So I mean, Wendy, if you use total or do you want?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Which portal, which one?  What the trial you said?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yes, MetroPlus health plan.  We have basically 42 claims that have been paid by the insurance.  And we do not have the EOBs. <span style=""color:red""><b>  And until we do not have the EOBs,  we cannot go ahead and post the payments, right?  So when we call the insurance to have the EOBs to the ERAs,  and we can get the EOBs or download the EOBs  from the portal and then post the payments</b></span>.  So we have tried creating the portal, but it was asking.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We have this portal.  You guys have the portal?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Oh, if you guys have it, please.  We were ensured that if you guys do have the portal or not.  So if you guys have it, that's superb.  We'll just go ahead and log in and download the EOBs  from there.  And if you guys allow us, we can go ahead and obviously<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  post the payments for those claims that have been<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  paid already by the insurance.  I'm just trying to see if it works.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And I will send you the login information.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Of course, of course.  Because there are 42 claims.  So until we post them, they will still obviously  be showing in our panning bucket.  And that will obviously increase our task  that we have to post it and all that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, if it works.  Yeah, I emailed you this.  It will not be any information.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Don't pay or I'll tell you right now.  And if EOBs from the portal, can we  go ahead and just post the payments against those EOBs?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, you said you asked me to do that.  I can do that again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Well, we just have to have the approval from your side.  Obviously, that's the guideline that you guys have established  that we cannot post the payments until you guys confirm  us to do so.  So even though if you download the EOBs from the portal,  still to post the payments.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Do you have this with the time period?  Or if I search that, would the patient,  do you have the information which patient?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yes, I have a list of all the patients.  Do you want me to send it to you right now?  Yes, please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Send it to this doc1 at doc1ur.com.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, just give me a second.  Let me just make it password protected.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So you are not allowed to use our login, is that what you  said?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We did not have the login, basically.  We were trying to create a new portal.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That's what I'm asking you.  Do you want me to send you the login information?  You can go from our side.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  You just have to share the credentials.  And we can go ahead and log in from our end.  And we will have any possibility for that.  Just a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, so you send me the list and the question.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm just sending you right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I want to check on later.  I didn't receive it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Just so on.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Dr. Wong at doc1ur.com.  Got you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Sending you right away.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, this Wednesday, Dr. Wong is going to start what, 10 o'clock?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  To 11.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know when Yang Yang can be there.  As soon as Yang Yang can be there.  If it's 11, I'm not able to move too many patients.  I tried 10.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So I've sent it to you.  Please check your email.  And if you have the credentials for that portal,  just share that with me.  Yes, please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Give me one second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So if you have to get some more time to check.  Hi, Wendy, can you hear me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, I can hear you.  Oh, OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I think I lost you guys.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I was saying if you guys need to,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  and you can share the credentials later<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  with me after the meeting.  Yeah, I'm going to call.  OK.  Sorry, I was distracted.  What's this issue is about?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  This was for the MetroPlus claims for the portal.  Oh, true.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I see, I see.  Do you need to provide information to Wendy,  or Wendy needs to provide information to you?  Actually, I was telling that we need<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  to create a new portal for the MetroPlus.  And Wendy told me that you guys already  have the portal for MetroPlus.  The credentials, the username, and the password to me.  And we can log in and download the EOBs from there.  And then post the payments accordingly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  I will let Wendy ask you any, Wendy to send you the information.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I think I'm done for the day as well.  If you guys do have any other information or any concerns,  just let me know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So do we have to wait for Wendy for now, or we're good to go?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No, I think we're good for now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  All right, so Erin, hopefully, see you on next Monday.  And have a good day.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm sorry.  Oh, yeah, Wendy's here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Finally.  I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I would just get a phone call from the patient.  OK.  Yeah.  Sorry, I missed something.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So Wendy, I was just saying, if you need some more time  to look at the details for the report, you can just do that.  And it will be right after the meeting as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So that's OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  I just look at it.  I get the report.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'll go over back to you.  Of that portal as well?  And there will be any security questions or something<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  you have?  I'm doing that now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, great.  Thank you so much for your time, guys.  Have a good day.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All right.  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Bye.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  See you next week.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Bye bye.<br>","EDI PM, EDI Transactions, Billing Payments, Quality Programs, Provider Notes, Labs",,"<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  to enable audio control.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Hey, Erin, can you hear me now?  Good morning, everyone.  I'm not sure if Erin, can you hear me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I can hear you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, that's good.  So do we have to wait for Anna?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All right, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So first of all, Erin, I have sent you the updated reports  today.  Did you check that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No.  Can you show me?  Which one updated reports?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  For the one where the duplicates were showing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I see.  No, I didn't get a chance to get.  OK, you can review that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I did verify from my end as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I didn't find any duplicate.  But just in case, if I miss something,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  you can just let me know.  But I'm sure that there won't be any.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That's wonderful.  OK.  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me see.  Hello?  Can you hear me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  Yeah, I'll just try the second time.  The first time I can't hear it, the speaker doesn't work.  All right, now it's fine.  How are you?  I'm very good.  Well, thank you.  Jerry?  Yeah?  OK.  Good.  OK.  So, Wani, you can go and review what you have with Jerry.  And I'm going to look at the report he sent me.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm just reading from your side if you have any questions.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Just let's just start.  All right.  I have one that's on the problem list.  One asks about the medical record.  OK.  Let me tell you that it was account number 5818.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Once again, 5818.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  I'm assuming the insurance asked.  It was your team said they need a doctor to sign up.  Actually, the EMG report, because I  have another technician doing the EMG and another neurology,  the doctor to guide the report.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So that's one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I didn't sign.  So I'm assuming that you can just send this.  Actually, I confirmed with him this morning.  He said he will check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  First of all, did we get a denial  from the insurance for this service or like what?  So just give me a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Sure.  Yeah.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So the letter that have been attached in the problem list  that has been sent to you guys to have it signed  from the doctor.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And because if you see that letter,  it's from the insurance and states<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that it should have the signature for the provider.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So once we have that medical records,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  including the signature of the provider,  we can go out and obviously submit the claim<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  to the insurance again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm sure there would be some scenarios where obviously<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  insurance might ask for some kind of information<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  depending on some insurance's plans or something.  So you need the signature, even this electronic signature.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It could be electronically.  Just scan us again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  That medical records up to you guys.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Actually, that's the document.  So the EMGs always send it.  That's one.  Yeah, the document, the patient's document has the EMG.  Look at the EMG.  They have two.  And this one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So you are talking about the report  that is uploaded on 7-29?  Oh, sorry.  7-21-1523.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I have two EMGs.  One is on July 15th.  One on the July 9th.  I think it's one her.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Well, it would be good if we can get the signed document  for the one that we have attached.  And the problem is because there could be a possibility<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  that insurance only requires those letters<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  to be authorized from the provider, not any other ones.  So it is better if you submit the same thing  that insurance has requested us in order  to obviously get a denial and then we have  to reprocess the claim again.  Just a note.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Dr. Walsman, if you open that file.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, I'm just looking at that.  I am just looking at that.  487-29 and 7-14.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, the first page you can see that left,  it was another neurologist.  He's doing that on the right side of Dr. Walsman.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, well, I will have it checked with our team one more time.  And if there would be any possibility  that we can submit these letters to the insurance,  we will obviously go out and do that.  If not, then I will let Anna know, or you,  so that you have to sign those letters which have been  attached in the problem list.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK?  OK, all right.  So try to do this.  I think that was also the way that the office,  the way that the note media is set.  By this tension, I couldn't find the most of that.  I can see that the request for the notes  for the medical records on the United  United Healthcare, but this tension,  I couldn't find even the claims number or anything  that doesn't show anything.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, I will check with the team and we'll let you guys know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, please check that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  And so any other thing from your side?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think I gave it to Anna.  I don't know that they got it resolved already.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  It's account number 4700EGC9.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And we'll talk about that from the last view.  We just open that up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  No, this wasn't the patient that we  discussed in the last meeting.  I think so that was some other patient.  It wasn't discussed in the last meeting.  I'm sorry.  We did not have any discussion on this patient  in the last meeting.  I think because that was most probably some other concern.  If I look on the problem list for this patient,  that's a separate concern.  So it's a different patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No, if you look at the patient, I  think with the last meeting, we're  talking about cost that we received  the insurance matter, B9.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me just check my email.  I just sent the response to Anna the second day of the meeting.  Let me just pull up that email.  Just give me a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Hey, hey, Jerry.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the one we're talking about.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Patient that was discussed in the last meeting  is a call number 4948.  And I sent an email to Anna as well with the update<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  on that patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So that was not the same patient that you<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  are talking about right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  There was 4948 and this is 4700.  Yeah, it's a different one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm talking about the 4700.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So what questions do you have for this patient?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  This patient, we received the letter from the insurance.  That was the EET study.  That is patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We uploaded the insurance letter on this patient's letter.  Do you, can you specify any specific date of service<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  you're talking about?  It's both the same 2020.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, December 2020, 2022.  2022, I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So if you go to the problem list,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  the same concern has been added to the problem list.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  For that, partially paid the claim,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  but denied the CPD code 95, 9570 to the ICD issue  because the reported ICDs are not payable with CPD codes.  And according to CMS guidelines, their previously submitted  request for it's insist on the correct ICD code.  So here we just want to have the correct ICD code for the CPD  code used 95, 957.  R55, V89.2, and F17.200 are not payable with this CPD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So this is something that you guys have to check<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  and let us know that what should be the appropriate ICD  for the CPD code so that we can obviously  go out and resubmit the claim with the correct ICD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, so this code, and also we have another,  I think it's one or two pages, has the same issue  under the problem list now.  OK.  With about this code, it's 95, only for the valid.  It's the issue for the.  Yes.  Yes, only for the valid.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, that's right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So is it possible you guys can find that?  What's the replacement CPD code for this?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Sure, we can try out figuring out<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  that that should be used with the CPD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We will go ahead and attach the list of those ICDs<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  into the problem list.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  But still, you have to choose the most appropriate one  because we cannot go ahead and make it.  So we can just suggest to you for the ICD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The fact is that it's only for the New York State  to come from with the EMEG, the technique.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We've seen another code they're supposed to use.  And meanwhile, I will check with my team  if there would be any possibility  to get a list of the suggested ICD codes.  I will let you know that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Please.  Please.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I've noted that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The CPD code, the concerns will be the same.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  If you go ahead and obviously provide us  some resolution that will apply on all of these.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You're going to check that.  And also 916.  5916.  Let me see that.  They asked the insurance.  The insurance asked about the medical record for it.  Yeah.  If you all have a patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Patient.  Let me see.  There is no case being listed in the problem list.  But.  Oh, no.  The letter.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The letter is sent to our office.  And you say you're going to check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me just see that.  Just give me a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think that Anna has the problem too.  Not in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Well, I'm not sure if we have discussed this thing as well.  Because I'm not getting any data with this account  number in my record.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about again.  Because I knew that Anna, that the last meeting,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that two account number, even that's Anna 2.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And I was talking to the patient.  So I don't know that is the new word.  Putting it on our list.  Or you're going to check.  Yeah.  Please go ahead and check that.  I think that was for the July 21, 2023,  the visit record.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me just see the notes if there is any.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Oh, yes.  I remember that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, I got it.  I'm sorry.  So to the portal and 30 days to finalize.  So this is still in the process right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So you get the on the portal.  OK.  I think she said the little.  Yeah, that was you were talking about a 4948.  Yes.  I think that was Anna found that from the Medicare set.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  For the portal.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  For the portal, yeah.  Inpatient.  Yes.  From the March 24 to April 10.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  That's right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We don't know which hospital or somewhere.  We're guessing that it's probably in the rehab center.  Because the most rehab center, they  can send the patient to see any doctor.  They need to from the insurance and still show  that inpatient because they are in the rehab.  And the QMD, she has this experience.  Once this case, they are going to claim to that facility  to the rehab center.  And it's not a claim from our office.  And they're going to get the pay and they're  going to pay us back.  Something like that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So I sent the email to Anna as I mentioned earlier.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  But Anna did not respond to me with anything.  So if she has any updates on that<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  or she wants us to do something, please<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  ask her to reply to that email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  And we'll do that thing accordingly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  All right.  We got the denied claims.  And the patient was in the nursing home.  And our claims were denied by the insurance saying  that all the outpatient services should  be paid by the nursing home instead of the insurance.  Does it make sense to you?  That does not.  Because it's obviously through the portal,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that is information that is being shared with us as well.  And we don't know why insurance obviously has  this information in their records.  So because it's Medicare, they do not  provide a lot of information over the calls.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We do visit and this is what we got here,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that the patient was admitted in the hospital.  And so that is why the claim cannot be submitted at PUS 11<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  at the office location, even though we speak  because in our portal, the information<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  is showing something else.  Speak with Anna directly so we can be able to tell you.  Of course.  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Another thing is, Wendy, are you done?  OK.  So a couple of things.  One, for the EMG report, Wendy explained.  So we have the technician does the procedure.  And we have a neurologist who does the procedure as well,  but he will generate the current processes.  We have to print out his report, then Dr. Wang's review  and sign, and we have to attach the report back.  Is there a way that Dr. Wang can just sign it electronically?  For example, Yang Yang, our NP, who generates the report,  I don't know.  And Dr. Wang signs it and submit for claim.  How we do the same thing for the end?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I have to check that, and I will get back to you  with some answer on that.  Because for now, I can be very sure that either it<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  can be done or not.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  But let me just talk with our team  and see if there would be any possibility of doing that.  So you want to do it the same way as the other things have  been happening.  Your NP just creates the provider,  nor Dr. Wang just signs the e-super bill, and that's it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  But he had to sign off the EMT note.  OK, I will check it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  If there would be any possibility,  I will let you know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, sounds good.  And I just reviewed the report you sent me this morning.  It looks more realistic this time.  I haven't found anything funny yet,  but I will continue with you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm glad.  I'm glad for that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It looks much better.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Oh, finally.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank God.  Thank you.  And so Jerry, would you be able to provide  this monthly report then?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Of course, for the next month, moving ahead,  the same report will be shared with you,  having the real, accurate data.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, that would be great.  All right, so I don't have anything else.  Yeah, I guess we can wrap up the meeting.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So I do have a few things to say.  First thing is there is a patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We just got a call from a patient  negotiating with their bill.  And I sent that query to Anna, and she told me<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  she'll get back to me by the end of Friday.  And it's Monday, but I did not hear anything back from her.  So if you can just please ask her  to send me any updates for that patient as well, OK?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So which patient?  We have a video now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Of course.  The patient's account number is 57.  And I will let you know the name of that patient as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And one quick question here.  So I received a phone call from my mom.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  It is from Janice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And she has a patient referred by a new provider.  So it's kind of urgent.  This patient, I promised her to be seen on Wednesday  at 11 o'clock.  And she will email the patient information  to drwong at drwonguro.com.  You were talking about this Wednesday.  This Wednesday.  There's no procedure this Wednesday,  so we decided to move patients.  But another thing is Dr. Wong has two procedures on the 21st.  So he wants to move as many patients from 21st to the 20th,  as many as possible.  Yeah.  That's the year.  He will finish by two.  Yeah.  OK.  All right.  And also, Janice said, OK, her office  is calling us quite a few times, but nobody picked up a call.  I don't know which number they called,  but just make sure we answer their call.  Yeah, we have something.  When I was on the phone, I didn't pick up.  But the hospital number, I can see that.  I will pick up during the meeting we have.  But it's still only ring public twice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So we just kind of off.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  So this is something that happened to this phone too.  I think for some reason, they just ring two times.  Time is worse.  But the first time is worse.  Yeah.  I think it was the problem from the hour,  still from the hour on the visit.  Hopefully, we can fix the problem today.  Yes.  Please check this email, because another patient is  emailing us the medical records.  Yeah, I saw that.  That was a lot of medical records.  OK.  I just saw it.  It's a lot of medical records.  Perfect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  It's all done.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It's all done, right?  Yeah.  That's why you talk about a schedule only at 11.  Yeah.  OK.  OK.  OK.  Thank you, Jerry.  You can go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  No worries.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You want to show us?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  There is nothing to be showed, Young,  with an account number of 5790.  So there is a bill of $35 for 7-11-2023 date of service.  And the patient says that she has already paid the bill.  And she provided that was given to her by your office.  But that payment has not been posted into the system.  And there is no record of that payment into the system.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I just asked Anna, then let me<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  know if you guys received that payment so that we can go out  and post that payment, but apply for that patient.  If you guys can check that, I'd be really happy to give you  the more details.  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Did the patient say how he paid?  So what did he present you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me show you what he presented me.  Just give me a second.  Get anything from that payment proof?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I was like, OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  But this is something that the patient provided us.  So we're not sure if it was given by you guys.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Or I don't know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me know if you guys can screen the screen.  So, oh, sorry.  There is a payment date of credit.  And there is an amount of $35.  And this is prepared by 452.  So it means that obviously this print has  had to be taken from Care MD.  So obviously, someone from the office  gave this print to the patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, absolutely.  So I think since we have the receipt,  we definitely should make the correction.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So, OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Would you be able to?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Sorry, what?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Would you be able to make the correction?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yes, we can do that.  We'll just go ahead and post this payment against the data<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  service.  And that would be it.  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, thank you so much for that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And second thing is I just wanted<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  to discuss something regarding the portal of, let me search  the insurance, which was it.  So Anna is not in today, or is she just?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Sure, I don't know why she has trouble to log in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, so there is basically a portal request  for the MetroPlus health plan, which  has to be created from your side.  We have tried from our side, but it did not  allow us to create that portal.  So I mean, Wendy, if you use total or do you want?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Which portal, which one?  What the trial you said?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yes, MetroPlus health plan.  We have basically 42 claims that have been paid by the insurance.  And we do not have the EOBs. <span style=""color:red""><b>  And until we do not have the EOBs,  we cannot go ahead and post the payments, right?  So when we call the insurance to have the EOBs to the ERAs,  and we can get the EOBs or download the EOBs  from the portal and then post the payments</b></span>.  So we have tried creating the portal, but it was asking.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We have this portal.  You guys have the portal?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Oh, if you guys have it, please.  We were ensured that if you guys do have the portal or not.  So if you guys have it, that's superb.  We'll just go ahead and log in and download the EOBs  from there.  And if you guys allow us, we can go ahead and obviously<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  post the payments for those claims that have been<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  paid already by the insurance.  I'm just trying to see if it works.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And I will send you the login information.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Of course, of course.  Because there are 42 claims.  So until we post them, they will still obviously  be showing in our panning bucket.  And that will obviously increase our task  that we have to post it and all that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, if it works.  Yeah, I emailed you this.  It will not be any information.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Don't pay or I'll tell you right now.  And if EOBs from the portal, can we  go ahead and just post the payments against those EOBs?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, you said you asked me to do that.  I can do that again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Well, we just have to have the approval from your side.  Obviously, that's the guideline that you guys have established  that we cannot post the payments until you guys confirm  us to do so.  So even though if you download the EOBs from the portal,  still to post the payments.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Do you have this with the time period?  Or if I search that, would the patient,  do you have the information which patient?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yes, I have a list of all the patients.  Do you want me to send it to you right now?  Yes, please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Send it to this doc1 at doc1ur.com.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, just give me a second.  Let me just make it password protected.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So you are not allowed to use our login, is that what you  said?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We did not have the login, basically.  We were trying to create a new portal.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That's what I'm asking you.  Do you want me to send you the login information?  You can go from our side.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  You just have to share the credentials.  And we can go ahead and log in from our end.  And we will have any possibility for that.  Just a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, so you send me the list and the question.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm just sending you right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I want to check on later.  I didn't receive it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Just so on.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Dr. Wong at doc1ur.com.  Got you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Sending you right away.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, this Wednesday, Dr. Wong is going to start what, 10 o'clock?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  To 11.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know when Yang Yang can be there.  As soon as Yang Yang can be there.  If it's 11, I'm not able to move too many patients.  I tried 10.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So I've sent it to you.  Please check your email.  And if you have the credentials for that portal,  just share that with me.  Yes, please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Give me one second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So if you have to get some more time to check.  Hi, Wendy, can you hear me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, I can hear you.  Oh, OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I think I lost you guys.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I was saying if you guys need to,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  and you can share the credentials later<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  with me after the meeting.  Yeah, I'm going to call.  OK.  Sorry, I was distracted.  What's this issue is about?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  This was for the MetroPlus claims for the portal.  Oh, true.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I see, I see.  Do you need to provide information to Wendy,  or Wendy needs to provide information to you?  Actually, I was telling that we need<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  to create a new portal for the MetroPlus.  And Wendy told me that you guys already  have the portal for MetroPlus.  The credentials, the username, and the password to me.  And we can log in and download the EOBs from there.  And then post the payments accordingly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  I will let Wendy ask you any, Wendy to send you the information.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I think I'm done for the day as well.  If you guys do have any other information or any concerns,  just let me know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So do we have to wait for Wendy for now, or we're good to go?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No, I think we're good for now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  All right, so Erin, hopefully, see you on next Monday.  And have a good day.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm sorry.  Oh, yeah, Wendy's here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Finally.  I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I would just get a phone call from the patient.  OK.  Yeah.  Sorry, I missed something.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So Wendy, I was just saying, if you need some more time  to look at the details for the report, you can just do that.  And it will be right after the meeting as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So that's OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  I just look at it.  I get the report.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'll go over back to you.  Of that portal as well?  And there will be any security questions or something<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  you have?  I'm doing that now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, great.  Thank you so much for your time, guys.  Have a good day.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All right.  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Bye.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  See you next week.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Bye bye.<br>","<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  to enable audio control.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Hey, Erin, can you hear me now?  Good morning, everyone.  I'm not sure if Erin, can you hear me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I can hear you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, that's good.  So do we have to wait for Anna?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All right, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So first of all, Erin, I have sent you the updated reports  today.  Did you check that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No.  Can you show me?  Which one updated reports?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  For the one where the duplicates were showing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I see.  No, I didn't get a chance to get.  OK, you can review that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I did verify from my end as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I didn't find any duplicate.  But just in case, if I miss something,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  you can just let me know.  But I'm sure that there won't be any.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That's wonderful.  OK.  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me see.  Hello?  Can you hear me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  Yeah, I'll just try the second time.  The first time I can't hear it, the speaker doesn't work.  All right, now it's fine.  How are you?  I'm very good.  Well, thank you.  Jerry?  Yeah?  OK.  Good.  OK.  So, Wani, you can go and review what you have with Jerry.  And I'm going to look at the report he sent me.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm just reading from your side if you have any questions.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Just let's just start.  All right. <span style=""color:red""><b>  I have one that's on the problem list</b></span>.  One asks about the medical record.  OK.  Let me tell you that it was account number 5818.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Once again, 5818.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  I'm assuming the insurance asked.  It was your team said they need a doctor to sign up.  Actually, the EMG report, because I  have another technician doing the EMG and another neurology,  the doctor to guide the report.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So that's one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I didn't sign.  So I'm assuming that you can just send this.  Actually, I confirmed with him this morning.  He said he will check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  First of all, did we get a denial  from the insurance for this service or like what?  So just give me a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Sure.  Yeah.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So the letter that have been attached in the problem list  that has been sent to you guys to have it signed  from the doctor.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And because if you see that letter,  it's from the insurance and states<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that it should have the signature for the provider.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So once we have that medical records,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  including the signature of the provider,  we can go out and obviously submit the claim<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  to the insurance again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm sure there would be some scenarios where obviously<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  insurance might ask for some kind of information<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  depending on some insurance's plans or something.  So you need the signature, even this electronic signature.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It could be electronically.  Just scan us again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  That medical records up to you guys.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Actually, that's the document.  So the EMGs always send it.  That's one.  Yeah, the document, the patient's document has the EMG.  Look at the EMG.  They have two.  And this one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So you are talking about the report  that is uploaded on 7-29?  Oh, sorry.  7-21-1523.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I have two EMGs.  One is on July 15th.  One on the July 9th.  I think it's one her.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Well, it would be good if we can get the signed document  for the one that we have attached.  And the problem is because there could be a possibility<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  that insurance only requires those letters<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  to be authorized from the provider, not any other ones.  So it is better if you submit the same thing  that insurance has requested us in order  to obviously get a denial and then we have  to reprocess the claim again.  Just a note.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Dr. Walsman, if you open that file.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, I'm just looking at that.  I am just looking at that.  487-29 and 7-14.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, the first page you can see that left,  it was another neurologist.  He's doing that on the right side of Dr. Walsman.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, well, I will have it checked with our team one more time.  And if there would be any possibility  that we can submit these letters to the insurance,  we will obviously go out and do that.  If not, then I will let Anna know, or you,  so that you have to sign those letters which have been  attached in the problem list.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK?  OK, all right.  So try to do this.  I think that was also the way that the office,  the way that the note media is set.  By this tension, I couldn't find the most of that.  I can see that the request for the notes  for the medical records on the United  United Healthcare, but this tension,  I couldn't find even the claims number or anything  that doesn't show anything.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, I will check with the team and we'll let you guys know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, please check that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  And so any other thing from your side?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think I gave it to Anna.  I don't know that they got it resolved already.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  It's account number 4700EGC9.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And we'll talk about that from the last view.  We just open that up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  No, this wasn't the patient that we  discussed in the last meeting.  I think so that was some other patient.  It wasn't discussed in the last meeting.  I'm sorry.  We did not have any discussion on this patient  in the last meeting.  I think because that was most probably some other concern.  If I look on the problem list for this patient,  that's a separate concern.  So it's a different patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No, if you look at the patient, I  think with the last meeting, we're  talking about cost that we received  the insurance matter, B9.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me just check my email.  I just sent the response to Anna the second day of the meeting.  Let me just pull up that email.  Just give me a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Hey, hey, Jerry.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the one we're talking about.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Patient that was discussed in the last meeting  is a call number 4948.  And I sent an email to Anna as well with the update<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  on that patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So that was not the same patient that you<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  are talking about right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  There was 4948 and this is 4700.  Yeah, it's a different one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm talking about the 4700.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So what questions do you have for this patient?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  This patient, we received the letter from the insurance.  That was the EET study.  That is patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We uploaded the insurance letter on this patient's letter.  Do you, can you specify any specific date of service<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  you're talking about?  It's both the same 2020.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, December 2020, 2022.  2022, I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So if you go to the problem list,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  the same concern has been added to the problem list.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  For that, partially paid the claim,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  but denied the CPD code 95, 9570 to the ICD issue  because the reported ICDs are not payable with CPD codes.  And according to CMS guidelines, their previously submitted  request for it's insist on the correct ICD code.  So here we just want to have the correct ICD code for the CPD  code used 95, 957.  R55, V89.2, and F17.200 are not payable with this CPD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So this is something that you guys have to check<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  and let us know that what should be the appropriate ICD  for the CPD code so that we can obviously  go out and resubmit the claim with the correct ICD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, so this code, and also we have another,  I think it's one or two pages, has the same issue  under the problem list now.  OK.  With about this code, it's 95, only for the valid.  It's the issue for the.  Yes.  Yes, only for the valid.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, that's right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So is it possible you guys can find that?  What's the replacement CPD code for this?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Sure, we can try out figuring out<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  that that should be used with the CPD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We will go ahead and attach the list of those ICDs<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  into the problem list.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  But still, you have to choose the most appropriate one  because we cannot go ahead and make it.  So we can just suggest to you for the ICD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The fact is that it's only for the New York State  to come from with the EMEG, the technique.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We've seen another code they're supposed to use.  And meanwhile, I will check with my team  if there would be any possibility  to get a list of the suggested ICD codes.  I will let you know that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Please.  Please.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I've noted that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The CPD code, the concerns will be the same.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  If you go ahead and obviously provide us  some resolution that will apply on all of these.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You're going to check that.  And also 916.  5916.  Let me see that.  They asked the insurance.  The insurance asked about the medical record for it.  Yeah.  If you all have a patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Patient.  Let me see.  There is no case being listed in the problem list.  But.  Oh, no.  The letter.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The letter is sent to our office.  And you say you're going to check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me just see that.  Just give me a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think that Anna has the problem too.  Not in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Well, I'm not sure if we have discussed this thing as well.  Because I'm not getting any data with this account  number in my record.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about again.  Because I knew that Anna, that the last meeting,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that two account number, even that's Anna 2.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And I was talking to the patient.  So I don't know that is the new word.  Putting it on our list.  Or you're going to check.  Yeah.  Please go ahead and check that.  I think that was for the July 21, 2023,  the visit record.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me just see the notes if there is any.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Oh, yes.  I remember that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, I got it.  I'm sorry.  So to the portal and 30 days to finalize.  So this is still in the process right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So you get the on the portal.  OK.  I think she said the little.  Yeah, that was you were talking about a 4948.  Yes.  I think that was Anna found that from the Medicare set.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  For the portal.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  For the portal, yeah.  Inpatient.  Yes.  From the March 24 to April 10.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  That's right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We don't know which hospital or somewhere.  We're guessing that it's probably in the rehab center.  Because the most rehab center, they  can send the patient to see any doctor.  They need to from the insurance and still show  that inpatient because they are in the rehab.  And the QMD, she has this experience.  Once this case, they are going to claim to that facility  to the rehab center.  And it's not a claim from our office.  And they're going to get the pay and they're  going to pay us back.  Something like that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So I sent the email to Anna as I mentioned earlier.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  But Anna did not respond to me with anything.  So if she has any updates on that<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  or she wants us to do something, please<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  ask her to reply to that email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  And we'll do that thing accordingly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  All right.  We got the denied claims.  And the patient was in the nursing home.  And our claims were denied by the insurance saying  that all the outpatient services should  be paid by the nursing home instead of the insurance.  Does it make sense to you?  That does not.  Because it's obviously through the portal,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that is information that is being shared with us as well.  And we don't know why insurance obviously has  this information in their records.  So because it's Medicare, they do not  provide a lot of information over the calls.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We do visit and this is what we got here,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that the patient was admitted in the hospital.  And so that is why the claim cannot be submitted at PUS 11<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  at the office location, even though we speak  because in our portal, the information<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  is showing something else.  Speak with Anna directly so we can be able to tell you.  Of course.  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Another thing is, Wendy, are you done?  OK.  So a couple of things.  One, for the EMG report, Wendy explained.  So we have the technician does the procedure.  And we have a neurologist who does the procedure as well,  but he will generate the current processes.  We have to print out his report, then Dr. Wang's review  and sign, and we have to attach the report back.  Is there a way that Dr. Wang can just sign it electronically?  For example, Yang Yang, our NP, who generates the report,  I don't know.  And Dr. Wang signs it and submit for claim.  How we do the same thing for the end?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I have to check that, and I will get back to you  with some answer on that.  Because for now, I can be very sure that either it<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  can be done or not.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  But let me just talk with our team  and see if there would be any possibility of doing that.  So you want to do it the same way as the other things have  been happening.  Your NP just creates the provider,  nor Dr. Wang just signs the e-super bill, and that's it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  But he had to sign off the EMT note.  OK, I will check it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  If there would be any possibility,  I will let you know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, sounds good.  And I just reviewed the report you sent me this morning.  It looks more realistic this time.  I haven't found anything funny yet,  but I will continue with you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm glad.  I'm glad for that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It looks much better.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Oh, finally.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank God.  Thank you.  And so Jerry, would you be able to provide  this monthly report then?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Of course, for the next month, moving ahead,  the same report will be shared with you,  having the real, accurate data.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, that would be great.  All right, so I don't have anything else.  Yeah, I guess we can wrap up the meeting.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So I do have a few things to say.  First thing is there is a patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We just got a call from a patient  negotiating with their bill.  And I sent that query to Anna, and she told me<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  she'll get back to me by the end of Friday.  And it's Monday, but I did not hear anything back from her.  So if you can just please ask her  to send me any updates for that patient as well, OK?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So which patient?  We have a video now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Of course.  The patient's account number is 57.  And I will let you know the name of that patient as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And one quick question here.  So I received a phone call from my mom.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  It is from Janice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And she has a patient referred by a new provider.  So it's kind of urgent.  This patient, I promised her to be seen on Wednesday  at 11 o'clock.  And she will email the patient information  to drwong at drwonguro.com.  You were talking about this Wednesday.  This Wednesday.  There's no procedure this Wednesday,  so we decided to move patients.  But another thing is Dr. Wong has two procedures on the 21st.  So he wants to move as many patients from 21st to the 20th,  as many as possible.  Yeah.  That's the year.  He will finish by two.  Yeah.  OK.  All right.  And also, Janice said, OK, her office  is calling us quite a few times, but nobody picked up a call.  I don't know which number they called,  but just make sure we answer their call.  Yeah, we have something.  When I was on the phone, I didn't pick up.  But the hospital number, I can see that.  I will pick up during the meeting we have.  But it's still only ring public twice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So we just kind of off.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  So this is something that happened to this phone too.  I think for some reason, they just ring two times.  Time is worse.  But the first time is worse.  Yeah.  I think it was the problem from the hour,  still from the hour on the visit.  Hopefully, we can fix the problem today.  Yes.  Please check this email, because another patient is  emailing us the medical records.  Yeah, I saw that.  That was a lot of medical records.  OK.  I just saw it.  It's a lot of medical records.  Perfect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  It's all done.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It's all done, right?  Yeah.  That's why you talk about a schedule only at 11.  Yeah.  OK.  OK.  OK.  Thank you, Jerry.  You can go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  No worries.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You want to show us?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  There is nothing to be showed, Young,  with an account number of 5790.  So there is a bill of $35 for 7-11-2023 date of service.  And the patient says that she has already paid the bill.  And she provided that was given to her by your office.  But that payment has not been posted into the system.  And there is no record of that payment into the system.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I just asked Anna, then let me<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  know if you guys received that payment so that we can go out  and post that payment, but apply for that patient.  If you guys can check that, I'd be really happy to give you  the more details.  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Did the patient say how he paid?  So what did he present you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me show you what he presented me.  Just give me a second.  Get anything from that payment proof?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I was like, OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  But this is something that the patient provided us.  So we're not sure if it was given by you guys.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Or I don't know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me know if you guys can screen the screen.  So, oh, sorry.  There is a payment date of credit.  And there is an amount of $35.  And this is prepared by 452.  So it means that obviously this print has  had to be taken from Care MD.  So obviously, someone from the office  gave this print to the patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, absolutely.  So I think since we have the receipt,  we definitely should make the correction.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So, OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Would you be able to?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Sorry, what?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Would you be able to make the correction?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yes, we can do that.  We'll just go ahead and post this payment against the data<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  service.  And that would be it.  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, thank you so much for that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And second thing is I just wanted<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  to discuss something regarding the portal of, let me search  the insurance, which was it.  So Anna is not in today, or is she just?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Sure, I don't know why she has trouble to log in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, so there is basically a portal request  for the MetroPlus health plan, which  has to be created from your side.  We have tried from our side, but it did not  allow us to create that portal.  So I mean, Wendy, if you use total or do you want?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Which portal, which one?  What the trial you said?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yes, MetroPlus health plan.  We have basically 42 claims that have been paid by the insurance.  And we do not have the EOBs.  And until we do not have the EOBs,  we cannot go ahead and post the payments, right?  So when we call the insurance to have the EOBs to the ERAs,  and we can get the EOBs or download the EOBs  from the portal and then post the payments.  So we have tried creating the portal, but it was asking.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We have this portal.  You guys have the portal?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Oh, if you guys have it, please.  We were ensured that if you guys do have the portal or not.  So if you guys have it, that's superb.  We'll just go ahead and log in and download the EOBs  from there.  And if you guys allow us, we can go ahead and obviously<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  post the payments for those claims that have been<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  paid already by the insurance.  I'm just trying to see if it works.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And I will send you the login information.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Of course, of course.  Because there are 42 claims.  So until we post them, they will still obviously  be showing in our panning bucket.  And that will obviously increase our task  that we have to post it and all that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, if it works.  Yeah, I emailed you this.  It will not be any information.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Don't pay or I'll tell you right now.  And if EOBs from the portal, can we  go ahead and just post the payments against those EOBs?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, you said you asked me to do that.  I can do that again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Well, we just have to have the approval from your side.  Obviously, that's the guideline that you guys have established  that we cannot post the payments until you guys confirm  us to do so.  So even though if you download the EOBs from the portal,  still to post the payments.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Do you have this with the time period?  Or if I search that, would the patient,  do you have the information which patient?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yes, I have a list of all the patients.  Do you want me to send it to you right now?  Yes, please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Send it to this doc1 at doc1ur.com.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, just give me a second.  Let me just make it password protected.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So you are not allowed to use our login, is that what you  said?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We did not have the login, basically.  We were trying to create a new portal.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That's what I'm asking you.  Do you want me to send you the login information?  You can go from our side.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  You just have to share the credentials.  And we can go ahead and log in from our end.  And we will have any possibility for that.  Just a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, so you send me the list and the question.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm just sending you right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I want to check on later.  I didn't receive it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Just so on.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Dr. Wong at doc1ur.com.  Got you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Sending you right away.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, this Wednesday, Dr. Wong is going to start what, 10 o'clock?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  To 11.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know when Yang Yang can be there.  As soon as Yang Yang can be there.  If it's 11, I'm not able to move too many patients.  I tried 10.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So I've sent it to you.  Please check your email.  And if you have the credentials for that portal,  just share that with me.  Yes, please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Give me one second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So if you have to get some more time to check.  Hi, Wendy, can you hear me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, I can hear you.  Oh, OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I think I lost you guys.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I was saying if you guys need to,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  and you can share the credentials later<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  with me after the meeting.  Yeah, I'm going to call.  OK.  Sorry, I was distracted.  What's this issue is about?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  This was for the MetroPlus claims for the portal.  Oh, true.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I see, I see.  Do you need to provide information to Wendy,  or Wendy needs to provide information to you?  Actually, I was telling that we need<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  to create a new portal for the MetroPlus.  And Wendy told me that you guys already  have the portal for MetroPlus.  The credentials, the username, and the password to me.  And we can log in and download the EOBs from there.  And then post the payments accordingly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  I will let Wendy ask you any, Wendy to send you the information.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I think I'm done for the day as well.  If you guys do have any other information or any concerns,  just let me know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So do we have to wait for Wendy for now, or we're good to go?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No, I think we're good for now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  All right, so Erin, hopefully, see you on next Monday.  And have a good day.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm sorry.  Oh, yeah, Wendy's here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Finally.  I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I would just get a phone call from the patient.  OK.  Yeah.  Sorry, I missed something.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So Wendy, I was just saying, if you need some more time  to look at the details for the report, you can just do that.  And it will be right after the meeting as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So that's OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  I just look at it.  I get the report.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'll go over back to you.  Of that portal as well?  And there will be any security questions or something<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  you have?  I'm doing that now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, great.  Thank you so much for your time, guys.  Have a good day.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All right.  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Bye.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  See you next week.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Bye bye.<br>",,"<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  to enable audio control.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Hey, Erin, can you hear me now?  Good morning, everyone.  I'm not sure if Erin, can you hear me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I can hear you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, that's good.  So do we have to wait for Anna?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All right, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So first of all, Erin, I have sent you the updated reports  today.  Did you check that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No.  Can you show me?  Which one updated reports?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  For the one where the duplicates were showing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I see.  No, I didn't get a chance to get.  OK, you can review that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I did verify from my end as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I didn't find any duplicate.  But just in case, if I miss something,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  you can just let me know.  But I'm sure that there won't be any.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That's wonderful.  OK.  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me see.  Hello?  Can you hear me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  Yeah, I'll just try the second time.  The first time I can't hear it, the speaker doesn't work.  All right, now it's fine.  How are you?  I'm very good.  Well, thank you.  Jerry?  Yeah?  OK.  Good.  OK.  So, Wani, you can go and review what you have with Jerry.  And I'm going to look at the report he sent me.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm just reading from your side if you have any questions.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Just let's just start.  All right.  I have one that's on the problem list.  One asks about the medical record.  OK.  Let me tell you that it was account number 5818.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Once again, 5818.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  I'm assuming the insurance asked.  It was your team said they need a doctor to sign up.  Actually, the EMG report, because I  have another technician doing the EMG and another neurology,  the doctor to guide the report.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So that's one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I didn't sign.  So I'm assuming that you can just send this.  Actually, I confirmed with him this morning.  He said he will check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  First of all, did we get a denial  from the insurance for this service or like what?  So just give me a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Sure.  Yeah.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So the letter that have been attached in the problem list  that has been sent to you guys to have it signed  from the doctor.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And because if you see that letter,  it's from the insurance and states<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that it should have the signature for the provider.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So once we have that medical records,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  including the signature of the provider,  we can go out and obviously submit the claim<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  to the insurance again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm sure there would be some scenarios where obviously<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  insurance might ask for some kind of information<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  depending on some insurance's plans or something.  So you need the signature, even this electronic signature.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It could be electronically.  Just scan us again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  That medical records up to you guys.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Actually, that's the document.  So the EMGs always send it.  That's one.  Yeah, the document, the patient's document has the EMG.  Look at the EMG.  They have two.  And this one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So you are talking about the report  that is uploaded on 7-29?  Oh, sorry.  7-21-1523.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I have two EMGs.  One is on July 15th.  One on the July 9th.  I think it's one her.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Well, it would be good if we can get the signed document  for the one that we have attached.  And the problem is because there could be a possibility<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  that insurance only requires those letters<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  to be authorized from the provider, not any other ones.  So it is better if you submit the same thing  that insurance has requested us in order  to obviously get a denial and then we have  to reprocess the claim again.  Just a note.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Dr. Walsman, if you open that file.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, I'm just looking at that.  I am just looking at that.  487-29 and 7-14.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, the first page you can see that left,  it was another neurologist.  He's doing that on the right side of Dr. Walsman.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, well, I will have it checked with our team one more time.  And if there would be any possibility  that we can submit these letters to the insurance,  we will obviously go out and do that.  If not, then I will let Anna know, or you,  so that you have to sign those letters which have been  attached in the problem list.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK?  OK, all right.  So try to do this.  I think that was also the way that the office,  the way that the note media is set.  By this tension, I couldn't find the most of that.  I can see that the request for the notes  for the medical records on the United  United Healthcare, but this tension,  I couldn't find even the claims number or anything  that doesn't show anything.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, I will check with the team and we'll let you guys know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, please check that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  And so any other thing from your side?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think I gave it to Anna.  I don't know that they got it resolved already.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  It's account number 4700EGC9.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And we'll talk about that from the last view.  We just open that up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  No, this wasn't the patient that we  discussed in the last meeting.  I think so that was some other patient.  It wasn't discussed in the last meeting.  I'm sorry.  We did not have any discussion on this patient  in the last meeting.  I think because that was most probably some other concern.  If I look on the problem list for this patient,  that's a separate concern.  So it's a different patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No, if you look at the patient, I  think with the last meeting, we're  talking about cost that we received  the insurance matter, B9.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me just check my email.  I just sent the response to Anna the second day of the meeting.  Let me just pull up that email.  Just give me a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Hey, hey, Jerry.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the one we're talking about.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Patient that was discussed in the last meeting  is a call number 4948.  And I sent an email to Anna as well with the update<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  on that patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So that was not the same patient that you<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  are talking about right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  There was 4948 and this is 4700.  Yeah, it's a different one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm talking about the 4700.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So what questions do you have for this patient?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  This patient, we received the letter from the insurance.  That was the EET study.  That is patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We uploaded the insurance letter on this patient's letter.  Do you, can you specify any specific date of service<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  you're talking about?  It's both the same 2020.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, December 2020, 2022.  2022, I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So if you go to the problem list,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  the same concern has been added to the problem list.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  For that, partially paid the claim,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  but denied the CPD code 95, 9570 to the ICD issue  because the reported ICDs are not payable with CPD codes.  And according to CMS guidelines, their previously submitted  request for it's insist on the correct ICD code.  So here we just want to have the correct ICD code for the CPD  code used 95, 957.  R55, V89.2, and F17.200 are not payable with this CPD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So this is something that you guys have to check<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  and let us know that what should be the appropriate ICD  for the CPD code so that we can obviously  go out and resubmit the claim with the correct ICD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, so this code, and also we have another,  I think it's one or two pages, has the same issue  under the problem list now.  OK.  With about this code, it's 95, only for the valid.  It's the issue for the.  Yes.  Yes, only for the valid.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, that's right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So is it possible you guys can find that?  What's the replacement CPD code for this?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Sure, we can try out figuring out<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  that that should be used with the CPD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We will go ahead and attach the list of those ICDs<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  into the problem list.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  But still, you have to choose the most appropriate one  because we cannot go ahead and make it.  So we can just suggest to you for the ICD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The fact is that it's only for the New York State  to come from with the EMEG, the technique.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We've seen another code they're supposed to use.  And meanwhile, I will check with my team  if there would be any possibility  to get a list of the suggested ICD codes.  I will let you know that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Please.  Please.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I've noted that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The CPD code, the concerns will be the same.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  If you go ahead and obviously provide us  some resolution that will apply on all of these.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You're going to check that.  And also 916.  5916.  Let me see that.  They asked the insurance.  The insurance asked about the medical record for it.  Yeah.  If you all have a patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Patient.  Let me see.  There is no case being listed in the problem list.  But.  Oh, no.  The letter.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The letter is sent to our office.  And you say you're going to check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me just see that.  Just give me a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think that Anna has the problem too.  Not in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Well, I'm not sure if we have discussed this thing as well.  Because I'm not getting any data with this account  number in my record.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about again.  Because I knew that Anna, that the last meeting,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that two account number, even that's Anna 2.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And I was talking to the patient.  So I don't know that is the new word.  Putting it on our list.  Or you're going to check.  Yeah.  Please go ahead and check that.  I think that was for the July 21, 2023,  the visit record.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me just see the notes if there is any.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Oh, yes.  I remember that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, I got it.  I'm sorry.  So to the portal and 30 days to finalize.  So this is still in the process right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So you get the on the portal.  OK.  I think she said the little.  Yeah, that was you were talking about a 4948.  Yes.  I think that was Anna found that from the Medicare set.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  For the portal.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  For the portal, yeah.  Inpatient.  Yes.  From the March 24 to April 10.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  That's right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We don't know which hospital or somewhere.  We're guessing that it's probably in the rehab center.  Because the most rehab center, they  can send the patient to see any doctor.  They need to from the insurance and still show  that inpatient because they are in the rehab.  And the QMD, she has this experience.  Once this case, they are going to claim to that facility  to the rehab center.  And it's not a claim from our office.  And they're going to get the pay and they're  going to pay us back.  Something like that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So I sent the email to Anna as I mentioned earlier.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  But Anna did not respond to me with anything.  So if she has any updates on that<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  or she wants us to do something, please<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  ask her to reply to that email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  And we'll do that thing accordingly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  All right.  We got the denied claims.  And the patient was in the nursing home.  And our claims were denied by the insurance saying  that all the outpatient services should  be paid by the nursing home instead of the insurance.  Does it make sense to you?  That does not.  Because it's obviously through the portal,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that is information that is being shared with us as well.  And we don't know why insurance obviously has  this information in their records.  So because it's Medicare, they do not  provide a lot of information over the calls.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We do visit and this is what we got here,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that the patient was admitted in the hospital.  And so that is why the claim cannot be submitted at PUS 11<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  at the office location, even though we speak  because in our portal, the information<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  is showing something else.  Speak with Anna directly so we can be able to tell you.  Of course.  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Another thing is, Wendy, are you done?  OK.  So a couple of things.  One, for the EMG report, Wendy explained.  So we have the technician does the procedure.  And we have a neurologist who does the procedure as well,  but he will generate the current processes.  We have to print out his report, then Dr. Wang's review  and sign, and we have to attach the report back.  Is there a way that Dr. Wang can just sign it electronically?  For example, Yang Yang, our NP, who generates the report,  I don't know.  And Dr. Wang signs it and submit for claim.  How we do the same thing for the end?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I have to check that, and I will get back to you  with some answer on that.  Because for now, I can be very sure that either it<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  can be done or not.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  But let me just talk with our team  and see if there would be any possibility of doing that.  So you want to do it the same way as the other things have  been happening.  Your NP just creates the provider,  nor Dr. Wang just signs the e-super bill, and that's it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  But he had to sign off the EMT note.  OK, I will check it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  If there would be any possibility,  I will let you know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, sounds good.  And I just reviewed the report you sent me this morning.  It looks more realistic this time.  I haven't found anything funny yet,  but I will continue with you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm glad.  I'm glad for that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It looks much better.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Oh, finally.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank God.  Thank you.  And so Jerry, would you be able to provide  this monthly report then?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Of course, for the next month, moving ahead,  the same report will be shared with you,  having the real, accurate data.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, that would be great.  All right, so I don't have anything else.  Yeah, I guess we can wrap up the meeting.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So I do have a few things to say.  First thing is there is a patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We just got a call from a patient  negotiating with their bill.  And I sent that query to Anna, and she told me<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  she'll get back to me by the end of Friday.  And it's Monday, but I did not hear anything back from her.  So if you can just please ask her  to send me any updates for that patient as well, OK?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So which patient?  We have a video now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Of course.  The patient's account number is 57.  And I will let you know the name of that patient as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And one quick question here.  So I received a phone call from my mom.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  It is from Janice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And she has a patient referred by a new provider.  So it's kind of urgent.  This patient, I promised her to be seen on Wednesday  at 11 o'clock.  And she will email the patient information  to drwong at drwonguro.com.  You were talking about this Wednesday.  This Wednesday.  There's no procedure this Wednesday,  so we decided to move patients.  But another thing is Dr. Wong has two procedures on the 21st.  So he wants to move as many patients from 21st to the 20th,  as many as possible.  Yeah.  That's the year.  He will finish by two.  Yeah.  OK.  All right.  And also, Janice said, OK, her office  is calling us quite a few times, but nobody picked up a call.  I don't know which number they called,  but just make sure we answer their call.  Yeah, we have something.  When I was on the phone, I didn't pick up.  But the hospital number, I can see that.  I will pick up during the meeting we have.  But it's still only ring public twice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So we just kind of off.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  So this is something that happened to this phone too.  I think for some reason, they just ring two times.  Time is worse.  But the first time is worse.  Yeah.  I think it was the problem from the hour,  still from the hour on the visit.  Hopefully, we can fix the problem today.  Yes.  Please check this email, because another patient is  emailing us the medical records.  Yeah, I saw that.  That was a lot of medical records.  OK.  I just saw it.  It's a lot of medical records.  Perfect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  It's all done.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It's all done, right?  Yeah.  That's why you talk about a schedule only at 11.  Yeah.  OK.  OK.  OK.  Thank you, Jerry.  You can go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  No worries.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You want to show us?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  There is nothing to be showed, Young,  with an account number of 5790.  So there is a bill of $35 for 7-11-2023 date of service.  And the patient says that she has already paid the bill.  And she provided that was given to her by your office.  But that payment has not been posted into the system.  And there is no record of that payment into the system.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I just asked Anna, then let me<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  know if you guys received that payment so that we can go out  and post that payment, but apply for that patient.  If you guys can check that, I'd be really happy to give you  the more details.  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Did the patient say how he paid?  So what did he present you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me show you what he presented me.  Just give me a second.  Get anything from that payment proof?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I was like, OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  But this is something that the patient provided us.  So we're not sure if it was given by you guys.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Or I don't know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me know if you guys can screen the screen.  So, oh, sorry.  There is a payment date of credit.  And there is an amount of $35.  And this is prepared by 452.  So it means that obviously this print has  had to be taken from Care MD.  So obviously, someone from the office  gave this print to the patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, absolutely.  So I think since we have the receipt,  we definitely should make the correction.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So, OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Would you be able to?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Sorry, what?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Would you be able to make the correction?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yes, we can do that.  We'll just go ahead and post this payment against the data<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  service.  And that would be it.  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, thank you so much for that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And second thing is I just wanted<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  to discuss something regarding the portal of, let me search  the insurance, which was it.  So Anna is not in today, or is she just?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  Sure, I don't know why she has trouble to log in</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, so there is basically a portal request  for the MetroPlus health plan, which  has to be created from your side.  We have tried from our side, but it did not  allow us to create that portal.  So I mean, Wendy, if you use total or do you want?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Which portal, which one?  What the trial you said?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yes, MetroPlus health plan.  We have basically 42 claims that have been paid by the insurance.  And we do not have the EOBs.  And until we do not have the EOBs,  we cannot go ahead and post the payments, right?  So when we call the insurance to have the EOBs to the ERAs,  and we can get the EOBs or download the EOBs  from the portal and then post the payments.  So we have tried creating the portal, but it was asking.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We have this portal.  You guys have the portal?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Oh, if you guys have it, please.  We were ensured that if you guys do have the portal or not.  So if you guys have it, that's superb.  We'll just go ahead and log in and download the EOBs  from there.  And if you guys allow us, we can go ahead and obviously<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  post the payments for those claims that have been<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  paid already by the insurance.  I'm just trying to see if it works.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And I will send you the login information.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Of course, of course.  Because there are 42 claims.  So until we post them, they will still obviously  be showing in our panning bucket.  And that will obviously increase our task  that we have to post it and all that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, if it works.  Yeah, I emailed you this.  It will not be any information.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Don't pay or I'll tell you right now.  And if EOBs from the portal, can we  go ahead and just post the payments against those EOBs?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, you said you asked me to do that.  I can do that again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Well, we just have to have the approval from your side.  Obviously, that's the guideline that you guys have established  that we cannot post the payments until you guys confirm  us to do so.  So even though if you download the EOBs from the portal,  still to post the payments.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Do you have this with the time period?  Or if I search that, would the patient,  do you have the information which patient?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yes, I have a list of all the patients.  Do you want me to send it to you right now?  Yes, please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Send it to this doc1 at doc1ur.com.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, just give me a second.  Let me just make it password protected.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So you are not allowed to use our login, is that what you  said?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We did not have the login, basically.  We were trying to create a new portal.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That's what I'm asking you.  Do you want me to send you the login information?  You can go from our side.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  You just have to share the credentials.  And we can go ahead and log in from our end.  And we will have any possibility for that.  Just a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, so you send me the list and the question.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm just sending you right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I want to check on later.  I didn't receive it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Just so on.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Dr. Wong at doc1ur.com.  Got you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Sending you right away.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, this Wednesday, Dr. Wong is going to start what, 10 o'clock?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  To 11.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know when Yang Yang can be there.  As soon as Yang Yang can be there.  If it's 11, I'm not able to move too many patients.  I tried 10.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So I've sent it to you.  Please check your email.  And if you have the credentials for that portal,  just share that with me.  Yes, please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Give me one second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So if you have to get some more time to check.  Hi, Wendy, can you hear me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, I can hear you.  Oh, OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I think I lost you guys.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I was saying if you guys need to,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  and you can share the credentials later<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  with me after the meeting.  Yeah, I'm going to call.  OK.  Sorry, I was distracted.  What's this issue is about?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  This was for the MetroPlus claims for the portal.  Oh, true.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I see, I see.  Do you need to provide information to Wendy,  or Wendy needs to provide information to you?  Actually, I was telling that we need<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  to create a new portal for the MetroPlus.  And Wendy told me that you guys already  have the portal for MetroPlus.  The credentials, the username, and the password to me.  And we can log in and download the EOBs from there.  And then post the payments accordingly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  I will let Wendy ask you any, Wendy to send you the information.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I think I'm done for the day as well.  If you guys do have any other information or any concerns,  just let me know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So do we have to wait for Wendy for now, or we're good to go?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No, I think we're good for now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  All right, so Erin, hopefully, see you on next Monday.  And have a good day.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm sorry.  Oh, yeah, Wendy's here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Finally.  I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I would just get a phone call from the patient.  OK.  Yeah.  Sorry, I missed something.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So Wendy, I was just saying, if you need some more time  to look at the details for the report, you can just do that.  And it will be right after the meeting as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So that's OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  I just look at it.  I get the report.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'll go over back to you.  Of that portal as well?  And there will be any security questions or something<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  you have?  I'm doing that now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, great.  Thank you so much for your time, guys.  Have a good day.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All right.  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Bye.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  See you next week.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Bye bye.<br>",,,"<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  to enable audio control.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Hey, Erin, can you hear me now?  Good morning, everyone.  I'm not sure if Erin, can you hear me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I can hear you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, that's good.  So do we have to wait for Anna?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All right, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So first of all, Erin, I have sent you the updated reports  today.  Did you check that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No.  Can you show me?  Which one updated reports?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  For the one where the duplicates were showing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I see.  No, I didn't get a chance to get.  OK, you can review that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I did verify from my end as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I didn't find any duplicate.  But just in case, if I miss something,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  you can just let me know.  But I'm sure that there won't be any.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That's wonderful.  OK.  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me see.  Hello?  Can you hear me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  Yeah, I'll just try the second time.  The first time I can't hear it, the speaker doesn't work.  All right, now it's fine.  How are you?  I'm very good.  Well, thank you.  Jerry?  Yeah?  OK.  Good.  OK.  So, Wani, you can go and review what you have with Jerry.  And I'm going to look at the report he sent me.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm just reading from your side if you have any questions.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Just let's just start.  All right.  I have one that's on the problem list.  One asks about the medical record.  OK.  Let me tell you that it was account number 5818.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Once again, 5818.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  I'm assuming the insurance asked.  It was your team said they need a doctor to sign up.  Actually, the EMG report, because I  have another technician doing the EMG and another neurology,  the doctor to guide the report.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So that's one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I didn't sign.  So I'm assuming that you can just send this.  Actually, I confirmed with him this morning.  He said he will check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  First of all, did we get a denial  from the insurance for this service or like what?  So just give me a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Sure.  Yeah.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So the letter that have been attached in the problem list  that has been sent to you guys to have it signed  from the doctor.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And because if you see that letter,  it's from the insurance and states<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  that it should have the signature for the provider</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So once we have that medical records,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  including the signature of the provider,  we can go out and obviously submit the claim</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  to the insurance again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm sure there would be some scenarios where obviously<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  insurance might ask for some kind of information<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  depending on some insurance's plans or something.  So you need the signature, even this electronic signature.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It could be electronically.  Just scan us again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  That medical records up to you guys.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  Actually, that's the document</b></span>.  So the EMGs always send it.  That's one.  Yeah, the document, the patient's document has the EMG.  Look at the EMG.  They have two.  And this one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  So you are talking about the report  that is uploaded on 7-29?  Oh, sorry</b></span>.  7-21-1523.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I have two EMGs.  One is on July 15th.  One on the July 9th.  I think it's one her.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Well, it would be good if we can get the signed document  for the one that we have attached.  And the problem is because there could be a possibility<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  that insurance only requires those letters<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  to be authorized from the provider, not any other ones.  So it is better if you submit the same thing  that insurance has requested us in order  to obviously get a denial and then we have  to reprocess the claim again.  Just a note.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Dr. Walsman, if you open that file.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, I'm just looking at that.  I am just looking at that.  487-29 and 7-14.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, the first page you can see that left,  it was another neurologist.  He's doing that on the right side of Dr. Walsman.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, well, I will have it checked with our team one more time.  And if there would be any possibility  that we can submit these letters to the insurance,  we will obviously go out and do that.  If not, then I will let Anna know, or you,  so that you have to sign those letters which have been  attached in the problem list.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK?  OK, all right.  So try to do this.  I think that was also the way that the office,  the way that the note media is set.  By this tension, I couldn't find the most of that.  I can see that the request for the notes  for the medical records on the United  United Healthcare, but this tension,  I couldn't find even the claims number or anything  that doesn't show anything.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, I will check with the team and we'll let you guys know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, please check that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  And so any other thing from your side?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think I gave it to Anna.  I don't know that they got it resolved already.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  It's account number 4700EGC9.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And we'll talk about that from the last view.  We just open that up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  No, this wasn't the patient that we  discussed in the last meeting.  I think so that was some other patient.  It wasn't discussed in the last meeting.  I'm sorry.  We did not have any discussion on this patient  in the last meeting.  I think because that was most probably some other concern.  If I look on the problem list for this patient,  that's a separate concern.  So it's a different patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No, if you look at the patient, I  think with the last meeting, we're  talking about cost that we received  the insurance matter, B9.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me just check my email.  I just sent the response to Anna the second day of the meeting.  Let me just pull up that email.  Just give me a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Hey, hey, Jerry.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the one we're talking about.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Patient that was discussed in the last meeting  is a call number 4948.  And I sent an email to Anna as well with the update<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  on that patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So that was not the same patient that you<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  are talking about right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  There was 4948 and this is 4700.  Yeah, it's a different one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm talking about the 4700.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So what questions do you have for this patient?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  This patient, we received the letter from the insurance.  That was the EET study.  That is patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We uploaded the insurance letter on this patient's letter.  Do you, can you specify any specific date of service<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  you're talking about?  It's both the same 2020.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, December 2020, 2022.  2022, I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So if you go to the problem list,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  the same concern has been added to the problem list.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  For that, partially paid the claim,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  but denied the CPD code 95, 9570 to the ICD issue  because the reported ICDs are not payable with CPD codes.  And according to CMS guidelines, their previously submitted  request for it's insist on the correct ICD code.  So here we just want to have the correct ICD code for the CPD  code used 95, 957.  R55, V89.2, and F17.200 are not payable with this CPD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So this is something that you guys have to check<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  and let us know that what should be the appropriate ICD  for the CPD code so that we can obviously  go out and resubmit the claim with the correct ICD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, so this code, and also we have another,  I think it's one or two pages, has the same issue  under the problem list now.  OK.  With about this code, it's 95, only for the valid.  It's the issue for the.  Yes.  Yes, only for the valid.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, that's right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So is it possible you guys can find that?  What's the replacement CPD code for this?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Sure, we can try out figuring out<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  that that should be used with the CPD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We will go ahead and attach the list of those ICDs<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  into the problem list.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  But still, you have to choose the most appropriate one  because we cannot go ahead and make it.  So we can just suggest to you for the ICD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The fact is that it's only for the New York State  to come from with the EMEG, the technique.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We've seen another code they're supposed to use.  And meanwhile, I will check with my team  if there would be any possibility  to get a list of the suggested ICD codes.  I will let you know that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Please.  Please.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I've noted that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The CPD code, the concerns will be the same.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  If you go ahead and obviously provide us  some resolution that will apply on all of these.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You're going to check that.  And also 916.  5916.  Let me see that.  They asked the insurance.  The insurance asked about the medical record for it.  Yeah.  If you all have a patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Patient.  Let me see.  There is no case being listed in the problem list.  But.  Oh, no.  The letter.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The letter is sent to our office.  And you say you're going to check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me just see that.  Just give me a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think that Anna has the problem too.  Not in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Well, I'm not sure if we have discussed this thing as well.  Because I'm not getting any data with this account  number in my record.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about again.  Because I knew that Anna, that the last meeting,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that two account number, even that's Anna 2.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And I was talking to the patient.  So I don't know that is the new word.  Putting it on our list.  Or you're going to check.  Yeah.  Please go ahead and check that.  I think that was for the July 21, 2023,  the visit record.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me just see the notes if there is any.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Oh, yes.  I remember that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, I got it.  I'm sorry.  So to the portal and 30 days to finalize.  So this is still in the process right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So you get the on the portal.  OK.  I think she said the little.  Yeah, that was you were talking about a 4948.  Yes.  I think that was Anna found that from the Medicare set.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  For the portal.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  For the portal, yeah.  Inpatient.  Yes.  From the March 24 to April 10.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  That's right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We don't know which hospital or somewhere.  We're guessing that it's probably in the rehab center.  Because the most rehab center, they  can send the patient to see any doctor.  They need to from the insurance and still show  that inpatient because they are in the rehab.  And the QMD, she has this experience.  Once this case, they are going to claim to that facility  to the rehab center.  And it's not a claim from our office.  And they're going to get the pay and they're  going to pay us back.  Something like that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So I sent the email to Anna as I mentioned earlier.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  But Anna did not respond to me with anything.  So if she has any updates on that<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  or she wants us to do something, please<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  ask her to reply to that email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  And we'll do that thing accordingly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  All right.  We got the denied claims.  And the patient was in the nursing home.  And our claims were denied by the insurance saying  that all the outpatient services should  be paid by the nursing home instead of the insurance.  Does it make sense to you?  That does not.  Because it's obviously through the portal,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that is information that is being shared with us as well.  And we don't know why insurance obviously has  this information in their records.  So because it's Medicare, they do not  provide a lot of information over the calls.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We do visit and this is what we got here,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that the patient was admitted in the hospital.  And so that is why the claim cannot be submitted at PUS 11<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  at the office location, even though we speak  because in our portal, the information<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  is showing something else.  Speak with Anna directly so we can be able to tell you.  Of course.  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Another thing is, Wendy, are you done?  OK.  So a couple of things.  One, for the EMG report, Wendy explained.  So we have the technician does the procedure.  And we have a neurologist who does the procedure as well,  but he will generate the current processes.  We have to print out his report, then Dr. Wang's review  and sign, and we have to attach the report back.  Is there a way that Dr. Wang can just sign it electronically?  For example, Yang Yang, our NP, who generates the report,  I don't know.  And Dr. Wang signs it and submit for claim.  How we do the same thing for the end?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I have to check that, and I will get back to you  with some answer on that.  Because for now, I can be very sure that either it<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  can be done or not.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  But let me just talk with our team  and see if there would be any possibility of doing that.  So you want to do it the same way as the other things have  been happening.  Your NP just creates the provider,  nor Dr. Wang just signs the e-super bill, and that's it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  But he had to sign off the EMT note.  OK, I will check it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  If there would be any possibility,  I will let you know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, sounds good.  And I just reviewed the report you sent me this morning.  It looks more realistic this time.  I haven't found anything funny yet,  but I will continue with you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm glad.  I'm glad for that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It looks much better.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Oh, finally.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank God.  Thank you.  And so Jerry, would you be able to provide  this monthly report then?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Of course, for the next month, moving ahead,  the same report will be shared with you,  having the real, accurate data.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, that would be great.  All right, so I don't have anything else.  Yeah, I guess we can wrap up the meeting.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So I do have a few things to say.  First thing is there is a patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We just got a call from a patient  negotiating with their bill.  And I sent that query to Anna, and she told me<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  she'll get back to me by the end of Friday.  And it's Monday, but I did not hear anything back from her.  So if you can just please ask her  to send me any updates for that patient as well, OK?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So which patient?  We have a video now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Of course.  The patient's account number is 57.  And I will let you know the name of that patient as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And one quick question here.  So I received a phone call from my mom.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  It is from Janice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And she has a patient referred by a new provider.  So it's kind of urgent.  This patient, I promised her to be seen on Wednesday  at 11 o'clock.  And she will email the patient information  to drwong at drwonguro.com.  You were talking about this Wednesday.  This Wednesday.  There's no procedure this Wednesday,  so we decided to move patients.  But another thing is Dr. Wong has two procedures on the 21st.  So he wants to move as many patients from 21st to the 20th,  as many as possible.  Yeah.  That's the year.  He will finish by two.  Yeah.  OK.  All right.  And also, Janice said, OK, her office  is calling us quite a few times, but nobody picked up a call.  I don't know which number they called,  but just make sure we answer their call.  Yeah, we have something.  When I was on the phone, I didn't pick up.  But the hospital number, I can see that.  I will pick up during the meeting we have.  But it's still only ring public twice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So we just kind of off.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  So this is something that happened to this phone too.  I think for some reason, they just ring two times.  Time is worse.  But the first time is worse.  Yeah.  I think it was the problem from the hour,  still from the hour on the visit.  Hopefully, we can fix the problem today.  Yes.  Please check this email, because another patient is  emailing us the medical records.  Yeah, I saw that.  That was a lot of medical records.  OK.  I just saw it.  It's a lot of medical records.  Perfect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  It's all done.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It's all done, right?  Yeah.  That's why you talk about a schedule only at 11.  Yeah.  OK.  OK.  OK.  Thank you, Jerry.  You can go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  No worries.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You want to show us?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  There is nothing to be showed, Young,  with an account number of 5790.  So there is a bill of $35 for 7-11-2023 date of service.  And the patient says that she has already paid the bill.  And she provided that was given to her by your office.  But that payment has not been posted into the system.  And there is no record of that payment into the system.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I just asked Anna, then let me<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  know if you guys received that payment so that we can go out  and post that payment, but apply for that patient.  If you guys can check that, I'd be really happy to give you  the more details.  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Did the patient say how he paid?  So what did he present you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me show you what he presented me.  Just give me a second.  Get anything from that payment proof?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I was like, OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  But this is something that the patient provided us.  So we're not sure if it was given by you guys.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Or I don't know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me know if you guys can screen the screen.  So, oh, sorry.  There is a payment date of credit.  And there is an amount of $35.  And this is prepared by 452.  So it means that obviously this print has  had to be taken from Care MD.  So obviously, someone from the office  gave this print to the patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, absolutely.  So I think since we have the receipt,  we definitely should make the correction.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So, OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Would you be able to?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Sorry, what?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Would you be able to make the correction?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yes, we can do that.  We'll just go ahead and post this payment against the data<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  service.  And that would be it.  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, thank you so much for that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And second thing is I just wanted<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  to discuss something regarding the portal of, let me search  the insurance, which was it.  So Anna is not in today, or is she just?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Sure, I don't know why she has trouble to log in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, so there is basically a portal request  for the MetroPlus health plan, which  has to be created from your side.  We have tried from our side, but it did not  allow us to create that portal.  So I mean, Wendy, if you use total or do you want?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Which portal, which one?  What the trial you said?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yes, MetroPlus health plan.  We have basically 42 claims that have been paid by the insurance.  And we do not have the EOBs.  And until we do not have the EOBs,  we cannot go ahead and post the payments, right?  So when we call the insurance to have the EOBs to the ERAs,  and we can get the EOBs or download the EOBs  from the portal and then post the payments.  So we have tried creating the portal, but it was asking.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We have this portal.  You guys have the portal?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Oh, if you guys have it, please.  We were ensured that if you guys do have the portal or not.  So if you guys have it, that's superb.  We'll just go ahead and log in and download the EOBs  from there.  And if you guys allow us, we can go ahead and obviously<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  post the payments for those claims that have been<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  paid already by the insurance.  I'm just trying to see if it works.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And I will send you the login information.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Of course, of course.  Because there are 42 claims.  So until we post them, they will still obviously  be showing in our panning bucket.  And that will obviously increase our task  that we have to post it and all that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, if it works.  Yeah, I emailed you this.  It will not be any information.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Don't pay or I'll tell you right now.  And if EOBs from the portal, can we  go ahead and just post the payments against those EOBs?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, you said you asked me to do that.  I can do that again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Well, we just have to have the approval from your side.  Obviously, that's the guideline that you guys have established  that we cannot post the payments until you guys confirm  us to do so.  So even though if you download the EOBs from the portal,  still to post the payments.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Do you have this with the time period?  Or if I search that, would the patient,  do you have the information which patient?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yes, I have a list of all the patients.  Do you want me to send it to you right now?  Yes, please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Send it to this doc1 at doc1ur.com.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, just give me a second.  Let me just make it password protected.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So you are not allowed to use our login, is that what you  said?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We did not have the login, basically.  We were trying to create a new portal.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That's what I'm asking you.  Do you want me to send you the login information?  You can go from our side.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  You just have to share the credentials.  And we can go ahead and log in from our end.  And we will have any possibility for that.  Just a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, so you send me the list and the question.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm just sending you right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I want to check on later.  I didn't receive it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Just so on.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Dr. Wong at doc1ur.com.  Got you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Sending you right away.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, this Wednesday, Dr. Wong is going to start what, 10 o'clock?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  To 11.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know when Yang Yang can be there.  As soon as Yang Yang can be there.  If it's 11, I'm not able to move too many patients.  I tried 10.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So I've sent it to you.  Please check your email.  And if you have the credentials for that portal,  just share that with me.  Yes, please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Give me one second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So if you have to get some more time to check.  Hi, Wendy, can you hear me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, I can hear you.  Oh, OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I think I lost you guys.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I was saying if you guys need to,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  and you can share the credentials later<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  with me after the meeting.  Yeah, I'm going to call.  OK.  Sorry, I was distracted.  What's this issue is about?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  This was for the MetroPlus claims for the portal.  Oh, true.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I see, I see.  Do you need to provide information to Wendy,  or Wendy needs to provide information to you?  Actually, I was telling that we need<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  to create a new portal for the MetroPlus.  And Wendy told me that you guys already  have the portal for MetroPlus.  The credentials, the username, and the password to me.  And we can log in and download the EOBs from there.  And then post the payments accordingly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  I will let Wendy ask you any, Wendy to send you the information.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I think I'm done for the day as well.  If you guys do have any other information or any concerns,  just let me know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So do we have to wait for Wendy for now, or we're good to go?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No, I think we're good for now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  All right, so Erin, hopefully, see you on next Monday.  And have a good day.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm sorry.  Oh, yeah, Wendy's here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Finally.  I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I would just get a phone call from the patient.  OK.  Yeah.  Sorry, I missed something.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So Wendy, I was just saying, if you need some more time  to look at the details for the report, you can just do that.  And it will be right after the meeting as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So that's OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  I just look at it.  I get the report.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'll go over back to you.  Of that portal as well?  And there will be any security questions or something<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  you have?  I'm doing that now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, great.  Thank you so much for your time, guys.  Have a good day.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All right.  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Bye.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  See you next week.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Bye bye.<br>",,"<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  to enable audio control.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Hey, Erin, can you hear me now?  Good morning, everyone.  I'm not sure if Erin, can you hear me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I can hear you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, that's good.  So do we have to wait for Anna?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All right, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So first of all, Erin, I have sent you the updated reports  today.  Did you check that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No.  Can you show me?  Which one updated reports?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  For the one where the duplicates were showing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I see.  No, I didn't get a chance to get.  OK, you can review that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I did verify from my end as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I didn't find any duplicate.  But just in case, if I miss something,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  you can just let me know.  But I'm sure that there won't be any.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That's wonderful.  OK.  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me see.  Hello?  Can you hear me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  Yeah, I'll just try the second time.  The first time I can't hear it, the speaker doesn't work.  All right, now it's fine.  How are you?  I'm very good.  Well, thank you.  Jerry?  Yeah?  OK.  Good.  OK.  So, Wani, you can go and review what you have with Jerry.  And I'm going to look at the report he sent me.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm just reading from your side if you have any questions.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Just let's just start.  All right.  I have one that's on the problem list.  One asks about the medical record.  OK.  Let me tell you that it was account number 5818.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Once again, 5818.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  I'm assuming the insurance asked.  It was your team said they need a doctor to sign up.  Actually, the EMG report, because I  have another technician doing the EMG and another neurology,  the doctor to guide the report.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So that's one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I didn't sign.  So I'm assuming that you can just send this.  Actually, I confirmed with him this morning.  He said he will check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  First of all, did we get a denial  from the insurance for this service or like what?  So just give me a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Sure.  Yeah.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So the letter that have been attached in the problem list  that has been sent to you guys to have it signed  from the doctor.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And because if you see that letter,  it's from the insurance and states<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  that it should have the signature for the provider</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So once we have that medical records,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  including the signature of the provider,  we can go out and obviously submit the claim<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  to the insurance again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm sure there would be some scenarios where obviously<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  insurance might ask for some kind of information<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  depending on some insurance's plans or something.  So you need the signature, even this electronic signature.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It could be electronically.  Just scan us again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  That medical records up to you guys.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Actually, that's the document.  So the EMGs always send it.  That's one.  Yeah, the document, the patient's document has the EMG.  Look at the EMG.  They have two.  And this one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So you are talking about the report  that is uploaded on 7-29?  Oh, sorry.  7-21-1523.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I have two EMGs.  One is on July 15th.  One on the July 9th.  I think it's one her.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Well, it would be good if we can get the signed document  for the one that we have attached.  And the problem is because there could be a possibility<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  that insurance only requires those letters<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  to be authorized from the provider, not any other ones.  So it is better if you submit the same thing  that insurance has requested us in order  to obviously get a denial and then we have  to reprocess the claim again.  Just a note.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Dr. Walsman, if you open that file.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, I'm just looking at that.  I am just looking at that.  487-29 and 7-14.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, the first page you can see that left,  it was another neurologist.  He's doing that on the right side of Dr. Walsman.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, well, I will have it checked with our team one more time.  And if there would be any possibility  that we can submit these letters to the insurance,  we will obviously go out and do that.  If not, then I will let Anna know, or you,  so that you have to sign those letters which have been  attached in the problem list.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK?  OK, all right.  So try to do this.  I think that was also the way that the office,  the way that the note media is set.  By this tension, I couldn't find the most of that.  I can see that the request for the notes  for the medical records on the United  United Healthcare, but this tension,  I couldn't find even the claims number or anything  that doesn't show anything.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, I will check with the team and we'll let you guys know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, please check that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  And so any other thing from your side?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think I gave it to Anna.  I don't know that they got it resolved already.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  It's account number 4700EGC9.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And we'll talk about that from the last view.  We just open that up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  No, this wasn't the patient that we  discussed in the last meeting.  I think so that was some other patient.  It wasn't discussed in the last meeting.  I'm sorry.  We did not have any discussion on this patient  in the last meeting.  I think because that was most probably some other concern.  If I look on the problem list for this patient,  that's a separate concern.  So it's a different patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No, if you look at the patient, I  think with the last meeting, we're  talking about cost that we received  the insurance matter, B9.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me just check my email.  I just sent the response to Anna the second day of the meeting.  Let me just pull up that email.  Just give me a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Hey, hey, Jerry.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the one we're talking about.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Patient that was discussed in the last meeting  is a call number 4948.  And I sent an email to Anna as well with the update<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  on that patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So that was not the same patient that you<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  are talking about right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  There was 4948 and this is 4700.  Yeah, it's a different one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm talking about the 4700.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So what questions do you have for this patient?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  This patient, we received the letter from the insurance.  That was the EET study.  That is patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We uploaded the insurance letter on this patient's letter.  Do you, can you specify any specific date of service<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  you're talking about?  It's both the same 2020.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, December 2020, 2022.  2022, I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So if you go to the problem list,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  the same concern has been added to the problem list.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  For that, partially paid the claim,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  but denied the CPD code 95, 9570 to the ICD issue  because the reported ICDs are not payable with CPD codes.  And according to CMS guidelines, their previously submitted  request for it's insist on the correct ICD code.  So here we just want to have the correct ICD code for the CPD  code used 95, 957.  R55, V89.2, and F17.200 are not payable with this CPD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So this is something that you guys have to check<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  and let us know that what should be the appropriate ICD  for the CPD code so that we can obviously  go out and resubmit the claim with the correct ICD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, so this code, and also we have another,  I think it's one or two pages, has the same issue  under the problem list now.  OK.  With about this code, it's 95, only for the valid.  It's the issue for the.  Yes.  Yes, only for the valid.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, that's right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So is it possible you guys can find that?  What's the replacement CPD code for this?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Sure, we can try out figuring out<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  that that should be used with the CPD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We will go ahead and attach the list of those ICDs<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  into the problem list.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  But still, you have to choose the most appropriate one  because we cannot go ahead and make it.  So we can just suggest to you for the ICD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The fact is that it's only for the New York State  to come from with the EMEG, the technique.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We've seen another code they're supposed to use.  And meanwhile, I will check with my team  if there would be any possibility  to get a list of the suggested ICD codes.  I will let you know that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Please.  Please.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I've noted that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The CPD code, the concerns will be the same.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  If you go ahead and obviously provide us  some resolution that will apply on all of these.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You're going to check that.  And also 916.  5916.  Let me see that.  They asked the insurance.  The insurance asked about the medical record for it.  Yeah.  If you all have a patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Patient.  Let me see.  There is no case being listed in the problem list.  But.  Oh, no.  The letter.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The letter is sent to our office.  And you say you're going to check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me just see that.  Just give me a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think that Anna has the problem too.  Not in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Well, I'm not sure if we have discussed this thing as well.  Because I'm not getting any data with this account  number in my record.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about again.  Because I knew that Anna, that the last meeting,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that two account number, even that's Anna 2.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And I was talking to the patient.  So I don't know that is the new word.  Putting it on our list.  Or you're going to check.  Yeah.  Please go ahead and check that.  I think that was for the July 21, 2023,  the visit record.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me just see the notes if there is any.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Oh, yes.  I remember that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, I got it.  I'm sorry.  So to the portal and 30 days to finalize.  So this is still in the process right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So you get the on the portal.  OK.  I think she said the little.  Yeah, that was you were talking about a 4948.  Yes.  I think that was Anna found that from the Medicare set.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  For the portal.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  For the portal, yeah.  Inpatient.  Yes.  From the March 24 to April 10.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  That's right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We don't know which hospital or somewhere.  We're guessing that it's probably in the rehab center.  Because the most rehab center, they  can send the patient to see any doctor.  They need to from the insurance and still show  that inpatient because they are in the rehab.  And the QMD, she has this experience.  Once this case, they are going to claim to that facility  to the rehab center.  And it's not a claim from our office.  And they're going to get the pay and they're  going to pay us back.  Something like that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So I sent the email to Anna as I mentioned earlier.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  But Anna did not respond to me with anything.  So if she has any updates on that<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  or she wants us to do something, please<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  ask her to reply to that email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  And we'll do that thing accordingly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  All right.  We got the denied claims.  And the patient was in the nursing home.  And our claims were denied by the insurance saying  that all the outpatient services should  be paid by the nursing home instead of the insurance.  Does it make sense to you?  That does not.  Because it's obviously through the portal,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that is information that is being shared with us as well.  And we don't know why insurance obviously has  this information in their records.  So because it's Medicare, they do not  provide a lot of information over the calls.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We do visit and this is what we got here,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that the patient was admitted in the hospital.  And so that is why the claim cannot be submitted at PUS 11<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  at the office location, even though we speak  because in our portal, the information</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  is showing something else.  Speak with Anna directly so we can be able to tell you.  Of course.  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Another thing is, Wendy, are you done?  OK.  So a couple of things.  One, for the EMG report, Wendy explained.  So we have the technician does the procedure.  And we have a neurologist who does the procedure as well,  but he will generate the current processes.  We have to print out his report, then Dr. Wang's review  and sign, and we have to attach the report back.  Is there a way that Dr. Wang can just sign it electronically?  For example, Yang Yang, our NP, who generates the report,  I don't know.  And Dr. Wang signs it and submit for claim.  How we do the same thing for the end?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I have to check that, and I will get back to you  with some answer on that.  Because for now, I can be very sure that either it<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  can be done or not.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  But let me just talk with our team  and see if there would be any possibility of doing that.  So you want to do it the same way as the other things have  been happening.  Your NP just creates the provider,  nor Dr. Wang just signs the e-super bill, and that's it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  But he had to sign off the EMT note.  OK, I will check it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  If there would be any possibility,  I will let you know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, sounds good.  And I just reviewed the report you sent me this morning.  It looks more realistic this time.  I haven't found anything funny yet,  but I will continue with you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm glad.  I'm glad for that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It looks much better.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Oh, finally.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank God.  Thank you.  And so Jerry, would you be able to provide  this monthly report then?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Of course, for the next month, moving ahead,  the same report will be shared with you,  having the real, accurate data.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, that would be great.  All right, so I don't have anything else.  Yeah, I guess we can wrap up the meeting.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So I do have a few things to say.  First thing is there is a patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We just got a call from a patient  negotiating with their bill.  And I sent that query to Anna, and she told me<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  she'll get back to me by the end of Friday.  And it's Monday, but I did not hear anything back from her.  So if you can just please ask her  to send me any updates for that patient as well, OK?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So which patient?  We have a video now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Of course.  The patient's account number is 57.  And I will let you know the name of that patient as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And one quick question here.  So I received a phone call from my mom.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  It is from Janice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And she has a patient referred by a new provider.  So it's kind of urgent.  This patient, I promised her to be seen on Wednesday  at 11 o'clock.  And she will email the patient information  to drwong at drwonguro.com.  You were talking about this Wednesday.  This Wednesday.  There's no procedure this Wednesday,  so we decided to move patients.  But another thing is Dr. Wong has two procedures on the 21st.  So he wants to move as many patients from 21st to the 20th,  as many as possible.  Yeah.  That's the year.  He will finish by two.  Yeah.  OK.  All right.  And also, Janice said, OK, her office  is calling us quite a few times, but nobody picked up a call.  I don't know which number they called,  but just make sure we answer their call.  Yeah, we have something.  When I was on the phone, I didn't pick up.  But the hospital number, I can see that.  I will pick up during the meeting we have.  But it's still only ring public twice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So we just kind of off.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  So this is something that happened to this phone too.  I think for some reason, they just ring two times.  Time is worse.  But the first time is worse.  Yeah.  I think it was the problem from the hour,  still from the hour on the visit.  Hopefully, we can fix the problem today.  Yes.  Please check this email, because another patient is  emailing us the medical records.  Yeah, I saw that.  That was a lot of medical records.  OK.  I just saw it.  It's a lot of medical records.  Perfect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  It's all done.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It's all done, right?  Yeah.  That's why you talk about a schedule only at 11.  Yeah.  OK.  OK.  OK.  Thank you, Jerry.  You can go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  No worries.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You want to show us?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  There is nothing to be showed, Young,  with an account number of 5790.  So there is a bill of $35 for 7-11-2023 date of service.  And the patient says that she has already paid the bill.  And she provided that was given to her by your office.  But that payment has not been posted into the system.  And there is no record of that payment into the system.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I just asked Anna, then let me<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  know if you guys received that payment so that we can go out  and post that payment, but apply for that patient.  If you guys can check that, I'd be really happy to give you  the more details.  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Did the patient say how he paid?  So what did he present you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me show you what he presented me.  Just give me a second.  Get anything from that payment proof?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I was like, OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  But this is something that the patient provided us.  So we're not sure if it was given by you guys.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Or I don't know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me know if you guys can screen the screen.  So, oh, sorry.  There is a payment date of credit.  And there is an amount of $35.  And this is prepared by 452.  So it means that obviously this print has  had to be taken from Care MD.  So obviously, someone from the office  gave this print to the patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, absolutely.  So I think since we have the receipt,  we definitely should make the correction.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So, OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Would you be able to?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Sorry, what?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Would you be able to make the correction?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yes, we can do that.  We'll just go ahead and post this payment against the data<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  service.  And that would be it.  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, thank you so much for that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And second thing is I just wanted<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  to discuss something regarding the portal of, let me search  the insurance, which was it.  So Anna is not in today, or is she just?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Sure, I don't know why she has trouble to log in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, so there is basically a portal request  for the MetroPlus health plan, which  has to be created from your side.  We have tried from our side, but it did not  allow us to create that portal.  So I mean, Wendy, if you use total or do you want?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Which portal, which one?  What the trial you said?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yes, MetroPlus health plan.  We have basically 42 claims that have been paid by the insurance.  And we do not have the EOBs.  And until we do not have the EOBs,  we cannot go ahead and post the payments, right?  So when we call the insurance to have the EOBs to the ERAs,  and we can get the EOBs or download the EOBs  from the portal and then post the payments.  So we have tried creating the portal, but it was asking.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We have this portal.  You guys have the portal?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Oh, if you guys have it, please.  We were ensured that if you guys do have the portal or not.  So if you guys have it, that's superb.  We'll just go ahead and log in and download the EOBs  from there.  And if you guys allow us, we can go ahead and obviously<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  post the payments for those claims that have been<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  paid already by the insurance.  I'm just trying to see if it works.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And I will send you the login information.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Of course, of course.  Because there are 42 claims.  So until we post them, they will still obviously  be showing in our panning bucket.  And that will obviously increase our task  that we have to post it and all that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, if it works.  Yeah, I emailed you this.  It will not be any information.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Don't pay or I'll tell you right now.  And if EOBs from the portal, can we  go ahead and just post the payments against those EOBs?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, you said you asked me to do that.  I can do that again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Well, we just have to have the approval from your side.  Obviously, that's the guideline that you guys have established  that we cannot post the payments until you guys confirm  us to do so.  So even though if you download the EOBs from the portal,  still to post the payments.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Do you have this with the time period?  Or if I search that, would the patient,  do you have the information which patient?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yes, I have a list of all the patients.  Do you want me to send it to you right now?  Yes, please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Send it to this doc1 at doc1ur.com.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, just give me a second.  Let me just make it password protected.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So you are not allowed to use our login, is that what you  said?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We did not have the login, basically.  We were trying to create a new portal.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That's what I'm asking you.  Do you want me to send you the login information?  You can go from our side.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  You just have to share the credentials.  And we can go ahead and log in from our end.  And we will have any possibility for that.  Just a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, so you send me the list and the question.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm just sending you right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I want to check on later.  I didn't receive it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Just so on.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Dr. Wong at doc1ur.com.  Got you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Sending you right away.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, this Wednesday, Dr. Wong is going to start what, 10 o'clock?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  To 11.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know when Yang Yang can be there.  As soon as Yang Yang can be there.  If it's 11, I'm not able to move too many patients.  I tried 10.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So I've sent it to you.  Please check your email.  And if you have the credentials for that portal,  just share that with me.  Yes, please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Give me one second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So if you have to get some more time to check.  Hi, Wendy, can you hear me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, I can hear you.  Oh, OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I think I lost you guys.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I was saying if you guys need to,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  and you can share the credentials later<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  with me after the meeting.  Yeah, I'm going to call.  OK.  Sorry, I was distracted.  What's this issue is about?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  This was for the MetroPlus claims for the portal.  Oh, true.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I see, I see.  Do you need to provide information to Wendy,  or Wendy needs to provide information to you?  Actually, I was telling that we need<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  to create a new portal for the MetroPlus.  And Wendy told me that you guys already  have the portal for MetroPlus.  The credentials, the username, and the password to me.  And we can log in and download the EOBs from there.  And then post the payments accordingly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  I will let Wendy ask you any, Wendy to send you the information.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I think I'm done for the day as well.  If you guys do have any other information or any concerns,  just let me know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So do we have to wait for Wendy for now, or we're good to go?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No, I think we're good for now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  All right, so Erin, hopefully, see you on next Monday.  And have a good day.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm sorry.  Oh, yeah, Wendy's here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Finally.  I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I would just get a phone call from the patient.  OK.  Yeah.  Sorry, I missed something.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So Wendy, I was just saying, if you need some more time  to look at the details for the report, you can just do that.  And it will be right after the meeting as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So that's OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  I just look at it.  I get the report.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'll go over back to you.  Of that portal as well?  And there will be any security questions or something<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  you have?  I'm doing that now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, great.  Thank you so much for your time, guys.  Have a good day.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All right.  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Bye.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  See you next week.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Bye bye.<br>","<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  to enable audio control.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Hey, Erin, can you hear me now?  Good morning, everyone.  I'm not sure if Erin, can you hear me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I can hear you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, that's good.  So do we have to wait for Anna?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All right, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So first of all, Erin, I have sent you the updated reports  today.  Did you check that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No.  Can you show me?  Which one updated reports?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  For the one where the duplicates were showing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I see.  No, I didn't get a chance to get.  OK, you can review that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I did verify from my end as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I didn't find any duplicate.  But just in case, if I miss something,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  you can just let me know.  But I'm sure that there won't be any.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That's wonderful.  OK.  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me see.  Hello?  Can you hear me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  Yeah, I'll just try the second time.  The first time I can't hear it, the speaker doesn't work.  All right, now it's fine.  How are you?  I'm very good.  Well, thank you.  Jerry?  Yeah?  OK.  Good.  OK.  So, Wani, you can go and review what you have with Jerry.  And I'm going to look at the report he sent me.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm just reading from your side if you have any questions.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Just let's just start.  All right.  I have one that's on the problem list.  One asks about the medical record.  OK.  Let me tell you that it was account number 5818.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Once again, 5818.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  I'm assuming the insurance asked.  It was your team said they need a doctor to sign up.  Actually, the EMG report, because I  have another technician doing the EMG and another neurology,  the doctor to guide the report.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So that's one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I didn't sign.  So I'm assuming that you can just send this.  Actually, I confirmed with him this morning.  He said he will check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  First of all, did we get a denial  from the insurance for this service or like what?  So just give me a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Sure.  Yeah.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So the letter that have been attached in the problem list  that has been sent to you guys to have it signed  from the doctor.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And because if you see that letter,  it's from the insurance and states<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that it should have the signature for the provider.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So once we have that medical records,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  including the signature of the provider,  we can go out and obviously submit the claim<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  to the insurance again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm sure there would be some scenarios where obviously<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  insurance might ask for some kind of information<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  depending on some insurance's plans or something.  So you need the signature, even this electronic signature.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It could be electronically.  Just scan us again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  That medical records up to you guys.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Actually, that's the document.  So the EMGs always send it.  That's one.  Yeah, the document, the patient's document has the EMG.  Look at the EMG.  They have two.  And this one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So you are talking about the report  that is uploaded on 7-29?  Oh, sorry.  7-21-1523.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I have two EMGs.  One is on July 15th.  One on the July 9th.  I think it's one her.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Well, it would be good if we can get the signed document  for the one that we have attached.  And the problem is because there could be a possibility<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  that insurance only requires those letters<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  to be authorized from the provider, not any other ones.  So it is better if you submit the same thing  that insurance has requested us in order  to obviously get a denial and then we have  to reprocess the claim again.  Just a note.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Dr. Walsman, if you open that file.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, I'm just looking at that.  I am just looking at that.  487-29 and 7-14.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, the first page you can see that left,  it was another neurologist.  He's doing that on the right side of Dr. Walsman.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, well, I will have it checked with our team one more time.  And if there would be any possibility  that we can submit these letters to the insurance,  we will obviously go out and do that.  If not, then I will let Anna know, or you,  so that you have to sign those letters which have been  attached in the problem list.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK?  OK, all right.  So try to do this.  I think that was also the way that the office,  the way that the note media is set.  By this tension, I couldn't find the most of that. <span style=""color:red""><b>  I can see that the request for the notes  for the medical records on the United  United Healthcare, but this tension,  I couldn't find even the claims number or anything  that doesn't show anything</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, I will check with the team and we'll let you guys know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, please check that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  And so any other thing from your side?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think I gave it to Anna.  I don't know that they got it resolved already.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  It's account number 4700EGC9.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And we'll talk about that from the last view.  We just open that up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  No, this wasn't the patient that we  discussed in the last meeting.  I think so that was some other patient.  It wasn't discussed in the last meeting.  I'm sorry.  We did not have any discussion on this patient  in the last meeting.  I think because that was most probably some other concern.  If I look on the problem list for this patient,  that's a separate concern.  So it's a different patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No, if you look at the patient, I  think with the last meeting, we're  talking about cost that we received  the insurance matter, B9.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me just check my email.  I just sent the response to Anna the second day of the meeting.  Let me just pull up that email.  Just give me a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Hey, hey, Jerry.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the one we're talking about.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Patient that was discussed in the last meeting  is a call number 4948.  And I sent an email to Anna as well with the update<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  on that patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So that was not the same patient that you<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  are talking about right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  There was 4948 and this is 4700.  Yeah, it's a different one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm talking about the 4700.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So what questions do you have for this patient?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  This patient, we received the letter from the insurance.  That was the EET study.  That is patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We uploaded the insurance letter on this patient's letter.  Do you, can you specify any specific date of service<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  you're talking about?  It's both the same 2020.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, December 2020, 2022.  2022, I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So if you go to the problem list,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  the same concern has been added to the problem list.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  For that, partially paid the claim,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  but denied the CPD code 95, 9570 to the ICD issue  because the reported ICDs are not payable with CPD codes.  And according to CMS guidelines, their previously submitted  request for it's insist on the correct ICD code.  So here we just want to have the correct ICD code for the CPD  code used 95, 957.  R55, V89.2, and F17.200 are not payable with this CPD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So this is something that you guys have to check<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  and let us know that what should be the appropriate ICD  for the CPD code so that we can obviously  go out and resubmit the claim with the correct ICD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, so this code, and also we have another,  I think it's one or two pages, has the same issue  under the problem list now.  OK.  With about this code, it's 95, only for the valid.  It's the issue for the.  Yes.  Yes, only for the valid.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, that's right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So is it possible you guys can find that?  What's the replacement CPD code for this?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Sure, we can try out figuring out<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  that that should be used with the CPD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We will go ahead and attach the list of those ICDs<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  into the problem list.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  But still, you have to choose the most appropriate one  because we cannot go ahead and make it.  So we can just suggest to you for the ICD code.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The fact is that it's only for the New York State  to come from with the EMEG, the technique.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We've seen another code they're supposed to use.  And meanwhile, I will check with my team  if there would be any possibility  to get a list of the suggested ICD codes.  I will let you know that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Please.  Please.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I've noted that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The CPD code, the concerns will be the same.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  If you go ahead and obviously provide us  some resolution that will apply on all of these.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You're going to check that.  And also 916.  5916.  Let me see that.  They asked the insurance.  The insurance asked about the medical record for it.  Yeah.  If you all have a patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Patient.  Let me see.  There is no case being listed in the problem list.  But.  Oh, no.  The letter.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  The letter is sent to our office.  And you say you're going to check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me just see that.  Just give me a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think that Anna has the problem too.  Not in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Well, I'm not sure if we have discussed this thing as well.  Because I'm not getting any data with this account  number in my record.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about again.  Because I knew that Anna, that the last meeting,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that two account number, even that's Anna 2.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And I was talking to the patient.  So I don't know that is the new word.  Putting it on our list.  Or you're going to check.  Yeah.  Please go ahead and check that.  I think that was for the July 21, 2023,  the visit record.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me just see the notes if there is any.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Oh, yes.  I remember that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yeah, I got it.  I'm sorry.  So to the portal and 30 days to finalize.  So this is still in the process right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So you get the on the portal.  OK.  I think she said the little.  Yeah, that was you were talking about a 4948.  Yes.  I think that was Anna found that from the Medicare set.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  For the portal.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  For the portal, yeah.  Inpatient.  Yes.  From the March 24 to April 10.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  That's right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We don't know which hospital or somewhere.  We're guessing that it's probably in the rehab center.  Because the most rehab center, they  can send the patient to see any doctor.  They need to from the insurance and still show  that inpatient because they are in the rehab.  And the QMD, she has this experience.  Once this case, they are going to claim to that facility  to the rehab center.  And it's not a claim from our office.  And they're going to get the pay and they're  going to pay us back.  Something like that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So I sent the email to Anna as I mentioned earlier.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  But Anna did not respond to me with anything.  So if she has any updates on that<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  or she wants us to do something, please<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  ask her to reply to that email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  And we'll do that thing accordingly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  All right.  We got the denied claims.  And the patient was in the nursing home.  And our claims were denied by the insurance saying  that all the outpatient services should  be paid by the nursing home instead of the insurance.  Does it make sense to you?  That does not.  Because it's obviously through the portal,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that is information that is being shared with us as well.  And we don't know why insurance obviously has  this information in their records.  So because it's Medicare, they do not  provide a lot of information over the calls.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We do visit and this is what we got here,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  that the patient was admitted in the hospital.  And so that is why the claim cannot be submitted at PUS 11<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  at the office location, even though we speak  because in our portal, the information<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  is showing something else.  Speak with Anna directly so we can be able to tell you.  Of course.  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Another thing is, Wendy, are you done?  OK.  So a couple of things.  One, for the EMG report, Wendy explained.  So we have the technician does the procedure.  And we have a neurologist who does the procedure as well,  but he will generate the current processes.  We have to print out his report, then Dr. Wang's review  and sign, and we have to attach the report back.  Is there a way that Dr. Wang can just sign it electronically?  For example, Yang Yang, our NP, who generates the report,  I don't know.  And Dr. Wang signs it and submit for claim.  How we do the same thing for the end?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I have to check that, and I will get back to you  with some answer on that.  Because for now, I can be very sure that either it<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  can be done or not.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  But let me just talk with our team  and see if there would be any possibility of doing that.  So you want to do it the same way as the other things have  been happening.  Your NP just creates the provider,  nor Dr. Wang just signs the e-super bill, and that's it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  But he had to sign off the EMT note.  OK, I will check it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  If there would be any possibility,  I will let you know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, sounds good.  And I just reviewed the report you sent me this morning.  It looks more realistic this time.  I haven't found anything funny yet,  but I will continue with you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm glad.  I'm glad for that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It looks much better.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Oh, finally.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank God.  Thank you.  And so Jerry, would you be able to provide  this monthly report then?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Of course, for the next month, moving ahead,  the same report will be shared with you,  having the real, accurate data.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, that would be great.  All right, so I don't have anything else.  Yeah, I guess we can wrap up the meeting.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So I do have a few things to say.  First thing is there is a patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We just got a call from a patient  negotiating with their bill.  And I sent that query to Anna, and she told me<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  she'll get back to me by the end of Friday.  And it's Monday, but I did not hear anything back from her.  So if you can just please ask her  to send me any updates for that patient as well, OK?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So which patient?  We have a video now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Of course.  The patient's account number is 57.  And I will let you know the name of that patient as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And one quick question here.  So I received a phone call from my mom.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  It is from Janice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And she has a patient referred by a new provider.  So it's kind of urgent.  This patient, I promised her to be seen on Wednesday  at 11 o'clock.  And she will email the patient information  to drwong at drwonguro.com.  You were talking about this Wednesday.  This Wednesday.  There's no procedure this Wednesday,  so we decided to move patients.  But another thing is Dr. Wong has two procedures on the 21st.  So he wants to move as many patients from 21st to the 20th,  as many as possible.  Yeah.  That's the year.  He will finish by two.  Yeah.  OK.  All right.  And also, Janice said, OK, her office  is calling us quite a few times, but nobody picked up a call.  I don't know which number they called,  but just make sure we answer their call.  Yeah, we have something.  When I was on the phone, I didn't pick up.  But the hospital number, I can see that.  I will pick up during the meeting we have.  But it's still only ring public twice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So we just kind of off.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  So this is something that happened to this phone too.  I think for some reason, they just ring two times.  Time is worse.  But the first time is worse.  Yeah.  I think it was the problem from the hour,  still from the hour on the visit.  Hopefully, we can fix the problem today.  Yes.  Please check this email, because another patient is  emailing us the medical records.  Yeah, I saw that.  That was a lot of medical records.  OK.  I just saw it.  It's a lot of medical records.  Perfect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  It's all done.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It's all done, right?  Yeah.  That's why you talk about a schedule only at 11.  Yeah.  OK.  OK.  OK.  Thank you, Jerry.  You can go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  No worries.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  You want to show us?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  There is nothing to be showed, Young,  with an account number of 5790.  So there is a bill of $35 for 7-11-2023 date of service.  And the patient says that she has already paid the bill.  And she provided that was given to her by your office.  But that payment has not been posted into the system.  And there is no record of that payment into the system.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I just asked Anna, then let me<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  know if you guys received that payment so that we can go out  and post that payment, but apply for that patient.  If you guys can check that, I'd be really happy to give you  the more details.  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Did the patient say how he paid?  So what did he present you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me show you what he presented me.  Just give me a second.  Get anything from that payment proof?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I was like, OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  But this is something that the patient provided us.  So we're not sure if it was given by you guys.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Or I don't know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Let me know if you guys can screen the screen.  So, oh, sorry.  There is a payment date of credit.  And there is an amount of $35.  And this is prepared by 452.  So it means that obviously this print has  had to be taken from Care MD.  So obviously, someone from the office  gave this print to the patient.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, absolutely.  So I think since we have the receipt,  we definitely should make the correction.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So, OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Would you be able to?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Sorry, what?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Would you be able to make the correction?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yes, we can do that.  We'll just go ahead and post this payment against the data<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  service.  And that would be it.  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, thank you so much for that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And second thing is I just wanted<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  to discuss something regarding the portal of, let me search  the insurance, which was it.  So Anna is not in today, or is she just?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Sure, I don't know why she has trouble to log in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, so there is basically a portal request  for the MetroPlus health plan, which  has to be created from your side.  We have tried from our side, but it did not  allow us to create that portal.  So I mean, Wendy, if you use total or do you want?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Which portal, which one?  What the trial you said?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yes, MetroPlus health plan.  We have basically 42 claims that have been paid by the insurance.  And we do not have the EOBs.  And until we do not have the EOBs,  we cannot go ahead and post the payments, right?  So when we call the insurance to have the EOBs to the ERAs,  and we can get the EOBs or download the EOBs  from the portal and then post the payments.  So we have tried creating the portal, but it was asking.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We have this portal.  You guys have the portal?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Oh, if you guys have it, please.  We were ensured that if you guys do have the portal or not.  So if you guys have it, that's superb.  We'll just go ahead and log in and download the EOBs  from there.  And if you guys allow us, we can go ahead and obviously<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  post the payments for those claims that have been<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  paid already by the insurance.  I'm just trying to see if it works.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And I will send you the login information.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Of course, of course.  Because there are 42 claims.  So until we post them, they will still obviously  be showing in our panning bucket.  And that will obviously increase our task  that we have to post it and all that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, if it works.  Yeah, I emailed you this.  It will not be any information.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Don't pay or I'll tell you right now.  And if EOBs from the portal, can we  go ahead and just post the payments against those EOBs?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, you said you asked me to do that.  I can do that again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Well, we just have to have the approval from your side.  Obviously, that's the guideline that you guys have established  that we cannot post the payments until you guys confirm  us to do so.  So even though if you download the EOBs from the portal,  still to post the payments.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Do you have this with the time period?  Or if I search that, would the patient,  do you have the information which patient?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Yes, I have a list of all the patients.  Do you want me to send it to you right now?  Yes, please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Send it to this doc1 at doc1ur.com.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, just give me a second.  Let me just make it password protected.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So you are not allowed to use our login, is that what you  said?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  We did not have the login, basically.  We were trying to create a new portal.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That's what I'm asking you.  Do you want me to send you the login information?  You can go from our side.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  You just have to share the credentials.  And we can go ahead and log in from our end.  And we will have any possibility for that.  Just a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK, so you send me the list and the question.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm just sending you right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I want to check on later.  I didn't receive it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Just so on.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Dr. Wong at doc1ur.com.  Got you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Sending you right away.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh, this Wednesday, Dr. Wong is going to start what, 10 o'clock?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  To 11.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know when Yang Yang can be there.  As soon as Yang Yang can be there.  If it's 11, I'm not able to move too many patients.  I tried 10.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So I've sent it to you.  Please check your email.  And if you have the credentials for that portal,  just share that with me.  Yes, please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Give me one second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So if you have to get some more time to check.  Hi, Wendy, can you hear me?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, I can hear you.  Oh, OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I think I lost you guys.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So I was saying if you guys need to,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  and you can share the credentials later<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  with me after the meeting.  Yeah, I'm going to call.  OK.  Sorry, I was distracted.  What's this issue is about?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  This was for the MetroPlus claims for the portal.  Oh, true.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I see, I see.  Do you need to provide information to Wendy,  or Wendy needs to provide information to you?  Actually, I was telling that we need<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  to create a new portal for the MetroPlus.  And Wendy told me that you guys already  have the portal for MetroPlus.  The credentials, the username, and the password to me.  And we can log in and download the EOBs from there.  And then post the payments accordingly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  I will let Wendy ask you any, Wendy to send you the information.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I think I'm done for the day as well.  If you guys do have any other information or any concerns,  just let me know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So do we have to wait for Wendy for now, or we're good to go?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No, I think we're good for now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  All right, so Erin, hopefully, see you on next Monday.  And have a good day.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'm sorry.  Oh, yeah, Wendy's here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Finally.  I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I would just get a phone call from the patient.  OK.  Yeah.  Sorry, I missed something.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So Wendy, I was just saying, if you need some more time  to look at the details for the report, you can just do that.  And it will be right after the meeting as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  So that's OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  I just look at it.  I get the report.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  I'll go over back to you.  Of that portal as well?  And there will be any security questions or something<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  you have?  I'm doing that now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  OK, great.  Thank you so much for your time, guys.  Have a good day.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  All right.  Thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Bye.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  See you next week.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Jerry Green</span></b>:  Bye bye.<br>"

Because for CURE, so I'm fixing the template, so I'm not able to go in under settings, it's not there, it's missing.  Okay, okay. So they gave me access in my, the physician I'm working with in the office, sent in something and gave me access more than once.  But it keeps coming back with it. Alright.

Got it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Finn Adams</span></b>:  And then you will see four boxes, laboratory, lab profile, codes, and interface.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Go to code.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Finn Adams</span></b>:  In code, you have four options available, search, add, import, and map.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Click on add.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Finn Adams</span></b>:  And then you will see a couple of options, code and name.  In the code section, you will enter the number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And after test, you can press save.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Finn Adams</span></b>:  The code will be added.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Fantastic.  That's brilliant.  And do you, what about the CPT code?  I see that down there too.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Finn Adams</span></b>:  Actually, it's the mapping of CPT code super bill.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So we wanna add the CPT code as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Finn Adams</span></b>:  In case you want to spare respective lab code, there is a magnifying glass.  You click on it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Uh-huh.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Finn Adams</span></b>:  And then in front of CPTs, there is a box.  You search whatever the CPT code you wanna add.  Once you select it, you will see the option available now, a diaper link.  Simply click once on it, and you can close the procedures.  That way, the code will be mapped, and then you press save.  That means with respect to that specter, it has been mapped.  Great.  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  That's awesome.  That's super helpful.  And you can do more than one CPT code per lab.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Finn Adams</span></b>:  Yes.  But you would have to select them one by one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Brilliant.  And then I will just look for the...  I'll do it under a test again.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Finn Adams</span></b>:  Add order.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Got LabCorp pulled up, and we're going to search for 188056.

Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  That's just physical.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think we're supposed to have both of them.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  We have PQ-2 over here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And.  And then PQ.  There it is.  Oh.  So there.  OK.  Oh, so it was in there already.  It just had to scroll up some.  OK.  Right.  Right.  Got it.  PQ-2 and PQ-9.  Yep.  Correct.  Yep.  All right.  So it was up top.  I was looking to the bottom, so that's why.  OK.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  If you want, you can move it down.  Or move PQ-2 up, if you want.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We can do that.  And there we are.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  So do you want to move PQ-2 up, or do you  want to move PQ-9 down?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Let me see.  What did PQ-2 say?  Want to see it?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  PQ-2.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  What's under there?  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  I do not know exactly what does PQ-2 stand for.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm talking about when you pull it up, what's the question?  No, it's just not.  Get a review.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  You do not need the review systems?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  We can remove the review systems.  Don't worry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And.  Yeah, there it is.  I did go to PQ-9.  OK.  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  Let's move it down.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  Under the.

There we are.  Yep.  OK.  OK.  Let's go ahead.  I'm giving you too much stuff to do at one time, Anna.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  No worries.  No worries.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  If we can just go and drag and drop this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  Perfect.  Yeah.  No, it is not allowed.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  We do not need physical exam.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  OK.  You know what, Trace?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  We do have a customization team.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And to be honest.  Oh, wait.  Hold on.  Go down a little bit more.  After that, that's OK.  Leave it right here.  Go back up some.  Twice.  We don't need it twice.  Just need it one time.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  So remove that with physical leave.  We do not need this one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  Let's take that out in the.  Yep.  And then that's it.  Yep.  Perfect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  That's good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  Is there anything else I can.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Because you don't know how to remove the ROS, do you?  No.  I can remove the ROS.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  And it's just that I cannot add it back.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Right.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  If you want, I can remove it.  Do you want to remove it?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  Yep.  Perfect.  All right.  And that's it.  So it looks better.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  That's Dr. Abin.  That's who I work with.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thanks, love.  Yay.  Yay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  So if you do want to go ahead and edit it a bit more.  I mean, if you want to go ahead and add something,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I can get somebody from the customization team  and they could assist.  No.  Actually, he helped me the other day.  He did that.  So that's good.  Oh, OK.  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  Let's just save this then.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Shane Newman</span></b>:  What else do we need to do?  That's it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  Oh.  You did good.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Thank you for all your help.  Yeah.  All right.

How are you?  I'm okay, how are you?  I'm doing good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I've just received your teamwork notification for all the five points.  So is it the right time to discuss that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm sorry, for the what?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  The points which you have mentioned on the teamwork for your anti-healthcare MD-wise and...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh yeah, yeah, the five things, yes.  Yep, so...  Yeah, you want to talk about it?  Yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So are you on your computer right now?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I am.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Okay, so first thing that I will need the placement logins for point number three for  the managed health services Medicaid.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  If you can do the AnyDisk.  Oh, okay. <span style=""color:red""><b>  Yeah, I'll log in</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  You just go to Chrome and type AnyDisk.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It does not require any logins for AnyDisk.  Right, but when I get to AnyDisk...  It wants me to log in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Do you see any number on your screen of AnyDisk?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Okay, I've just sent the request.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay, so yeah, now I can see your screen.  Okay.  Can you log into your Paceman account?  Can I have the control?  You got it.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you guys are not sharing your text ID with other departments like EMS department or other<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  hospitals?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm asking this because when I enroll you with Paceman, your other department, ERAs  will come into Care MD as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  There's no other help you with.  Okay.  Does that make sense?  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So on your Paceman, I'm just seeing one insurance, which is 13 Corporation, and I hope insurance  managed health services.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yep.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I hope now you will receive the ERAs for managed health services into Care MD.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Is that simple?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  I'm just trying to enroll first, then I will let you know if you have any payments into  your Paceman, then I can download all those ERAs and import those ERAs into your Care</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  MD database.  Oh, yeah.  I have several payments.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you have these ERAs into your Paceman account.  Do you want me to download all those ERAs and sync them into your Care MD database?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So after 24 hours, you will be able to see all these ERAs into Care MD.  If you want to pull them, you can do that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Right.  Before we do that, I don't want to pull these payments attached to.  Okay.  No problem.  Does that make sense?  Yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I've enrolled you for the managed health care services. <span style=""color:red""><b>  So from today, if you submit any claims to this particular insurance, you will receive  the ERAs into Care MD as well as into your Paceman</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It should be the same?  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  It should be the same because I did not change your bank account.  I just enrolled you with Care MD just for the ERAs, not for the EFT, KCH.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you just have to submit the claim from Care MD application and hopefully the next  ERA you will receive into Care MD for this managed health services.  So we have done the third part.  So for the fourth part, which is MD wise.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  But the payments are all coming back on paper to run.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So what I did, I've completed your enrollment for MD wise.  Your enrollment is already completed.  So if I have to escalate this issue with our insurance MD wise, they are requiring some  check details, like the recent check which you have received from MD wise.  So would you be able to send me the check number, check amount, and check detail, three<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  check details for MD wise?  Three of them?  Three of them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I can work with the insurance and see what's happening with the MD wise.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So again, they're not checked, but I will send them to you.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Because they require the check number.  If you have received the virtual payment, it must be a number for the amount and the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  date and the dollar.  Yeah, I will send it to you.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I need three of them to work with MD wise to resolve your issue.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  So the fifth one, Echo.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  You have received this payment letter from Echo?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  So I thought this was done.  I thought we already enrolled with Echo?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I sent your paperwork, the EFT paperwork to Echo and I have done some follow-ups with<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So they're asking me that we have already sent an email to verify your account with<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  your practice</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So since I'm not the thrice person, I believe they did not complete the process.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So that's why they are not sending the ACH.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So they're still requiring this information to be verified.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So go to eti.echo.  Do you have the login of this portal?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know.  I don't have an idea.  Joe, do you think we're ever going to get to this or are we just going to see PALS for  the next couple of years?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I never used this portal before, so I'm not sure if you have already the login.  Just put your detail.  If you do not have, we can forget the password and maybe you will receive it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Well, I'm looking.  I don't think there's maybe more history standards.  I think it is.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you did not have an account before?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  I don't know.  These are all alerts from pasting.  We did not use this link before.  I'm sorry?  We didn't use this link before.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  We just received the link.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Right.  I just got it.  I did it too fast.  No.  Close this tab, the last tab.  This one.  The last one.  Yes.  So how's that one?  Do you know?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I don't know because I never used this before.  It's just weird.  We just received the link.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Right.  Yeah, it's not good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  And I cannot even contact EDI support because Ashley's account, not Joe's account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm just looking to see if I have one from earlier.  I don't see anything that looks like it's from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Can you open the first email which we just received?  You can copy from here as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  This is the only email we have received.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes, today.  Yep.  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  That's weird.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So there is one more option that they're requiring a bank letter and wire check to be sent to Echo to complete your enrollment.  You have to write on the DVsConT letterhead and attach all these six wire check account holder name, bank contact information.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So we have the bank letter and into this teamwork thing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Do you have this wire check and bank letter on your computer right now so we can just send an email to Echo to complete?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It's in the things, like it's in the files on Teamwork.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So just download the bank letter and the wire check and we can put the reference code in the email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think it's this one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  I'm just attaching the documents</b></span>.  Just give me one minute.  I'm attaching the document which they are requiring. <span style=""color:red""><b>  I do have the bank letter and the wire check in my system</b></span>.  I'm just attaching the bank letter and the wire check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I know I've typed the latest one.  The bank.  The bank letter.  I think that's the bank letter.  File?  Yep.  I believe so.  Okay.  Keep going, Jo.  I know we said on it.  That's the correct one, right?  It looks like, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Because it says this is to verify DV's County Health Department on all national bank is registered for DV's County employees.  So all three continents are mentioning the bank header, which are confusing before while we are enrolling for.  So just download the other.  Can you just double check the wire check?  This is the latest one I have.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  This last name has changed but she hasn't gotten the updated card yet.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Can you attach all the documents?  I suggest copy the reference number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Do you want me to what?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Copy this reference number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know where it went.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I just copied the reference number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Can you paste it here?  Can I what?  I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Just paste the reference number.  I just copied that reference number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And you want to paste it here?  In the email.  You did there.  I didn't have an answer.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  And can you attach the bank documents, wire check and bank letter as well?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  I think that's all they have needed.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  We have attached the wire check, account holder name is on the bank letter and bank contact information is also in the bank letter.  Count and routing number is also in the bank letter.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Text ID.  Text ID.  That should be on the W9.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Maybe I please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I know it's on the.  W9.  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  We have attached the W9, which text ID is also attached, reference code is also attached.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yep.  Just send that email to Echo.  Got her done.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Just go back to the teamwork.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  There you go.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So the fifth point completed as well.  Now for UNI Healthcare, you're receiving payment as paper checks, right?  Not receiving ACH into Care MD or account?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm getting virtual card payments and paper checks from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So if you go to my previous comment.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yep.  Here it is.  I had a word with UNI Healthcare.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  They have rejected our EFT enrollment.  Starting this, we cannot complete your request.  As in please submit on my trial letter specifying the detail of your request.  This form was not signed by a designated taxpayer identification number.  Super admin or delegated administrator within OptumPay.  Please have a designated 10 super admin or administrator signed.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Please submit the form.  How do I know who that is?  Because that was all set up before I came.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you have to attach, you have to write this call from here to this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  And just sign from the CEO, CFO or office manager or the owner of the tax ID in the Deavey's County.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Would that be the ETA treasurer?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm not sure about the treasurer because what they told me is this form should be signed from the CEO, CFO or office manager or owner of the tax ID.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  They can sign.  Well the tax is Deavey's County and the treasurer fills out our tax identification form every year.  Okay.  That's why I'm asking.  It should be her.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So on the Deavey's County letterhead you have to just copy this whole detail and just put this on the letterhead of Deavey's County and then sign this letterhead from your owner of the tax ID.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  And just send them to, did you not mention the, I believe you have to fax them</b></span>.  You have to not write that letterhead as well before sending them to Optum.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We have a note.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Let me find the fax number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Nailed.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you have to send this, once you not write the Deavey's County letterhead.  You have to send to Optum on this fax number 8442076458.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So you have to copy from here to here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Just type this all detail on Deavey's County letterhead and then just have it signed from the owner of the tax ID.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Then not write that paperwork.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Also you have to attach the bank letter, W9 and the void check.

Yeah, I'll log in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  You just go to Chrome and type AnyDisk.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It does not require any logins for AnyDisk.

Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you guys are not sharing your text ID with other departments like EMS department or other<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  hospitals?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm asking this because when I enroll you with Paceman, your other department, ERAs  will come into Care MD as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  There's no other help you with.  Okay.  Does that make sense?  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So on your Paceman, I'm just seeing one insurance, which is 13 Corporation, and I hope insurance  managed health services.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yep.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I hope now you will receive the ERAs for managed health services into Care MD.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Is that simple?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm just trying to enroll first, then I will let you know if you have any payments into  your Paceman, then I can download all those ERAs and import those ERAs into your Care<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  MD database.  Oh, yeah.  I have several payments.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you have these ERAs into your Paceman account.  Do you want me to download all those ERAs and sync them into your Care MD database?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So after 24 hours, you will be able to see all these ERAs into Care MD.  If you want to pull them, you can do that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Right.  Before we do that, I don't want to pull these payments attached to.  Okay.  No problem.  Does that make sense?  Yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I've enrolled you for the managed health care services.  So from today, if you submit any claims to this particular insurance, you will receive  the ERAs into Care MD as well as into your Paceman.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It should be the same?  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  It should be the same because I did not change your bank account.  I just enrolled you with Care MD just for the ERAs, not for the EFT, KCH.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you just have to submit the claim from Care MD application and hopefully the next  ERA you will receive into Care MD for this managed health services.  So we have done the third part.  So for the fourth part, which is MD wise.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  But the payments are all coming back on paper to run.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So what I did, I've completed your enrollment for MD wise.  Your enrollment is already completed.  So if I have to escalate this issue with our insurance MD wise, they are requiring some  check details, like the recent check which you have received from MD wise.  So would you be able to send me the check number, check amount, and check detail, three<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  check details for MD wise?  Three of them?  Three of them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I can work with the insurance and see what's happening with the MD wise.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So again, they're not checked, but I will send them to you.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Because they require the check number.  If you have received the virtual payment, it must be a number for the amount and the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  date and the dollar.  Yeah, I will send it to you.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I need three of them to work with MD wise to resolve your issue.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  So the fifth one, Echo.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  You have received this payment letter from Echo?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  So I thought this was done.  I thought we already enrolled with Echo?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I sent your paperwork, the EFT paperwork to Echo and I have done some follow-ups with<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So they're asking me that we have already sent an email to verify your account with<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  your practice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So since I'm not the thrice person, I believe they did not complete the process.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So that's why they are not sending the ACH.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So they're still requiring this information to be verified.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So go to eti.echo.  Do you have the login of this portal?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know.  I don't have an idea.  Joe, do you think we're ever going to get to this or are we just going to see PALS for  the next couple of years?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I never used this portal before, so I'm not sure if you have already the login.  Just put your detail.  If you do not have, we can forget the password and maybe you will receive it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Well, I'm looking.  I don't think there's maybe more history standards.  I think it is.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you did not have an account before?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  I don't know.  These are all alerts from pasting.  We did not use this link before.  I'm sorry?  We didn't use this link before.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  We just received the link.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Right.  I just got it.  I did it too fast.  No.  Close this tab, the last tab.  This one.  The last one.  Yes.  So how's that one?  Do you know?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I don't know because I never used this before.  It's just weird.  We just received the link.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Right.  Yeah, it's not good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  And I cannot even contact EDI support because Ashley's account, not Joe's account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm just looking to see if I have one from earlier.  I don't see anything that looks like it's from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Can you open the first email which we just received?  You can copy from here as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  This is the only email we have received.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes, today.  Yep.  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  That's weird.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So there is one more option that they're requiring a bank letter and wire check to be sent to Echo to complete your enrollment.  You have to write on the DVsConT letterhead and attach all these six wire check account holder name, bank contact information.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So we have the bank letter and into this teamwork thing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Do you have this wire check and bank letter on your computer right now so we can just send an email to Echo to complete?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It's in the things, like it's in the files on Teamwork.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So just download the bank letter and the wire check and we can put the reference code in the email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think it's this one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm just attaching the documents.  Just give me one minute.  I'm attaching the document which they are requiring. <span style=""color:red""><b>  I do have the bank letter and the wire check in my system</b></span>.  I'm just attaching the bank letter and the wire check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I know I've typed the latest one.  The bank.  The bank letter.  I think that's the bank letter.  File?  Yep.  I believe so.  Okay.  Keep going, Jo.  I know we said on it.  That's the correct one, right?  It looks like, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Because it says this is to verify DV's County Health Department on all national bank is registered for DV's County employees.  So all three continents are mentioning the bank header, which are confusing before while we are enrolling for.  So just download the other.  Can you just double check the wire check?  This is the latest one I have.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  This last name has changed but she hasn't gotten the updated card yet.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Can you attach all the documents?  I suggest copy the reference number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Do you want me to what?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Copy this reference number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know where it went.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I just copied the reference number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Can you paste it here?  Can I what?  I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Just paste the reference number.  I just copied that reference number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And you want to paste it here?  In the email.  You did there.  I didn't have an answer.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  And can you attach the bank documents, wire check and bank letter as well?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  I think that's all they have needed.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  We have attached the wire check, account holder name is on the bank letter and bank contact information is also in the bank letter.  Count and routing number is also in the bank letter.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Text ID.  Text ID.  That should be on the W9.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Maybe I please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I know it's on the.  W9.  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  We have attached the W9, which text ID is also attached, reference code is also attached.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yep.  Just send that email to Echo.  Got her done.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Just go back to the teamwork.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  There you go.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So the fifth point completed as well.  Now for UNI Healthcare, you're receiving payment as paper checks, right?  Not receiving ACH into Care MD or account?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm getting virtual card payments and paper checks from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So if you go to my previous comment.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yep.  Here it is.  I had a word with UNI Healthcare.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  They have rejected our EFT enrollment.  Starting this, we cannot complete your request.

Well the tax is Deavey's County and the treasurer fills out our tax identification form every year.  Okay.  That's why I'm asking.  It should be her.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So on the Deavey's County letterhead you have to just copy this whole detail and just put this on the letterhead of Deavey's County and then sign this letterhead from your owner of the tax ID.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  And just send them to, did you not mention the, I believe you have to fax them.

Do you want me to download all those ERAs and sync them into your Care MD database?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So after 24 hours, you will be able to see all these ERAs into Care MD.  If you want to pull them, you can do that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Right.  Before we do that, I don't want to pull these payments attached to.  Okay.  No problem.  Does that make sense?  Yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I've enrolled you for the managed health care services.  So from today, if you submit any claims to this particular insurance, you will receive  the ERAs into Care MD as well as into your Paceman.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It should be the same?  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  It should be the same because I did not change your bank account.  I just enrolled you with Care MD just for the ERAs, not for the EFT, KCH.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you just have to submit the claim from Care MD application and hopefully the next  ERA you will receive into Care MD for this managed health services.  So we have done the third part.  So for the fourth part, which is MD wise.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  But the payments are all coming back on paper to run.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So what I did, I've completed your enrollment for MD wise.  Your enrollment is already completed.  So if I have to escalate this issue with our insurance MD wise, they are requiring some  check details, like the recent check which you have received from MD wise.  So would you be able to send me the check number, check amount, and check detail, three<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  check details for MD wise?  Three of them?  Three of them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I can work with the insurance and see what's happening with the MD wise.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So again, they're not checked, but I will send them to you.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Because they require the check number.  If you have received the virtual payment, it must be a number for the amount and the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  date and the dollar.  Yeah, I will send it to you.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I need three of them to work with MD wise to resolve your issue.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  So the fifth one, Echo.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  You have received this payment letter from Echo?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  So I thought this was done.  I thought we already enrolled with Echo?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I sent your paperwork, the EFT paperwork to Echo and I have done some follow-ups with<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So they're asking me that we have already sent an email to verify your account with<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  your practice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So since I'm not the thrice person, I believe they did not complete the process.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So that's why they are not sending the ACH.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So they're still requiring this information to be verified.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So go to eti.echo.  Do you have the login of this portal?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know.  I don't have an idea.  Joe, do you think we're ever going to get to this or are we just going to see PALS for  the next couple of years?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I never used this portal before, so I'm not sure if you have already the login.  Just put your detail.  If you do not have, we can forget the password and maybe you will receive it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Well, I'm looking.  I don't think there's maybe more history standards.  I think it is.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you did not have an account before?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  I don't know.  These are all alerts from pasting.  We did not use this link before.  I'm sorry?  We didn't use this link before.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  We just received the link.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Right.  I just got it.  I did it too fast.  No.  Close this tab, the last tab.  This one.  The last one.  Yes.  So how's that one?  Do you know?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I don't know because I never used this before.  It's just weird.  We just received the link.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Right.  Yeah, it's not good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  And I cannot even contact EDI support because Ashley's account, not Joe's account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm just looking to see if I have one from earlier.  I don't see anything that looks like it's from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Can you open the first email which we just received?  You can copy from here as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  This is the only email we have received.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes, today.  Yep.  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  That's weird.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So there is one more option that they're requiring a bank letter and wire check to be sent to Echo to complete your enrollment.  You have to write on the DVsConT letterhead and attach all these six wire check account holder name, bank contact information.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So we have the bank letter and into this teamwork thing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Do you have this wire check and bank letter on your computer right now so we can just send an email to Echo to complete?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It's in the things, like it's in the files on Teamwork.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So just download the bank letter and the wire check and we can put the reference code in the email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think it's this one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm just attaching the documents.  Just give me one minute.  I'm attaching the document which they are requiring.  I do have the bank letter and the wire check in my system.  I'm just attaching the bank letter and the wire check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I know I've typed the latest one.  The bank.  The bank letter.  I think that's the bank letter.  File?  Yep.  I believe so.  Okay.  Keep going, Jo.  I know we said on it.  That's the correct one, right?  It looks like, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Because it says this is to verify DV's County Health Department on all national bank is registered for DV's County employees.  So all three continents are mentioning the bank header, which are confusing before while we are enrolling for.  So just download the other.  Can you just double check the wire check?  This is the latest one I have.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  This last name has changed but she hasn't gotten the updated card yet.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Can you attach all the documents?  I suggest copy the reference number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Do you want me to what?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Copy this reference number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know where it went.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I just copied the reference number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Can you paste it here?  Can I what?  I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Just paste the reference number.  I just copied that reference number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And you want to paste it here?  In the email.  You did there.  I didn't have an answer.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  And can you attach the bank documents, wire check and bank letter as well?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  I think that's all they have needed.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  We have attached the wire check, account holder name is on the bank letter and bank contact information is also in the bank letter.  Count and routing number is also in the bank letter.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Text ID.  Text ID.  That should be on the W9.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Maybe I please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I know it's on the.  W9.  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  We have attached the W9, which text ID is also attached, reference code is also attached.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yep.  Just send that email to Echo.  Got her done.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Just go back to the teamwork.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  There you go.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So the fifth point completed as well.  Now for UNI Healthcare, you're receiving payment as paper checks, right?  Not receiving ACH into Care MD or account?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm getting virtual card payments and paper checks from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So if you go to my previous comment.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yep.  Here it is.  I had a word with UNI Healthcare.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  They have rejected our EFT enrollment.  Starting this, we cannot complete your request.  As in please submit on my trial letter specifying the detail of your request.  This form was not signed by a designated taxpayer identification number.  Super admin or delegated administrator within OptumPay.  Please have a designated 10 super admin or administrator signed.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Please submit the form.  How do I know who that is?  Because that was all set up before I came.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you have to attach, you have to write this call from here to this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  And just sign from the CEO, CFO or office manager or the owner of the tax ID in the Deavey's County.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Would that be the ETA treasurer?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm not sure about the treasurer because what they told me is this form should be signed from the CEO, CFO or office manager or owner of the tax ID.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  They can sign.  Well the tax is Deavey's County and the treasurer fills out our tax identification form every year.  Okay.  That's why I'm asking.  It should be her.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So on the Deavey's County letterhead you have to just copy this whole detail and just put this on the letterhead of Deavey's County and then sign this letterhead from your owner of the tax ID.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  And just send them to, did you not mention the, I believe you have to fax them.  You have to not write that letterhead as well before sending them to Optum.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We have a note.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Let me find the fax number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Nailed.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you have to send this, once you not write the Deavey's County letterhead.  You have to send to Optum on this fax number 8442076458.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So you have to copy from here to here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Just type this all detail on Deavey's County letterhead and then just have it signed from the owner of the tax ID.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Then not write that paperwork.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Also you have to attach the bank letter, W9 and the void check.  Just attach all two documents along with the letterhead and just fax it on 844 and see what the next response you will get from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  Now we are done with second part.  Your Healthcare, MHS.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I've initiated the enrollment process for MHS.  I need the void check for, sorry, I need the check example for MDYs and we just sent the email to Echo.  So for the part one, which is Medicare, Stuart is not in today so he will come tomorrow and I will have a word with him and he will call you and guide you how we can resolve the Medicare thing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, we're really in a bind here without the Medicare thing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Yeah, because you know to get your login ready with Medicare we required the check number and once you receive the check number only we can create the login details on WPS.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, I fully understand the process but I have not gotten a payment and I've sent off at 6 and I've heard nothing.  Not a denial, not a payment, no nothing.  So I don't know what the problem is.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  What my understanding is that your HICFA form is not aligned.  Maybe that's the reason you're not receiving any response from Medicare.  I haven't heard anything from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Exactly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  For this, the last page you must have received any response from Medicare but I'm not sure why they're not responding to your claims, paper claims.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So just wait for tomorrow.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I will have a word with them.  Maybe.  I'm not sure about this.  I have to check with Stuart.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you have to wait for Medicare for tomorrow and rest.  Just send the letterhead to Optum and see what response we will get from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay, so that's all.  Alright, yep, that's my homework.  I'll try to get that done by tomorrow.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Okay, thanks so much Ashley.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye.<br>",,,"<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  This is Ashley.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Hey Ashley, this is Joe from Care MD.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Hey Joe.  How are you?  I'm okay, how are you?  I'm doing good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I've just received your teamwork notification for all the five points.  So is it the right time to discuss that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm sorry, for the what?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  The points which you have mentioned on the teamwork for your anti-healthcare MD-wise and...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh yeah, yeah, the five things, yes.  Yep, so...  Yeah, you want to talk about it?  Yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So are you on your computer right now?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I am.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Okay, so first thing that I will need the placement logins for point number three for  the managed health services Medicaid.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  If you can do the AnyDisk.  Oh, okay. <span style=""color:red""><b>  Yeah, I'll log in</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  You just go to Chrome and type AnyDisk.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It does not require any logins for AnyDisk.  Right, but when I get to AnyDisk...  It wants me to log in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Do you see any number on your screen of AnyDisk?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Okay, I've just sent the request.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay, so yeah, now I can see your screen.  Okay.  Can you log into your Paceman account?  Can I have the control?  You got it.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you guys are not sharing your text ID with other departments like EMS department or other<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  hospitals?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm asking this because when I enroll you with Paceman, your other department, ERAs  will come into Care MD as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  There's no other help you with.  Okay.  Does that make sense?  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So on your Paceman, I'm just seeing one insurance, which is 13 Corporation, and I hope insurance  managed health services.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yep.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I hope now you will receive the ERAs for managed health services into Care MD.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Is that simple?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm just trying to enroll first, then I will let you know if you have any payments into  your Paceman, then I can download all those ERAs and import those ERAs into your Care<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  MD database.  Oh, yeah.  I have several payments.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you have these ERAs into your Paceman account.  Do you want me to download all those ERAs and sync them into your Care MD database?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So after 24 hours, you will be able to see all these ERAs into Care MD.  If you want to pull them, you can do that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Right.  Before we do that, I don't want to pull these payments attached to.  Okay.

Yeah, it's not good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  And I cannot even contact EDI support because Ashley's account, not Joe's account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm just looking to see if I have one from earlier.  I don't see anything that looks like it's from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Can you open the first email which we just received?  You can copy from here as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  This is the only email we have received.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes, today.

Yes, it is.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So there is one more option that they're requiring a bank letter and wire check to be sent to Echo to complete your enrollment.  You have to write on the DVsConT letterhead and attach all these six wire check account holder name, bank contact information.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So we have the bank letter and into this teamwork thing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Do you have this wire check and bank letter on your computer right now so we can just send an email to Echo to complete?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It's in the things, like it's in the files on Teamwork.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So just download the bank letter and the wire check and we can put the reference code in the email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think it's this one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm just attaching the documents.

It looks like, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Because it says this is to verify DV's County Health Department on all national bank is registered for DV's County employees.  So all three continents are mentioning the bank header, which are confusing before while we are enrolling for.  So just download the other.  Can you just double check the wire check?  This is the latest one I have.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  This last name has changed but she hasn't gotten the updated card yet.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Can you attach all the documents?

I just copied that reference number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And you want to paste it here?  In the email.  You did there.  I didn't have an answer.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  And can you attach the bank documents, wire check and bank letter as well?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  I think that's all they have needed.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  We have attached the wire check, account holder name is on the bank letter and bank contact information is also in the bank letter.  Count and routing number is also in the bank letter.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Text ID.  Text ID.  That should be on the W9.

Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Just go back to the teamwork.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  There you go.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So the fifth point completed as well.  Now for UNI Healthcare, you're receiving payment as paper checks, right?  Not receiving ACH into Care MD or account?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm getting virtual card payments and paper checks from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So if you go to my previous comment.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yep.  Here it is.  I had a word with UNI Healthcare.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  They have rejected our EFT enrollment.  Starting this, we cannot complete your request.  As in please submit on my trial letter specifying the detail of your request.  This form was not signed by a designated taxpayer identification number.  Super admin or delegated administrator within OptumPay.  Please have a designated 10 super admin or administrator signed.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Please submit the form.  How do I know who that is?  Because that was all set up before I came.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you have to attach, you have to write this call from here to this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  And just sign from the CEO, CFO or office manager or the owner of the tax ID in the Deavey's County.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Would that be the ETA treasurer?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm not sure about the treasurer because what they told me is this form should be signed from the CEO, CFO or office manager or owner of the tax ID.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  They can sign.  Well the tax is Deavey's County and the treasurer fills out our tax identification form every year.  Okay.  That's why I'm asking.  It should be her.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So on the Deavey's County letterhead you have to just copy this whole detail and just put this on the letterhead of Deavey's County and then sign this letterhead from your owner of the tax ID.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  And just send them to, did you not mention the, I believe you have to fax them.  You have to not write that letterhead as well before sending them to Optum.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We have a note.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Let me find the fax number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Nailed.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you have to send this, once you not write the Deavey's County letterhead.  You have to send to Optum on this fax number 8442076458.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So you have to copy from here to here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Just type this all detail on Deavey's County letterhead and then just have it signed from the owner of the tax ID.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Then not write that paperwork.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Also you have to attach the bank letter, W9 and the void check.  Just attach all two documents along with the letterhead and just fax it on 844 and see what the next response you will get from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  Now we are done with second part.  Your Healthcare, MHS.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I've initiated the enrollment process for MHS.  I need the void check for, sorry, I need the check example for MDYs and we just sent the email to Echo.  So for the part one, which is Medicare, Stuart is not in today so he will come tomorrow and I will have a word with him and he will call you and guide you how we can resolve the Medicare thing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, we're really in a bind here without the Medicare thing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Yeah, because you know to get your login ready with Medicare we required the check number and once you receive the check number only we can create the login details on WPS.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, I fully understand the process but I have not gotten a payment and I've sent off at 6 and I've heard nothing.  Not a denial, not a payment, no nothing.  So I don't know what the problem is.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  What my understanding is that your HICFA form is not aligned.  Maybe that's the reason you're not receiving any response from Medicare.  I haven't heard anything from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Exactly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  For this, the last page you must have received any response from Medicare but I'm not sure why they're not responding to your claims, paper claims.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So just wait for tomorrow.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I will have a word with them.  Maybe.  I'm not sure about this.  I have to check with Stuart.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you have to wait for Medicare for tomorrow and rest.  Just send the letterhead to Optum and see what response we will get from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay, so that's all.  Alright, yep, that's my homework.  I'll try to get that done by tomorrow.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Okay, thanks so much Ashley.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye.<br>",,,"<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  This is Ashley.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Hey Ashley, this is Joe from Care MD.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Hey Joe.  How are you?  I'm okay, how are you?  I'm doing good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I've just received your teamwork notification for all the five points.  So is it the right time to discuss that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm sorry, for the what?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  The points which you have mentioned on the teamwork for your anti-healthcare MD-wise and...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh yeah, yeah, the five things, yes.  Yep, so...  Yeah, you want to talk about it?  Yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So are you on your computer right now?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I am.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Okay, so first thing that I will need the placement logins for point number three for  the managed health services Medicaid.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  If you can do the AnyDisk.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I'll log in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  You just go to Chrome and type AnyDisk.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It does not require any logins for AnyDisk.  Right, but when I get to AnyDisk...  It wants me to log in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Do you see any number on your screen of AnyDisk?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Okay, I've just sent the request.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay, so yeah, now I can see your screen.  Okay.  Can you log into your Paceman account?  Can I have the control?  You got it.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you guys are not sharing your text ID with other departments like EMS department or other<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  hospitals?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm asking this because when I enroll you with Paceman, your other department, ERAs  will come into Care MD as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  There's no other help you with.  Okay.  Does that make sense?  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So on your Paceman, I'm just seeing one insurance, which is 13 Corporation, and I hope insurance  managed health services.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yep.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I hope now you will receive the ERAs for managed health services into Care MD.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Is that simple?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm just trying to enroll first, then I will let you know if you have any payments into  your Paceman, then I can download all those ERAs and import those ERAs into your Care<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  MD database.  Oh, yeah.  I have several payments.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you have these ERAs into your Paceman account.  Do you want me to download all those ERAs and sync them into your Care MD database?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So after 24 hours, you will be able to see all these ERAs into Care MD.  If you want to pull them, you can do that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Right.  Before we do that, I don't want to pull these payments attached to.  Okay.  No problem.  Does that make sense?  Yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I've enrolled you for the managed health care services. <span style=""color:red""><b>  So from today, if you submit any claims to this particular insurance, you will receive  the ERAs into Care MD as well as into your Paceman</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It should be the same?  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  It should be the same because I did not change your bank account.  I just enrolled you with Care MD just for the ERAs, not for the EFT, KCH.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you just have to submit the claim from Care MD application and hopefully the next  ERA you will receive into Care MD for this managed health services.  So we have done the third part.  So for the fourth part, which is MD wise.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  But the payments are all coming back on paper to run.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So what I did, I've completed your enrollment for MD wise.  Your enrollment is already completed.  So if I have to escalate this issue with our insurance MD wise, they are requiring some  check details, like the recent check which you have received from MD wise.  So would you be able to send me the check number, check amount, and check detail, three<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  check details for MD wise?  Three of them?  Three of them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I can work with the insurance and see what's happening with the MD wise.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So again, they're not checked, but I will send them to you.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Because they require the check number.  If you have received the virtual payment, it must be a number for the amount and the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  date and the dollar.  Yeah, I will send it to you.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I need three of them to work with MD wise to resolve your issue.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  So the fifth one, Echo.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  You have received this payment letter from Echo?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  So I thought this was done.  I thought we already enrolled with Echo?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I sent your paperwork, the EFT paperwork to Echo and I have done some follow-ups with<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So they're asking me that we have already sent an email to verify your account with<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  your practice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So since I'm not the thrice person, I believe they did not complete the process.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So that's why they are not sending the ACH.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So they're still requiring this information to be verified.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So go to eti.echo.  Do you have the login of this portal?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know.  I don't have an idea.  Joe, do you think we're ever going to get to this or are we just going to see PALS for  the next couple of years?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I never used this portal before, so I'm not sure if you have already the login.  Just put your detail.  If you do not have, we can forget the password and maybe you will receive it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Well, I'm looking.  I don't think there's maybe more history standards.  I think it is.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you did not have an account before?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  I don't know.  These are all alerts from pasting.  We did not use this link before.  I'm sorry?  We didn't use this link before.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  We just received the link.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Right.  I just got it.  I did it too fast.  No.  Close this tab, the last tab.  This one.  The last one.  Yes.  So how's that one?  Do you know?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I don't know because I never used this before.  It's just weird.  We just received the link.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Right.  Yeah, it's not good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  And I cannot even contact EDI support because Ashley's account, not Joe's account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm just looking to see if I have one from earlier.  I don't see anything that looks like it's from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Can you open the first email which we just received?  You can copy from here as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  This is the only email we have received.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes, today.  Yep.  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  That's weird.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So there is one more option that they're requiring a bank letter and wire check to be sent to Echo to complete your enrollment.  You have to write on the DVsConT letterhead and attach all these six wire check account holder name, bank contact information.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So we have the bank letter and into this teamwork thing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Do you have this wire check and bank letter on your computer right now so we can just send an email to Echo to complete?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It's in the things, like it's in the files on Teamwork.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So just download the bank letter and the wire check and we can put the reference code in the email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think it's this one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  I'm just attaching the documents</b></span>.

Well the tax is Deavey's County and the treasurer fills out our tax identification form every year.  Okay.  That's why I'm asking.  It should be her.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So on the Deavey's County letterhead you have to just copy this whole detail and just put this on the letterhead of Deavey's County and then sign this letterhead from your owner of the tax ID.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  And just send them to, did you not mention the, I believe you have to fax them</b></span>.  You have to not write that letterhead as well before sending them to Optum.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We have a note.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Let me find the fax number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Nailed.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you have to send this, once you not write the Deavey's County letterhead.  You have to send to Optum on this fax number 8442076458.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So you have to copy from here to here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Just type this all detail on Deavey's County letterhead and then just have it signed from the owner of the tax ID.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Then not write that paperwork.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Also you have to attach the bank letter, W9 and the void check.  Just attach all two documents along with the letterhead and just fax it on 844 and see what the next response you will get from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  Now we are done with second part.  Your Healthcare, MHS.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I've initiated the enrollment process for MHS.  I need the void check for, sorry, I need the check example for MDYs and we just sent the email to Echo.  So for the part one, which is Medicare, Stuart is not in today so he will come tomorrow and I will have a word with him and he will call you and guide you how we can resolve the Medicare thing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, we're really in a bind here without the Medicare thing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Yeah, because you know to get your login ready with Medicare we required the check number and once you receive the check number only we can create the login details on WPS.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, I fully understand the process but I have not gotten a payment and I've sent off at 6 and I've heard nothing.  Not a denial, not a payment, no nothing.  So I don't know what the problem is.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  What my understanding is that your HICFA form is not aligned.  Maybe that's the reason you're not receiving any response from Medicare.  I haven't heard anything from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Exactly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  For this, the last page you must have received any response from Medicare but I'm not sure why they're not responding to your claims, paper claims.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So just wait for tomorrow.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I will have a word with them.  Maybe.  I'm not sure about this.  I have to check with Stuart.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you have to wait for Medicare for tomorrow and rest.  Just send the letterhead to Optum and see what response we will get from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay, so that's all.  Alright, yep, that's my homework.  I'll try to get that done by tomorrow.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Okay, thanks so much Ashley.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye.<br>",,"<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  This is Ashley.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Hey Ashley, this is Joe from Care MD.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Hey Joe.  How are you?  I'm okay, how are you?  I'm doing good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I've just received your teamwork notification for all the five points.  So is it the right time to discuss that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm sorry, for the what?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  The points which you have mentioned on the teamwork for your anti-healthcare MD-wise and...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh yeah, yeah, the five things, yes.  Yep, so...  Yeah, you want to talk about it?  Yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So are you on your computer right now?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I am.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Okay, so first thing that I will need the placement logins for point number three for  the managed health services Medicaid.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  If you can do the AnyDisk.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I'll log in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  You just go to Chrome and type AnyDisk.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It does not require any logins for AnyDisk.  Right, but when I get to AnyDisk...  It wants me to log in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Do you see any number on your screen of AnyDisk?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Okay, I've just sent the request.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay, so yeah, now I can see your screen.  Okay.  Can you log into your Paceman account?  Can I have the control?  You got it.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you guys are not sharing your text ID with other departments like EMS department or other<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  hospitals?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm asking this because when I enroll you with Paceman, your other department, ERAs  will come into Care MD as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  There's no other help you with.  Okay.  Does that make sense?  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So on your Paceman, I'm just seeing one insurance, which is 13 Corporation, and I hope insurance  managed health services.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yep.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I hope now you will receive the ERAs for managed health services into Care MD.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Is that simple?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm just trying to enroll first, then I will let you know if you have any payments into  your Paceman, then I can download all those ERAs and import those ERAs into your Care<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  MD database.  Oh, yeah.  I have several payments.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you have these ERAs into your Paceman account.  Do you want me to download all those ERAs and sync them into your Care MD database?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So after 24 hours, you will be able to see all these ERAs into Care MD.  If you want to pull them, you can do that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Right.  Before we do that, I don't want to pull these payments attached to.  Okay.  No problem.  Does that make sense?  Yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I've enrolled you for the managed health care services.  So from today, if you submit any claims to this particular insurance, you will receive  the ERAs into Care MD as well as into your Paceman.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It should be the same?  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  It should be the same because I did not change your bank account.  I just enrolled you with Care MD just for the ERAs, not for the EFT, KCH.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you just have to submit the claim from Care MD application and hopefully the next  ERA you will receive into Care MD for this managed health services.  So we have done the third part.  So for the fourth part, which is MD wise.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  But the payments are all coming back on paper to run.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So what I did, I've completed your enrollment for MD wise.  Your enrollment is already completed.  So if I have to escalate this issue with our insurance MD wise, they are requiring some  check details, like the recent check which you have received from MD wise.  So would you be able to send me the check number, check amount, and check detail, three<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  check details for MD wise?  Three of them?  Three of them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I can work with the insurance and see what's happening with the MD wise.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So again, they're not checked, but I will send them to you.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Because they require the check number.  If you have received the virtual payment, it must be a number for the amount and the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  date and the dollar.  Yeah, I will send it to you.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I need three of them to work with MD wise to resolve your issue.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  So the fifth one, Echo.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  You have received this payment letter from Echo?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  So I thought this was done.  I thought we already enrolled with Echo?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I sent your paperwork, the EFT paperwork to Echo and I have done some follow-ups with<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So they're asking me that we have already sent an email to verify your account with<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  your practice</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So since I'm not the thrice person, I believe they did not complete the process.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So that's why they are not sending the ACH.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So they're still requiring this information to be verified.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So go to eti.echo.  Do you have the login of this portal?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know.  I don't have an idea.  Joe, do you think we're ever going to get to this or are we just going to see PALS for  the next couple of years?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I never used this portal before, so I'm not sure if you have already the login.  Just put your detail.  If you do not have, we can forget the password and maybe you will receive it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Well, I'm looking.  I don't think there's maybe more history standards.  I think it is.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you did not have an account before?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  I don't know.  These are all alerts from pasting.  We did not use this link before.  I'm sorry?  We didn't use this link before.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  We just received the link.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Right.  I just got it.  I did it too fast.  No.  Close this tab, the last tab.  This one.  The last one.  Yes.  So how's that one?  Do you know?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I don't know because I never used this before.  It's just weird.  We just received the link.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Right.  Yeah, it's not good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  And I cannot even contact EDI support because Ashley's account, not Joe's account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm just looking to see if I have one from earlier.  I don't see anything that looks like it's from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Can you open the first email which we just received?  You can copy from here as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  This is the only email we have received.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes, today.  Yep.  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  That's weird.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So there is one more option that they're requiring a bank letter and wire check to be sent to Echo to complete your enrollment.  You have to write on the DVsConT letterhead and attach all these six wire check account holder name, bank contact information.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So we have the bank letter and into this teamwork thing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Do you have this wire check and bank letter on your computer right now so we can just send an email to Echo to complete?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It's in the things, like it's in the files on Teamwork.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So just download the bank letter and the wire check and we can put the reference code in the email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think it's this one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm just attaching the documents.  Just give me one minute.  I'm attaching the document which they are requiring.  I do have the bank letter and the wire check in my system.  I'm just attaching the bank letter and the wire check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I know I've typed the latest one.  The bank.  The bank letter.  I think that's the bank letter.  File?  Yep.  I believe so.  Okay.  Keep going, Jo.  I know we said on it.  That's the correct one, right?  It looks like, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Because it says this is to verify DV's County Health Department on all national bank is registered for DV's County employees.  So all three continents are mentioning the bank header, which are confusing before while we are enrolling for.  So just download the other.  Can you just double check the wire check?  This is the latest one I have.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  This last name has changed but she hasn't gotten the updated card yet.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Can you attach all the documents?  I suggest copy the reference number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Do you want me to what?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Copy this reference number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know where it went.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I just copied the reference number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Can you paste it here?  Can I what?  I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Just paste the reference number.  I just copied that reference number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And you want to paste it here?  In the email.  You did there.  I didn't have an answer.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  And can you attach the bank documents, wire check and bank letter as well?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  I think that's all they have needed.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  We have attached the wire check, account holder name is on the bank letter and bank contact information is also in the bank letter.  Count and routing number is also in the bank letter.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Text ID.  Text ID.  That should be on the W9.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Maybe I please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I know it's on the.  W9.  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  We have attached the W9, which text ID is also attached, reference code is also attached.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yep.  Just send that email to Echo.  Got her done.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Just go back to the teamwork.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  There you go.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So the fifth point completed as well.  Now for UNI Healthcare, you're receiving payment as paper checks, right?  Not receiving ACH into Care MD or account?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm getting virtual card payments and paper checks from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So if you go to my previous comment.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yep.

So is it the right time to discuss that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm sorry, for the what?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  The points which you have mentioned on the teamwork for your anti-healthcare MD-wise and...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Oh yeah, yeah, the five things, yes.  Yep, so...  Yeah, you want to talk about it?  Yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So are you on your computer right now?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I am.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Okay, so first thing that I will need the placement logins for point number three for  the managed health services Medicaid.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  If you can do the AnyDisk.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I'll log in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  You just go to Chrome and type AnyDisk.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It does not require any logins for AnyDisk.  Right, but when I get to AnyDisk...  It wants me to log in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Do you see any number on your screen of AnyDisk?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Okay, I've just sent the request.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay, so yeah, now I can see your screen.  Okay.  Can you log into your Paceman account?  Can I have the control?  You got it.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you guys are not sharing your text ID with other departments like EMS department or other<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  hospitals?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm asking this because when I enroll you with Paceman, your other department, ERAs  will come into Care MD as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  There's no other help you with.  Okay.  Does that make sense?  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So on your Paceman, I'm just seeing one insurance, which is 13 Corporation, and I hope insurance  managed health services.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yep.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I hope now you will receive the ERAs for managed health services into Care MD.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Is that simple?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm just trying to enroll first, then I will let you know if you have any payments into  your Paceman, then I can download all those ERAs and import those ERAs into your Care<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  MD database.  Oh, yeah.  I have several payments.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you have these ERAs into your Paceman account.  Do you want me to download all those ERAs and sync them into your Care MD database?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So after 24 hours, you will be able to see all these ERAs into Care MD.  If you want to pull them, you can do that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Right.  Before we do that, I don't want to pull these payments attached to.  Okay.  No problem.  Does that make sense?  Yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I've enrolled you for the managed health care services. <span style=""color:red""><b>  So from today, if you submit any claims to this particular insurance, you will receive  the ERAs into Care MD as well as into your Paceman</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It should be the same?  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  It should be the same because I did not change your bank account.  I just enrolled you with Care MD just for the ERAs, not for the EFT, KCH.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you just have to submit the claim from Care MD application and hopefully the next  ERA you will receive into Care MD for this managed health services.  So we have done the third part.  So for the fourth part, which is MD wise.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  But the payments are all coming back on paper to run.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So what I did, I've completed your enrollment for MD wise.  Your enrollment is already completed.  So if I have to escalate this issue with our insurance MD wise, they are requiring some  check details, like the recent check which you have received from MD wise.  So would you be able to send me the check number, check amount, and check detail, three<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  check details for MD wise?  Three of them?  Three of them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I can work with the insurance and see what's happening with the MD wise.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So again, they're not checked, but I will send them to you.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Because they require the check number.  If you have received the virtual payment, it must be a number for the amount and the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  date and the dollar.  Yeah, I will send it to you.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So I need three of them to work with MD wise to resolve your issue.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  So the fifth one, Echo.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  You have received this payment letter from Echo?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes.  So I thought this was done.  I thought we already enrolled with Echo?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I sent your paperwork, the EFT paperwork to Echo and I have done some follow-ups with<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So they're asking me that we have already sent an email to verify your account with<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  your practice.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So since I'm not the thrice person, I believe they did not complete the process.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So that's why they are not sending the ACH.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So they're still requiring this information to be verified.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So go to eti.echo.  Do you have the login of this portal?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know.  I don't have an idea.  Joe, do you think we're ever going to get to this or are we just going to see PALS for  the next couple of years?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I never used this portal before, so I'm not sure if you have already the login.  Just put your detail.  If you do not have, we can forget the password and maybe you will receive it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Well, I'm looking.  I don't think there's maybe more history standards.  I think it is.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you did not have an account before?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.  I don't know.  These are all alerts from pasting.  We did not use this link before.  I'm sorry?  We didn't use this link before.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  We just received the link.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Right.  I just got it.  I did it too fast.  No.  Close this tab, the last tab.  This one.  The last one.  Yes.  So how's that one?  Do you know?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I don't know because I never used this before.  It's just weird.  We just received the link.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Right.  Yeah, it's not good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  And I cannot even contact EDI support because Ashley's account, not Joe's account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I'm just looking to see if I have one from earlier.  I don't see anything that looks like it's from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Can you open the first email which we just received?  You can copy from here as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  This is the only email we have received.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes, today.  Yep.  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  That's weird.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So there is one more option that they're requiring a bank letter and wire check to be sent to Echo to complete your enrollment.  You have to write on the DVsConT letterhead and attach all these six wire check account holder name, bank contact information.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So we have the bank letter and into this teamwork thing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Do you have this wire check and bank letter on your computer right now so we can just send an email to Echo to complete?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  It's in the things, like it's in the files on Teamwork.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So just download the bank letter and the wire check and we can put the reference code in the email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I think it's this one.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm just attaching the documents.  Just give me one minute.  I'm attaching the document which they are requiring.  I do have the bank letter and the wire check in my system.  I'm just attaching the bank letter and the wire check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I know I've typed the latest one.  The bank.  The bank letter.  I think that's the bank letter.  File?  Yep.  I believe so.  Okay.  Keep going, Jo.  I know we said on it.  That's the correct one, right?  It looks like, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Because it says this is to verify DV's County Health Department on all national bank is registered for DV's County employees.  So all three continents are mentioning the bank header, which are confusing before while we are enrolling for.  So just download the other.  Can you just double check the wire check?  This is the latest one I have.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  This last name has changed but she hasn't gotten the updated card yet.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Can you attach all the documents?  I suggest copy the reference number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Do you want me to what?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Copy this reference number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I don't know where it went.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I just copied the reference number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Can you paste it here?  Can I what?  I'm sorry.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Just paste the reference number.  I just copied that reference number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  And you want to paste it here?  In the email.  You did there.  I didn't have an answer.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  And can you attach the bank documents, wire check and bank letter as well?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  I think that's all they have needed.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  We have attached the wire check, account holder name is on the bank letter and bank contact information is also in the bank letter.  Count and routing number is also in the bank letter.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Text ID.  Text ID.  That should be on the W9.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Maybe I please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I know it's on the.  W9.  Yep.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  We have attached the W9, which text ID is also attached, reference code is also attached.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yep.  Just send that email to Echo.  Got her done.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Just go back to the teamwork.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  There you go.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So the fifth point completed as well.  Now for UNI Healthcare, you're receiving payment as paper checks, right?  Not receiving ACH into Care MD or account?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm getting virtual card payments and paper checks from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So if you go to my previous comment.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yep.  Here it is.  I had a word with UNI Healthcare.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  They have rejected our EFT enrollment.  Starting this, we cannot complete your request.  As in please submit on my trial letter specifying the detail of your request.  This form was not signed by a designated taxpayer identification number.  Super admin or delegated administrator within OptumPay.  Please have a designated 10 super admin or administrator signed.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Please submit the form.  How do I know who that is?  Because that was all set up before I came.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you have to attach, you have to write this call from here to this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  And just sign from the CEO, CFO or office manager or the owner of the tax ID in the Deavey's County.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Would that be the ETA treasurer?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I'm not sure about the treasurer because what they told me is this form should be signed from the CEO, CFO or office manager or owner of the tax ID.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  They can sign.  Well the tax is Deavey's County and the treasurer fills out our tax identification form every year.  Okay.  That's why I'm asking.  It should be her.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So on the Deavey's County letterhead you have to just copy this whole detail and just put this on the letterhead of Deavey's County and then sign this letterhead from your owner of the tax ID.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  And just send them to, did you not mention the, I believe you have to fax them.  You have to not write that letterhead as well before sending them to Optum.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  We have a note.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Let me find the fax number.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Nailed.  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you have to send this, once you not write the Deavey's County letterhead.  You have to send to Optum on this fax number 8442076458.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  So you have to copy from here to here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Just type this all detail on Deavey's County letterhead and then just have it signed from the owner of the tax ID.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Then not write that paperwork.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Also you have to attach the bank letter, W9 and the void check.  Just attach all two documents along with the letterhead and just fax it on 844 and see what the next response you will get from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  Now we are done with second part.  Your Healthcare, MHS.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  I've initiated the enrollment process for MHS.  I need the void check for, sorry, I need the check example for MDYs and we just sent the email to Echo.  So for the part one, which is Medicare, Stuart is not in today so he will come tomorrow and I will have a word with him and he will call you and guide you how we can resolve the Medicare thing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, we're really in a bind here without the Medicare thing.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Yeah, because you know to get your login ready with Medicare we required the check number and once you receive the check number only we can create the login details on WPS.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Yeah, I fully understand the process but I have not gotten a payment and I've sent off at 6 and I've heard nothing.  Not a denial, not a payment, no nothing.  So I don't know what the problem is.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  What my understanding is that your HICFA form is not aligned.  Maybe that's the reason you're not receiving any response from Medicare.  I haven't heard anything from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Exactly.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  For this, the last page you must have received any response from Medicare but I'm not sure why they're not responding to your claims, paper claims.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So just wait for tomorrow.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  I will have a word with them.  Maybe.  I'm not sure about this.  I have to check with Stuart.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  So you have to wait for Medicare for tomorrow and rest.  Just send the letterhead to Optum and see what response we will get from them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay, so that's all.  Alright, yep, that's my homework.  I'll try to get that done by tomorrow.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Joe White</span></b>:  Okay, thanks so much Ashley.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Thank you.

I'm really sorry, but for now we don't have that edit option, but in future, yes, there is a possibility we will have, but I'm not sure.  So what I would recommend when you post the refund, you can add comments just to build a better understanding for you and for the other people who are going to work.  So, and when you will post the payment to the other data service, I would recommend post the comments over there as well.  Yes, I will. Don't worry.  Thank you. No problem. Thank you, Tracy.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Capital Brain Center</span></b>:  Okay. Thank you so much. You have a good day.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ethan Rogers</span></b>:  You too. Bye-bye. Bye.<br>","<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ethan Rogers</span></b>:  Hi, this is Ethan from Care MD. I'm looking for Tracy. Yes, this is her.  Alright, Tracy you logged a ticket. Ticket number 1803438 regarding the money that you wanted to allocate.  Yes. Can we do any discs? I don't think that I can get on that.  Alright, so you don't have any discs or I mean you cannot use any discs?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Capital Brain Center</span></b>:  No, but if you walk me through, I mean I'm when it comes to them taking a credit card through your<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ethan Rogers</span></b>:  things that I can see to allocate it. So, let me see. Bear with me.  Thank you so much for staying on the line. So, Tracy, I mean if there was any option we could do a screen share,  I mean that is something going to help me to assist you in a better way.  Either I can navigate you and alright let's see if it works.  So, the account number is 3936 for Kamma McCarrie. Yes, I'm already on it. <span style=""color:red""><b>  Alright, so if you go to the payments and the very third date of service which is minus $17</b></span>.25.  So, first of all we need to take out this amount. So, we will click on the date of service, 8-25,  and where you see the CPT code, ST date of service, charged, balanced, allowed, paid. Can you see that?  Yes, and so I would edit it?  Yep. So, you will post here, I mean you will add minus $17.25 in the paid and refund.  You will click tab twice or thrice and then you can add the comments moving the amount of $17.25 to other date of service and then we will post.  Okay, this is the only way to do this?  I'm afraid, but yes, this is the only option.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Capital Brain Center</span></b>:  Are you guys going to, are you working on trying to do it like it used to be where we could actually edit it and not have to do this negative or is this the way it's going to be always now?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ethan Rogers</span></b>:  For now, this is going to be like an editable option, but there is a possibility, I'm not sure about it, but there is a possibility in our next version since this is the 10G version.  Our upcoming version is 11G version and there are going to be a lot more options and a lot more things added in the new version, but still I'm not sure if it is going to be implemented in 11G version or not.  But still this is not an editable option for now until or unless we implement our new version, which is 11G.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Capital Brain Center</span></b>:  Okay, okay.

I was just testing.  I am just looking to test if this is happening on specific patient.  Yeah.  Also, Dawn, are you using QM-D on Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge?  I'm Chrome.  Okay.  Good time to load.  I know.  It's one of those days.  It's Monday.  Yeah.  Maybe that's the reason.  No, no.  That's what it is.  Okay.  So, this is coming on test AMI.  We have one example.  Can we go back, please?  Mm-hmm.  Firstly, I was just checking if this is something related to the layouts in QM-D, but seems  like that's not the case.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Wayne County Health Department</span></b>:  Right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Simon Lee</span></b>:  Can you type something and see what comes up?

Let's do something here.  Can you close?  Can you log out here, Andy, please?  Can you log back in?  Yeah.  I think your screen is closed.  Can you share the screen again, please?  Let me...  Mm-hmm.  Hold on a second.  It's coming back up.  Yeah.  I can see it now.  Have you logged it out?  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Wayne County Health Department</span></b>:  I logged out and logged back in.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Simon Lee</span></b>:  Can you close the window?

Could you clear your browser history for the past four weeks, if that's possible?  Yeah.  I did that earlier, too.  You did that?  Mm-hmm.  I did.  Okay.  So, first thing was changing the layout.  Second thing was testing it.  It's happening on feed-patient kids.  The thing is, Dawn, when I tried to reproduce this at my end, I was able to get into the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Wayne County Health Department</span></b>:  notes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Simon Lee</span></b>:  So, this is something related to your user profile.

I would have to go through some kind of steps of verification.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  With patient thought?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I would take a Google account, the Google Business account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We did Google Ads through them.  And they needed access to the actual account.  So I gave them, I think, managing rights,  something like that, as a manager. <span style=""color:red""><b>  So they could log in and get them</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Understood.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So if I have the password or if I  have a computer, I can log in and business account  without entering my name and password.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, if you can do that, I believe  if you sign out and then try clicking on Forgot Password,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  then you should get a password.  Oh, you're right.  Yeah.  OK.  Do you want to wait while I try doing it?  Or should I try to do it again?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Well, doctor, if you're with patients right now,  we can set up a call to do this another time.  But if you have time right now, we can do it right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No, I have time right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  No, I'm not going to.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.

You think that's great?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Oh, it says that the session was closed by the remote user.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think you might have accidentally  hit Escape or something.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm reconnecting.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I can see your screen.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Have you received your user login credentials  for the reputation management?  For your reputation management account?  For my account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  For your account?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Yes, from us.  We should have sent this to you.  If you haven't, actually, let me quickly check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I see that you do have an account.  I'm going to send you a password reset email.  You should get this on eva.golsteyn at gmail.com.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.  And once you have that, I will let me just take.  I got it.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Now, the little settings cog in the top right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Oops.  Just knocking things over.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And then we go to Google.  And then we click on Connect.  And now, so here is where you would  click on Use Another Account and enter your location's  Google account credentials.  So to do that, if you could try resetting your password  for your location's Google account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I'm sorry.  I didn't know what I needed to do.  I need to hop on.  OK.  I think I believe that's it.  I think I'm going to go back to the Google account.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I think I believe if you were to,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  let me take controls for a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  I think if you click on the top right where this E is a  bearing, so you're logged into your personal email</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Is your personal email also used for your Google My Business<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  email?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  Are the two emails the same?</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Let's click on Continue.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Go on Sign In.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  To be honest, it looks like your credentials are the same  for your GMB page and your...  Hold on.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Add a user or not?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Can we change the email on that?  So it's looking a lot like your...  I'm not entirely certain how this works,  but it's looking like you're either added as a user to your  GMB account or your personal email address is the same as  your location's Google account's email address,  is what I feel is happening.  I'm actually Googling right now.  Could you let me have the controls for a second?  Doctor, the current Gmail account that you're using,  can we try and see if it works here?  Is it sure?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think it's working.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Well, let's skip this for now.  And it's been added.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm going to take this and I will copy the link address.  We go over here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We scroll to seven.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Excellent.  All right.  Doctor, are there any other review sites that you wanted  to also be able to send review requests on?  So a review request is basically a request sent to a  patient to leave a review on either Google or Facebook or<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  CareDash.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So would you also want to be able to...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Do you have a Facebook page?  I have.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So it's just Google so far.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Nice.  So it's confirmed that your reviews are populating.  Basically, yes.  And here we go.  All right.  Excellent.  Your old reviews at least have populated in the application.  Excellent.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Do you... <span style=""color:red""><b>  Where is the scheduler?  Sorry, the scheduler?</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So the reputation management platform doesn't have a  scheduler.  I think that what you're asking about is either like  online scheduling or digital check-in or those things.  My domain is mostly just reputation management.  For the rest of your product, I believe that either  someone from our premium services team will reach out<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  to you for those things.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Do you want me to set up a meeting for you and the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  premium services team?  They can assign a representative for the rest of your  novel health product?  Yes, that would be nice</b></span>.  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I will make sure that I do that.  So the next step is I'm going to send out an email to<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  I'm going to make a list of all the appointment reasons  that you have in your QMd application</b></span>.  And I'm going to ask you in that email which of those  appointment reasons you want patients should receive a<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  review request for.  Would it be all of them?  Probably, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, all of the appointment reasons.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So the next few steps, doctor, because the client  facing, you being the client, the client facing  configuration has been done. <span style=""color:red""><b>  The next few steps are going to be a good deal of  back-end configuration because what we're doing is  this platform with your QMd so that when a patient is  checked out on the scheduler there, their information is  automatically uploaded here in the contacts module,</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  which I believe might already be happening.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'll confirm on the status for this.  And when that happens, we can set up another automation.  We can set up another automation whereby patients  are automatically sent review requests just by<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  arriving in this application.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I am going to give you a quick look at the templates<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  that are used.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Basically, this is what the review request text is<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  going to look like.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  This is what patients are going to see.  The reason I pulled this up is because I wanted to ask  you if there's anything that you would want to change  over here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No, this is good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Nice, that's fine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we'll select Google over here so that the Google<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  link is created as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We'll unselect this for now.  Your experience wasn't great.  We want to make it right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.  Hold on one second, Nasti.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I just want to see the bottom of the page.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Can you see?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'll show you what it looks like.  It isn't entirely clear what it's going to look like.  Just give me one second while I set this up.  I'll show you exactly what it looks like.  So if the review request is sent via text message,  this is how it's going to appear.  Hi, contact first name.  Thank you for choosing Eva Galsian, Family Medicine NYC.  Please provide your feedback by clicking the link below.  Once they click the link, they will be sent onto this  page or this screen where they will see two links.  One is Review Us on Google.  And the second link is if your experience wasn't great,  contact us directly.  If they were to click on Review Us on Google,  let me show you what that would look like.  It's from your Gmail account.  That's fine.  But I can tell you what it would look like, the review page.  And if they click on Contact Us Directly, they will see this.  This is a mini form that they're going to fill out. <span style=""color:red""><b>  And when they click on Submit over here, this screen,  and then this feedback, it's sent directly to you as opposed  to appearing as a public review</b></span>.  Right, so it's going to end up in your inbox.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Got it, perfect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Or it can also end up in your reviews module.  But it's going to be different.  The icon over here instead of this G for Google is going to,  it's hard for me to describe it, but the icon will be different  for direct feedback as opposed to public reviews.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And let me confirm a couple of other things as well.  So these are categories that will basically show you what you're going to see.  So these are categories that will basically show in third party listings. <span style=""color:red""><b>  Third party listings are basically any sites where your practice has any information about itself,  like the practice's name or the practice's address or something like that</b></span>.  So you would find this information on sites like Apple Maps or Uber  or multiple other websites that display listings for medical practices.  We can ensure that the information being displayed on all of those listings is uniform and consistent.  But in order to do that, we need to complete the information that needs to be added  to your business profile and the reputation management platform.  So what, doctor, what would you say your primary category would be?  The primary category for your...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  What are the options?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We have nurse practitioner, primary care, dentist, primary dental care, podiatrist, primary podiatrist.  So medical... <span style=""color:red""><b>  Should we leave it general and then as an additional care, if I put in family medicine,</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  so what's a bearing medicine?  I don't know where the sleep special is.  I don't know why that is as well, actually.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Maybe because this family doctor, family medicine, we can find something else.  Primary care clinic, general medicine doctor.  Family practice physician.  Is that something that...  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  All right. Excellent.  So that's one.  Okay. So some of these keywords are too long.  Oh, absolutely.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  I changed it.  Okay. Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm just going to remove some of the longer keywords here. <span style=""color:red""><b>  Allergy testing, skin testing, delete environmental allergies over here</b></span>.  Let's delete blood for food allergies.  I think we can remove the parentheses.  So keywords are supposed to be just that, short and very, very to the point.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Hold on one second.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So travel consultation is probably fairly misleading.  So we can just include... <span style=""color:red""><b>  No, we can keep the vaccinations and travel medications, but remove travel consultation</b></span>.  We don't have to delete all of this. We can convert those into keywords.  So we just remove the parenthesis. Just give me one second.  Let's do this.  Let's delete if needed over here. <span style=""color:red""><b>  And we can delete vaccines as well</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can delete the and.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We've lost pre-exposure. This is fine.  We can.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think we can delete all of this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Unless we add treatments after.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  One second. Let's see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Would this be COVID testing or COVID treatment?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can do.  I don't think it's treatment.  We can remove.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Infections.  Asymptote treatment.  Dominal pain treatment.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can delete this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Work removal functional medicine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we can delete this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  There we go.  Okay.  Then a different keyword for a keyword.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we can delete this.  And great. I think that should do it.  That's safe.  Let's see if that fixes it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  So,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm assuming that the information that we put in here is correct.  And what I'm looking to do now is to push this information out to your Google My Business listing.  Do you not want me to update this on your Google?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I'm going to go to the website.  Okay.  This should be working.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So, what I'm going to do now is to make sure that the website works.  Under actions on the listing page, you get this option here that says force sync.  And that pushes the information in your system, this information, across all of these listings.  Wherever you have information present in any of these websites, it will make sure that that information is correct across all of these listings.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So, we'll return to this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Thank you so much, Dr. Wilson. You've been really, really helpful.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We've actually got a major chunk of the work out of the way.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  Next steps are, we're going to create an interface between your reputation management platform and CureMD</b></span>.  To set up the automation where patient information comes to this platform automatically when a patient is checked out in the CureMD application.  We're going to, we'll go ahead and test that.  And once that is complete, I'll get in touch with you.  And I can give you a brief training on all the modules that you see before you.  We can also completely set this up so that this is completely automatic from end to end.  Even if it can be replied to automatically from within the reputation management platform.  And we set that up, I can actually show you right now where we set that up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay, that sounds good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Alright, thank you so much.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Sorry, go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  You're welcome. <span style=""color:red""><b>  Please ask whoever is in charge for the first part to contact you</b></span>.  Sure, I'll reach out to someone from Premium Services to speak to you about the online scheduling, I believe is what you're inquiring about.  I'll have someone reach out to you.  Perfect, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.  Thanks a lot for helping Doctor. Have a good day.  Have a good day.<br>","Billing Invoice, EDI PM, Diagnosis, Quality Programs, Provider Notes, Prescriptions, Scheduling, Labs, Interfaces","<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Hello, this is Dr. Goldstein.  Hi, Dr. Goldstein.  This is Hasim calling from QMZ.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm calling with, I'm doing very well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  How are you?  Good, thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So I wanted to speak to you just to give you  clarity on what's happening.  Your existing implementation specialist  for reputation management had to leave the organization  without giving prior notice because of a life event.  So I'm taking over your project, your reputation management<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  project here on out.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, so my question is, I've taken a look at your account.  It seems that it has been, at least the basic configurations<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  have been done.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I wanted to inquire exactly what you feel  is bending from our end and where in the time.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  And but before, once he's ready, next so he can,  I don't know, implement it, I don't know,  merge into the website.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, so that's specifically for online scheduling.  What I'm talking about is reputation management,  where you send, where patients are going to send you reviews  on Google, on like public websites,  where you send out review requests to the patients<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  and they send.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So that has little to do with the website.  So this is something that you would assist me in setting up.  So I just wanted to basically clarify.  I'm looking at your account right now.

So I have to reach out to the credentials.  But if I recall correctly, I have to give them permission.  I would have to go through some kind of steps of verification.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  With patient thought?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I would take a Google account, the Google Business account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We did Google Ads through them.

Or should I try to do it again?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Well, doctor, if you're with patients right now,  we can set up a call to do this another time.  But if you have time right now, we can do it right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No, I have time right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  No, I'm not going to.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.  So can we do an AnyDesk session?  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.  Could you share your address?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  726.  Just one second.  Loading on my end.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  7233.  261.  261.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Got it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  It's saying connection in progress on my end.  Mm-hmm.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I see it.  You think that's great?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Oh, it says that the session was closed by the remote user.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think you might have accidentally  hit Escape or something.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm reconnecting.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I can see your screen.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Have you received your user login credentials  for the reputation management?  For your reputation management account?  For my account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  For your account?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Yes, from us.  We should have sent this to you.  If you haven't, actually, let me quickly check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I see that you do have an account.  I'm going to send you a password reset email.  You should get this on eva.golsteyn at gmail.com.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.  And once you have that, I will let me just take.  I got it.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Now, the little settings cog in the top right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Oops.  Just knocking things over.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And then we go to Google.  And then we click on Connect.  And now, so here is where you would  click on Use Another Account and enter your location's  Google account credentials.  So to do that, if you could try resetting your password  for your location's Google account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I'm sorry.  I didn't know what I needed to do.  I need to hop on.  OK.  I think I believe that's it.  I think I'm going to go back to the Google account.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I think I believe if you were to,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  let me take controls for a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I think if you click on the top right where this E is a  bearing, so you're logged into your personal email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Is your personal email also used for your Google My Business<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  email?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Are the two emails the same?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Let's click on Continue.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Go on Sign In.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  To be honest, it looks like your credentials are the same  for your GMB page and your...  Hold on.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Add a user or not?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Can we change the email on that?  So it's looking a lot like your...  I'm not entirely certain how this works,  but it's looking like you're either added as a user to your  GMB account or your personal email address is the same as  your location's Google account's email address,  is what I feel is happening.  I'm actually Googling right now.  Could you let me have the controls for a second?  Doctor, the current Gmail account that you're using,  can we try and see if it works here?  Is it sure?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think it's working.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Well, let's skip this for now.  And it's been added.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm going to take this and I will copy the link address.  We go over here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We scroll to seven.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Excellent.  All right.  Doctor, are there any other review sites that you wanted  to also be able to send review requests on?  So a review request is basically a request sent to a  patient to leave a review on either Google or Facebook or<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  CareDash.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So would you also want to be able to...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Do you have a Facebook page?  I have.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So it's just Google so far.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Nice.  So it's confirmed that your reviews are populating.  Basically, yes.  And here we go.  All right.  Excellent.  Your old reviews at least have populated in the application.  Excellent.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Do you...  Where is the scheduler?  Sorry, the scheduler?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So the reputation management platform doesn't have a  scheduler.  I think that what you're asking about is either like  online scheduling or digital check-in or those things.  My domain is mostly just reputation management.  For the rest of your product, I believe that either  someone from our premium services team will reach out<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  to you for those things.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Do you want me to set up a meeting for you and the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  premium services team?  They can assign a representative for the rest of your  novel health product?  Yes, that would be nice.  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I will make sure that I do that.  So the next step is I'm going to send out an email to<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm going to make a list of all the appointment reasons  that you have in your QMd application.  And I'm going to ask you in that email which of those  appointment reasons you want patients should receive a<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  review request for.  Would it be all of them?  Probably, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, all of the appointment reasons.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So the next few steps, doctor, because the client  facing, you being the client, the client facing  configuration has been done.  The next few steps are going to be a good deal of  back-end configuration because what we're doing is  this platform with your QMd so that when a patient is  checked out on the scheduler there, their information is  automatically uploaded here in the contacts module,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  which I believe might already be happening.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'll confirm on the status for this.  And when that happens, we can set up another automation.  We can set up another automation whereby patients  are automatically sent review requests just by<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  arriving in this application.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I am going to give you a quick look at the templates<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  that are used.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Basically, this is what the review request text is<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  going to look like.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  This is what patients are going to see.  The reason I pulled this up is because I wanted to ask  you if there's anything that you would want to change  over here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No, this is good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Nice, that's fine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we'll select Google over here so that the Google<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  link is created as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We'll unselect this for now.  Your experience wasn't great.  We want to make it right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.  Hold on one second, Nasti.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I just want to see the bottom of the page.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Can you see?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'll show you what it looks like.  It isn't entirely clear what it's going to look like.  Just give me one second while I set this up.  I'll show you exactly what it looks like.  So if the review request is sent via text message,  this is how it's going to appear.  Hi, contact first name.  Thank you for choosing Eva Galsian, Family Medicine NYC.  Please provide your feedback by clicking the link below.  Once they click the link, they will be sent onto this  page or this screen where they will see two links.  One is Review Us on Google.  And the second link is if your experience wasn't great,  contact us directly.  If they were to click on Review Us on Google,  let me show you what that would look like.  It's from your Gmail account.  That's fine.  But I can tell you what it would look like, the review page.  And if they click on Contact Us Directly, they will see this.  This is a mini form that they're going to fill out.  And when they click on Submit over here, this screen,  and then this feedback, it's sent directly to you as opposed  to appearing as a public review.  Right, so it's going to end up in your inbox.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Got it, perfect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Or it can also end up in your reviews module.  But it's going to be different.  The icon over here instead of this G for Google is going to,  it's hard for me to describe it, but the icon will be different  for direct feedback as opposed to public reviews.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And let me confirm a couple of other things as well.  So these are categories that will basically show you what you're going to see.  So these are categories that will basically show in third party listings.  Third party listings are basically any sites where your practice has any information about itself,  like the practice's name or the practice's address or something like that.  So you would find this information on sites like Apple Maps or Uber  or multiple other websites that display listings for medical practices.  We can ensure that the information being displayed on all of those listings is uniform and consistent.  But in order to do that, we need to complete the information that needs to be added  to your business profile and the reputation management platform.  So what, doctor, what would you say your primary category would be?  The primary category for your...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  What are the options?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We have nurse practitioner, primary care, dentist, primary dental care, podiatrist, primary podiatrist.  So medical...  Should we leave it general and then as an additional care, if I put in family medicine,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  so what's a bearing medicine?  I don't know where the sleep special is.  I don't know why that is as well, actually.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Maybe because this family doctor, family medicine, we can find something else.  Primary care clinic, general medicine doctor.  Family practice physician.  Is that something that...  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  All right. Excellent.  So that's one.  Okay. So some of these keywords are too long.  Oh, absolutely.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  I changed it.  Okay. Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm just going to remove some of the longer keywords here.  Allergy testing, skin testing, delete environmental allergies over here.  Let's delete blood for food allergies.  I think we can remove the parentheses.  So keywords are supposed to be just that, short and very, very to the point.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Hold on one second.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So travel consultation is probably fairly misleading.  So we can just include...  No, we can keep the vaccinations and travel medications, but remove travel consultation.  We don't have to delete all of this. We can convert those into keywords.  So we just remove the parenthesis. Just give me one second.  Let's do this.  Let's delete if needed over here.  And we can delete vaccines as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can delete the and.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We've lost pre-exposure. This is fine.  We can.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think we can delete all of this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Unless we add treatments after.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  One second. Let's see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Would this be COVID testing or COVID treatment?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can do.  I don't think it's treatment.  We can remove.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Infections.  Asymptote treatment.  Dominal pain treatment.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can delete this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Work removal functional medicine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we can delete this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  There we go.  Okay.  Then a different keyword for a keyword.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we can delete this.  And great. I think that should do it.  That's safe.  Let's see if that fixes it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  So,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm assuming that the information that we put in here is correct.  And what I'm looking to do now is to push this information out to your Google My Business listing.  Do you not want me to update this on your Google?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I'm going to go to the website.  Okay.  This should be working.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So, what I'm going to do now is to make sure that the website works.  Under actions on the listing page, you get this option here that says force sync.  And that pushes the information in your system, this information, across all of these listings.  Wherever you have information present in any of these websites, it will make sure that that information is correct across all of these listings.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So, we'll return to this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Thank you so much, Dr. Wilson. You've been really, really helpful.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We've actually got a major chunk of the work out of the way.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Next steps are, we're going to create an interface between your reputation management platform and CureMD.  To set up the automation where patient information comes to this platform automatically when a patient is checked out in the CureMD application.  We're going to, we'll go ahead and test that.  And once that is complete, I'll get in touch with you.  And I can give you a brief training on all the modules that you see before you.  We can also completely set this up so that this is completely automatic from end to end.  Even if it can be replied to automatically from within the reputation management platform.  And we set that up, I can actually show you right now where we set that up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay, that sounds good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Alright, thank you so much.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Sorry, go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  You're welcome. <span style=""color:red""><b>  Please ask whoever is in charge for the first part to contact you</b></span>.  Sure, I'll reach out to someone from Premium Services to speak to you about the online scheduling, I believe is what you're inquiring about.  I'll have someone reach out to you.  Perfect, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.  Thanks a lot for helping Doctor. Have a good day.  Have a good day.<br>",,"<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Hello, this is Dr. Goldstein.  Hi, Dr. Goldstein.  This is Hasim calling from QMZ.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm calling with, I'm doing very well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  How are you?  Good, thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So I wanted to speak to you just to give you  clarity on what's happening.  Your existing implementation specialist  for reputation management had to leave the organization  without giving prior notice because of a life event.  So I'm taking over your project, your reputation management<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  project here on out.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, so my question is, I've taken a look at your account.  It seems that it has been, at least the basic configurations<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  have been done.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I wanted to inquire exactly what you feel  is bending from our end and where in the time.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  And but before, once he's ready, next so he can,  I don't know, implement it, I don't know,  merge into the website.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, so that's specifically for online scheduling.  What I'm talking about is reputation management,  where you send, where patients are going to send you reviews  on Google, on like public websites,  where you send out review requests to the patients<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  and they send.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So that has little to do with the website.  So this is something that you would assist me in setting up.  So I just wanted to basically clarify.  I'm looking at your account right now.  And what we would need to do is to connect your Google My  Business, which is your Google Maps location to the reputation<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  management platform.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And in order for us to be able to do that,  you would need to have your account's login credentials.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  And so these are the login credentials<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  for the Google account of your business.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So this is your Google Maps location.  So I have to reach out to the credentials.  But if I recall correctly, I have to give them permission.  I would have to go through some kind of steps of verification.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  With patient thought?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I would take a Google account, the Google Business account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We did Google Ads through them.  And they needed access to the actual account.  So I gave them, I think, managing rights,  something like that, as a manager.  So they could log in and get them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Understood.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So if I have the password or if I  have a computer, I can log in and business account  without entering my name and password.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, if you can do that, I believe  if you sign out and then try clicking on Forgot Password,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  then you should get a password.  Oh, you're right.  Yeah.  OK.  Do you want to wait while I try doing it?  Or should I try to do it again?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Well, doctor, if you're with patients right now,  we can set up a call to do this another time.  But if you have time right now, we can do it right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No, I have time right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  No, I'm not going to.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.  So can we do an AnyDesk session?  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.  Could you share your address?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  726.  Just one second.  Loading on my end.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  7233.  261.  261.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Got it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  It's saying connection in progress on my end.  Mm-hmm.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I see it.  You think that's great?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Oh, it says that the session was closed by the remote user.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think you might have accidentally  hit Escape or something.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm reconnecting.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I can see your screen.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Have you received your user login credentials  for the reputation management?  For your reputation management account?  For my account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  For your account?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Yes, from us.  We should have sent this to you.  If you haven't, actually, let me quickly check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I see that you do have an account.  I'm going to send you a password reset email.  You should get this on eva.golsteyn at gmail.com.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.  And once you have that, I will let me just take.  I got it.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Now, the little settings cog in the top right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Oops.  Just knocking things over.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And then we go to Google.  And then we click on Connect.  And now, so here is where you would  click on Use Another Account and enter your location's  Google account credentials.  So to do that, if you could try resetting your password  for your location's Google account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I'm sorry.  I didn't know what I needed to do.  I need to hop on.  OK.  I think I believe that's it.  I think I'm going to go back to the Google account.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I think I believe if you were to,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  let me take controls for a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I think if you click on the top right where this E is a  bearing, so you're logged into your personal email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Is your personal email also used for your Google My Business<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  email?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Are the two emails the same?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Let's click on Continue.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Go on Sign In.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  To be honest, it looks like your credentials are the same  for your GMB page and your...  Hold on.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Add a user or not?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Can we change the email on that?  So it's looking a lot like your...  I'm not entirely certain how this works,  but it's looking like you're either added as a user to your  GMB account or your personal email address is the same as  your location's Google account's email address,  is what I feel is happening.  I'm actually Googling right now.  Could you let me have the controls for a second?  Doctor, the current Gmail account that you're using,  can we try and see if it works here?  Is it sure?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think it's working.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Well, let's skip this for now.  And it's been added.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm going to take this and I will copy the link address.  We go over here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We scroll to seven.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Excellent.  All right.  Doctor, are there any other review sites that you wanted  to also be able to send review requests on?  So a review request is basically a request sent to a  patient to leave a review on either Google or Facebook or<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  CareDash.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So would you also want to be able to...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Do you have a Facebook page?  I have.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So it's just Google so far.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Nice.  So it's confirmed that your reviews are populating.  Basically, yes.  And here we go.  All right.  Excellent.  Your old reviews at least have populated in the application.  Excellent.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Do you...  Where is the scheduler?  Sorry, the scheduler?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So the reputation management platform doesn't have a  scheduler.  I think that what you're asking about is either like  online scheduling or digital check-in or those things.  My domain is mostly just reputation management.  For the rest of your product, I believe that either  someone from our premium services team will reach out<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  to you for those things.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Do you want me to set up a meeting for you and the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  premium services team?  They can assign a representative for the rest of your  novel health product?  Yes, that would be nice.  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I will make sure that I do that.  So the next step is I'm going to send out an email to<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm going to make a list of all the appointment reasons  that you have in your QMd application.  And I'm going to ask you in that email which of those  appointment reasons you want patients should receive a<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  review request for.  Would it be all of them?  Probably, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, all of the appointment reasons.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So the next few steps, doctor, because the client  facing, you being the client, the client facing  configuration has been done.  The next few steps are going to be a good deal of  back-end configuration because what we're doing is  this platform with your QMd so that when a patient is  checked out on the scheduler there, their information is  automatically uploaded here in the contacts module,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  which I believe might already be happening.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'll confirm on the status for this.  And when that happens, we can set up another automation.  We can set up another automation whereby patients  are automatically sent review requests just by<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  arriving in this application.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I am going to give you a quick look at the templates<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  that are used.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Basically, this is what the review request text is<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  going to look like.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  This is what patients are going to see.  The reason I pulled this up is because I wanted to ask  you if there's anything that you would want to change  over here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No, this is good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Nice, that's fine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we'll select Google over here so that the Google<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  link is created as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We'll unselect this for now.  Your experience wasn't great.  We want to make it right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.  Hold on one second, Nasti.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I just want to see the bottom of the page.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Can you see?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'll show you what it looks like.  It isn't entirely clear what it's going to look like.  Just give me one second while I set this up.  I'll show you exactly what it looks like.  So if the review request is sent via text message,  this is how it's going to appear.  Hi, contact first name.  Thank you for choosing Eva Galsian, Family Medicine NYC.  Please provide your feedback by clicking the link below.  Once they click the link, they will be sent onto this  page or this screen where they will see two links.  One is Review Us on Google.  And the second link is if your experience wasn't great,  contact us directly.  If they were to click on Review Us on Google,  let me show you what that would look like.  It's from your Gmail account.  That's fine.  But I can tell you what it would look like, the review page.  And if they click on Contact Us Directly, they will see this.  This is a mini form that they're going to fill out.  And when they click on Submit over here, this screen,  and then this feedback, it's sent directly to you as opposed  to appearing as a public review.  Right, so it's going to end up in your inbox.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Got it, perfect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Or it can also end up in your reviews module.  But it's going to be different.  The icon over here instead of this G for Google is going to,  it's hard for me to describe it, but the icon will be different  for direct feedback as opposed to public reviews.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And let me confirm a couple of other things as well.  So these are categories that will basically show you what you're going to see.  So these are categories that will basically show in third party listings.  Third party listings are basically any sites where your practice has any information about itself,  like the practice's name or the practice's address or something like that.  So you would find this information on sites like Apple Maps or Uber  or multiple other websites that display listings for medical practices.  We can ensure that the information being displayed on all of those listings is uniform and consistent.  But in order to do that, we need to complete the information that needs to be added  to your business profile and the reputation management platform.  So what, doctor, what would you say your primary category would be?  The primary category for your...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  What are the options?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We have nurse practitioner, primary care, dentist, primary dental care, podiatrist, primary podiatrist.  So medical... <span style=""color:red""><b>  Should we leave it general and then as an additional care, if I put in family medicine,</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  so what's a bearing medicine?  I don't know where the sleep special is.  I don't know why that is as well, actually.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Maybe because this family doctor, family medicine, we can find something else.  Primary care clinic, general medicine doctor.  Family practice physician.  Is that something that...  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  All right. Excellent.  So that's one.  Okay. So some of these keywords are too long.  Oh, absolutely.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  I changed it.  Okay. Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm just going to remove some of the longer keywords here.  Allergy testing, skin testing, delete environmental allergies over here.  Let's delete blood for food allergies.  I think we can remove the parentheses.  So keywords are supposed to be just that, short and very, very to the point.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Hold on one second.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So travel consultation is probably fairly misleading.  So we can just include...  No, we can keep the vaccinations and travel medications, but remove travel consultation.  We don't have to delete all of this. We can convert those into keywords.  So we just remove the parenthesis. Just give me one second.  Let's do this.  Let's delete if needed over here.  And we can delete vaccines as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can delete the and.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We've lost pre-exposure. This is fine.  We can.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think we can delete all of this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Unless we add treatments after.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  One second. Let's see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Would this be COVID testing or COVID treatment?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can do.  I don't think it's treatment.  We can remove.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Infections.  Asymptote treatment.  Dominal pain treatment.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can delete this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Work removal functional medicine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we can delete this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  There we go.  Okay.  Then a different keyword for a keyword.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we can delete this.  And great. I think that should do it.  That's safe.  Let's see if that fixes it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  So,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm assuming that the information that we put in here is correct.  And what I'm looking to do now is to push this information out to your Google My Business listing.  Do you not want me to update this on your Google?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I'm going to go to the website.  Okay.  This should be working.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So, what I'm going to do now is to make sure that the website works.  Under actions on the listing page, you get this option here that says force sync.  And that pushes the information in your system, this information, across all of these listings.  Wherever you have information present in any of these websites, it will make sure that that information is correct across all of these listings.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So, we'll return to this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Thank you so much, Dr. Wilson. You've been really, really helpful.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We've actually got a major chunk of the work out of the way.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Next steps are, we're going to create an interface between your reputation management platform and CureMD.  To set up the automation where patient information comes to this platform automatically when a patient is checked out in the CureMD application.  We're going to, we'll go ahead and test that.  And once that is complete, I'll get in touch with you.  And I can give you a brief training on all the modules that you see before you.  We can also completely set this up so that this is completely automatic from end to end.  Even if it can be replied to automatically from within the reputation management platform.  And we set that up, I can actually show you right now where we set that up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay, that sounds good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Alright, thank you so much.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Sorry, go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  You're welcome.  Please ask whoever is in charge for the first part to contact you.  Sure, I'll reach out to someone from Premium Services to speak to you about the online scheduling, I believe is what you're inquiring about.  I'll have someone reach out to you.  Perfect, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.  Thanks a lot for helping Doctor. Have a good day.  Have a good day.<br>","<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Hello, this is Dr. Goldstein.  Hi, Dr. Goldstein.  This is Hasim calling from QMZ.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm calling with, I'm doing very well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  How are you?  Good, thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So I wanted to speak to you just to give you  clarity on what's happening.  Your existing implementation specialist  for reputation management had to leave the organization  without giving prior notice because of a life event.  So I'm taking over your project, your reputation management<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  project here on out.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, so my question is, I've taken a look at your account.  It seems that it has been, at least the basic configurations<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  have been done.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I wanted to inquire exactly what you feel  is bending from our end and where in the time.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  And but before, once he's ready, next so he can,  I don't know, implement it, I don't know,  merge into the website.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, so that's specifically for online scheduling.  What I'm talking about is reputation management,  where you send, where patients are going to send you reviews  on Google, on like public websites,  where you send out review requests to the patients<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  and they send.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So that has little to do with the website.  So this is something that you would assist me in setting up.  So I just wanted to basically clarify.  I'm looking at your account right now.  And what we would need to do is to connect your Google My  Business, which is your Google Maps location to the reputation<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  management platform.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And in order for us to be able to do that,  you would need to have your account's login credentials.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  And so these are the login credentials<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  for the Google account of your business.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So this is your Google Maps location.  So I have to reach out to the credentials.  But if I recall correctly, I have to give them permission.  I would have to go through some kind of steps of verification.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  With patient thought?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I would take a Google account, the Google Business account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We did Google Ads through them.  And they needed access to the actual account.  So I gave them, I think, managing rights,  something like that, as a manager.  So they could log in and get them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Understood.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So if I have the password or if I  have a computer, I can log in and business account  without entering my name and password.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, if you can do that, I believe  if you sign out and then try clicking on Forgot Password,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  then you should get a password.  Oh, you're right.  Yeah.  OK.  Do you want to wait while I try doing it?  Or should I try to do it again?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Well, doctor, if you're with patients right now,  we can set up a call to do this another time.  But if you have time right now, we can do it right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No, I have time right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  No, I'm not going to.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.  So can we do an AnyDesk session?  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.  Could you share your address?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  726.  Just one second.  Loading on my end.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  7233.  261.  261.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Got it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  It's saying connection in progress on my end.  Mm-hmm.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I see it.  You think that's great?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Oh, it says that the session was closed by the remote user.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think you might have accidentally  hit Escape or something.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm reconnecting.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I can see your screen.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Have you received your user login credentials  for the reputation management?  For your reputation management account?  For my account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  For your account?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Yes, from us.  We should have sent this to you.  If you haven't, actually, let me quickly check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I see that you do have an account.  I'm going to send you a password reset email.  You should get this on eva.golsteyn at gmail.com.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.  And once you have that, I will let me just take.  I got it.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Now, the little settings cog in the top right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Oops.  Just knocking things over.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And then we go to Google.  And then we click on Connect.  And now, so here is where you would  click on Use Another Account and enter your location's  Google account credentials.  So to do that, if you could try resetting your password  for your location's Google account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I'm sorry.

Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Is your personal email also used for your Google My Business<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  email?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Are the two emails the same?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Let's click on Continue.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Go on Sign In.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  To be honest, it looks like your credentials are the same  for your GMB page and your...  Hold on.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Add a user or not?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Can we change the email on that?  So it's looking a lot like your...  I'm not entirely certain how this works,  but it's looking like you're either added as a user to your  GMB account or your personal email address is the same as  your location's Google account's email address,  is what I feel is happening.  I'm actually Googling right now.  Could you let me have the controls for a second?  Doctor, the current Gmail account that you're using,  can we try and see if it works here?  Is it sure?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think it's working.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Well, let's skip this for now.  And it's been added.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm going to take this and I will copy the link address.  We go over here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We scroll to seven.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Excellent.  All right.  Doctor, are there any other review sites that you wanted  to also be able to send review requests on?  So a review request is basically a request sent to a  patient to leave a review on either Google or Facebook or<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  CareDash.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So would you also want to be able to...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Do you have a Facebook page?  I have.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So it's just Google so far.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Nice.  So it's confirmed that your reviews are populating.  Basically, yes.  And here we go.  All right.  Excellent.  Your old reviews at least have populated in the application.  Excellent.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Do you... <span style=""color:red""><b>  Where is the scheduler?  Sorry, the scheduler?</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So the reputation management platform doesn't have a  scheduler.  I think that what you're asking about is either like  online scheduling or digital check-in or those things.  My domain is mostly just reputation management.  For the rest of your product, I believe that either  someone from our premium services team will reach out<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  to you for those things.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Do you want me to set up a meeting for you and the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  premium services team?  They can assign a representative for the rest of your  novel health product?  Yes, that would be nice.  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I will make sure that I do that.  So the next step is I'm going to send out an email to<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  I'm going to make a list of all the appointment reasons  that you have in your QMd application</b></span>.  And I'm going to ask you in that email which of those  appointment reasons you want patients should receive a<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  review request for.  Would it be all of them?  Probably, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, all of the appointment reasons.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So the next few steps, doctor, because the client  facing, you being the client, the client facing  configuration has been done.  The next few steps are going to be a good deal of  back-end configuration because what we're doing is  this platform with your QMd so that when a patient is  checked out on the scheduler there, their information is  automatically uploaded here in the contacts module,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  which I believe might already be happening.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'll confirm on the status for this.  And when that happens, we can set up another automation.  We can set up another automation whereby patients  are automatically sent review requests just by<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  arriving in this application.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I am going to give you a quick look at the templates<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  that are used.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Basically, this is what the review request text is<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  going to look like.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  This is what patients are going to see.  The reason I pulled this up is because I wanted to ask  you if there's anything that you would want to change  over here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No, this is good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Nice, that's fine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we'll select Google over here so that the Google<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  link is created as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We'll unselect this for now.  Your experience wasn't great.  We want to make it right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.  Hold on one second, Nasti.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I just want to see the bottom of the page.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Can you see?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'll show you what it looks like.  It isn't entirely clear what it's going to look like.  Just give me one second while I set this up.  I'll show you exactly what it looks like.  So if the review request is sent via text message,  this is how it's going to appear.  Hi, contact first name.  Thank you for choosing Eva Galsian, Family Medicine NYC.  Please provide your feedback by clicking the link below.  Once they click the link, they will be sent onto this  page or this screen where they will see two links.  One is Review Us on Google.  And the second link is if your experience wasn't great,  contact us directly.  If they were to click on Review Us on Google,  let me show you what that would look like.  It's from your Gmail account.  That's fine.  But I can tell you what it would look like, the review page.  And if they click on Contact Us Directly, they will see this.  This is a mini form that they're going to fill out.  And when they click on Submit over here, this screen,  and then this feedback, it's sent directly to you as opposed  to appearing as a public review.  Right, so it's going to end up in your inbox.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Got it, perfect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Or it can also end up in your reviews module.  But it's going to be different.  The icon over here instead of this G for Google is going to,  it's hard for me to describe it, but the icon will be different  for direct feedback as opposed to public reviews.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And let me confirm a couple of other things as well.  So these are categories that will basically show you what you're going to see.  So these are categories that will basically show in third party listings.  Third party listings are basically any sites where your practice has any information about itself,  like the practice's name or the practice's address or something like that.  So you would find this information on sites like Apple Maps or Uber  or multiple other websites that display listings for medical practices.  We can ensure that the information being displayed on all of those listings is uniform and consistent.  But in order to do that, we need to complete the information that needs to be added  to your business profile and the reputation management platform.  So what, doctor, what would you say your primary category would be?  The primary category for your...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  What are the options?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We have nurse practitioner, primary care, dentist, primary dental care, podiatrist, primary podiatrist.  So medical...  Should we leave it general and then as an additional care, if I put in family medicine,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  so what's a bearing medicine?  I don't know where the sleep special is.  I don't know why that is as well, actually.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Maybe because this family doctor, family medicine, we can find something else.  Primary care clinic, general medicine doctor.  Family practice physician.  Is that something that...  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  All right. Excellent.  So that's one.  Okay. So some of these keywords are too long.  Oh, absolutely.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  I changed it.  Okay. Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm just going to remove some of the longer keywords here.  Allergy testing, skin testing, delete environmental allergies over here.  Let's delete blood for food allergies.  I think we can remove the parentheses.  So keywords are supposed to be just that, short and very, very to the point.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Hold on one second.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So travel consultation is probably fairly misleading.  So we can just include...  No, we can keep the vaccinations and travel medications, but remove travel consultation.  We don't have to delete all of this. We can convert those into keywords.  So we just remove the parenthesis. Just give me one second.  Let's do this.  Let's delete if needed over here.  And we can delete vaccines as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can delete the and.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We've lost pre-exposure. This is fine.  We can.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think we can delete all of this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Unless we add treatments after.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  One second. Let's see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Would this be COVID testing or COVID treatment?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can do.  I don't think it's treatment.  We can remove.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Infections.  Asymptote treatment.  Dominal pain treatment.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can delete this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Work removal functional medicine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we can delete this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  There we go.  Okay.  Then a different keyword for a keyword.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we can delete this.  And great. I think that should do it.  That's safe.  Let's see if that fixes it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  So,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm assuming that the information that we put in here is correct.  And what I'm looking to do now is to push this information out to your Google My Business listing.  Do you not want me to update this on your Google?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I'm going to go to the website.  Okay.  This should be working.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So, what I'm going to do now is to make sure that the website works.  Under actions on the listing page, you get this option here that says force sync.  And that pushes the information in your system, this information, across all of these listings.  Wherever you have information present in any of these websites, it will make sure that that information is correct across all of these listings.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So, we'll return to this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Thank you so much, Dr. Wilson. You've been really, really helpful.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We've actually got a major chunk of the work out of the way.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Next steps are, we're going to create an interface between your reputation management platform and CureMD.  To set up the automation where patient information comes to this platform automatically when a patient is checked out in the CureMD application.  We're going to, we'll go ahead and test that.  And once that is complete, I'll get in touch with you.  And I can give you a brief training on all the modules that you see before you.  We can also completely set this up so that this is completely automatic from end to end.  Even if it can be replied to automatically from within the reputation management platform.  And we set that up, I can actually show you right now where we set that up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay, that sounds good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Alright, thank you so much.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Sorry, go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  You're welcome.  Please ask whoever is in charge for the first part to contact you.  Sure, I'll reach out to someone from Premium Services to speak to you about the online scheduling, I believe is what you're inquiring about.  I'll have someone reach out to you.  Perfect, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.  Thanks a lot for helping Doctor. Have a good day.  Have a good day.<br>","<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Hello, this is Dr. Goldstein.  Hi, Dr. Goldstein.  This is Hasim calling from QMZ.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm calling with, I'm doing very well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  How are you?  Good, thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So I wanted to speak to you just to give you  clarity on what's happening.  Your existing implementation specialist  for reputation management had to leave the organization  without giving prior notice because of a life event.  So I'm taking over your project, your reputation management<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  project here on out.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, so my question is, I've taken a look at your account.  It seems that it has been, at least the basic configurations<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  have been done.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I wanted to inquire exactly what you feel  is bending from our end and where in the time.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  And but before, once he's ready, next so he can,  I don't know, implement it, I don't know,  merge into the website.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, so that's specifically for online scheduling.  What I'm talking about is reputation management,  where you send, where patients are going to send you reviews  on Google, on like public websites,  where you send out review requests to the patients<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  and they send.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So that has little to do with the website.  So this is something that you would assist me in setting up.  So I just wanted to basically clarify.  I'm looking at your account right now.  And what we would need to do is to connect your Google My  Business, which is your Google Maps location to the reputation<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  management platform.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And in order for us to be able to do that,  you would need to have your account's login credentials.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  And so these are the login credentials<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  for the Google account of your business.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So this is your Google Maps location.  So I have to reach out to the credentials.  But if I recall correctly, I have to give them permission.  I would have to go through some kind of steps of verification.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  With patient thought?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I would take a Google account, the Google Business account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We did Google Ads through them.  And they needed access to the actual account.  So I gave them, I think, managing rights,  something like that, as a manager. <span style=""color:red""><b>  So they could log in and get them</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Understood.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So if I have the password or if I  have a computer, I can log in and business account  without entering my name and password.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, if you can do that, I believe  if you sign out and then try clicking on Forgot Password,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  then you should get a password.  Oh, you're right.  Yeah.  OK.  Do you want to wait while I try doing it?  Or should I try to do it again?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Well, doctor, if you're with patients right now,  we can set up a call to do this another time.  But if you have time right now, we can do it right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No, I have time right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  No, I'm not going to.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.  So can we do an AnyDesk session?  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.  Could you share your address?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  726.  Just one second.  Loading on my end.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  7233.  261.  261.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Got it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  It's saying connection in progress on my end.  Mm-hmm.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I see it.  You think that's great?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Oh, it says that the session was closed by the remote user.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think you might have accidentally  hit Escape or something.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm reconnecting.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I can see your screen.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Have you received your user login credentials  for the reputation management?  For your reputation management account?  For my account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  For your account?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Yes, from us.  We should have sent this to you.  If you haven't, actually, let me quickly check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I see that you do have an account.  I'm going to send you a password reset email.  You should get this on eva.golsteyn at gmail.com.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.  And once you have that, I will let me just take.  I got it.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Now, the little settings cog in the top right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Oops.  Just knocking things over.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And then we go to Google.  And then we click on Connect.  And now, so here is where you would  click on Use Another Account and enter your location's  Google account credentials.  So to do that, if you could try resetting your password  for your location's Google account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I'm sorry.  I didn't know what I needed to do.  I need to hop on.  OK.  I think I believe that's it.  I think I'm going to go back to the Google account.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I think I believe if you were to,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  let me take controls for a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I think if you click on the top right where this E is a  bearing, so you're logged into your personal email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Is your personal email also used for your Google My Business<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  email?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  Are the two emails the same?</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Let's click on Continue.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Go on Sign In.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  To be honest, it looks like your credentials are the same  for your GMB page and your...  Hold on.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Add a user or not?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Can we change the email on that?  So it's looking a lot like your...  I'm not entirely certain how this works,  but it's looking like you're either added as a user to your  GMB account or your personal email address is the same as  your location's Google account's email address,  is what I feel is happening.  I'm actually Googling right now.  Could you let me have the controls for a second?  Doctor, the current Gmail account that you're using,  can we try and see if it works here?  Is it sure?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think it's working.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Well, let's skip this for now.  And it's been added.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm going to take this and I will copy the link address.  We go over here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We scroll to seven.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Excellent.  All right.  Doctor, are there any other review sites that you wanted  to also be able to send review requests on?  So a review request is basically a request sent to a  patient to leave a review on either Google or Facebook or<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  CareDash.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So would you also want to be able to...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Do you have a Facebook page?  I have.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So it's just Google so far.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Nice.  So it's confirmed that your reviews are populating.  Basically, yes.  And here we go.  All right.  Excellent.  Your old reviews at least have populated in the application.  Excellent.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Do you...  Where is the scheduler?  Sorry, the scheduler?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So the reputation management platform doesn't have a  scheduler.  I think that what you're asking about is either like  online scheduling or digital check-in or those things.  My domain is mostly just reputation management.  For the rest of your product, I believe that either  someone from our premium services team will reach out<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  to you for those things.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Do you want me to set up a meeting for you and the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  premium services team?  They can assign a representative for the rest of your  novel health product?  Yes, that would be nice.  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I will make sure that I do that.  So the next step is I'm going to send out an email to<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm going to make a list of all the appointment reasons  that you have in your QMd application.  And I'm going to ask you in that email which of those  appointment reasons you want patients should receive a<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  review request for.  Would it be all of them?  Probably, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, all of the appointment reasons.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So the next few steps, doctor, because the client  facing, you being the client, the client facing  configuration has been done.  The next few steps are going to be a good deal of  back-end configuration because what we're doing is  this platform with your QMd so that when a patient is  checked out on the scheduler there, their information is  automatically uploaded here in the contacts module,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  which I believe might already be happening.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'll confirm on the status for this.  And when that happens, we can set up another automation.  We can set up another automation whereby patients  are automatically sent review requests just by<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  arriving in this application.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I am going to give you a quick look at the templates<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  that are used.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Basically, this is what the review request text is<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  going to look like.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  This is what patients are going to see.  The reason I pulled this up is because I wanted to ask  you if there's anything that you would want to change  over here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No, this is good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Nice, that's fine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we'll select Google over here so that the Google<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  link is created as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We'll unselect this for now.  Your experience wasn't great.  We want to make it right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.  Hold on one second, Nasti.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I just want to see the bottom of the page.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Can you see?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'll show you what it looks like.  It isn't entirely clear what it's going to look like.  Just give me one second while I set this up.  I'll show you exactly what it looks like.  So if the review request is sent via text message,  this is how it's going to appear.  Hi, contact first name.  Thank you for choosing Eva Galsian, Family Medicine NYC.  Please provide your feedback by clicking the link below.  Once they click the link, they will be sent onto this  page or this screen where they will see two links.  One is Review Us on Google.  And the second link is if your experience wasn't great,  contact us directly.  If they were to click on Review Us on Google,  let me show you what that would look like.  It's from your Gmail account.  That's fine.  But I can tell you what it would look like, the review page.  And if they click on Contact Us Directly, they will see this.  This is a mini form that they're going to fill out.  And when they click on Submit over here, this screen,  and then this feedback, it's sent directly to you as opposed  to appearing as a public review.  Right, so it's going to end up in your inbox.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Got it, perfect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Or it can also end up in your reviews module.  But it's going to be different.  The icon over here instead of this G for Google is going to,  it's hard for me to describe it, but the icon will be different  for direct feedback as opposed to public reviews.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And let me confirm a couple of other things as well.  So these are categories that will basically show you what you're going to see.  So these are categories that will basically show in third party listings.  Third party listings are basically any sites where your practice has any information about itself,  like the practice's name or the practice's address or something like that.  So you would find this information on sites like Apple Maps or Uber  or multiple other websites that display listings for medical practices.  We can ensure that the information being displayed on all of those listings is uniform and consistent.  But in order to do that, we need to complete the information that needs to be added  to your business profile and the reputation management platform.  So what, doctor, what would you say your primary category would be?  The primary category for your...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  What are the options?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We have nurse practitioner, primary care, dentist, primary dental care, podiatrist, primary podiatrist.  So medical...  Should we leave it general and then as an additional care, if I put in family medicine,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  so what's a bearing medicine?  I don't know where the sleep special is.  I don't know why that is as well, actually.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Maybe because this family doctor, family medicine, we can find something else.  Primary care clinic, general medicine doctor.  Family practice physician.  Is that something that...  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  All right. Excellent.  So that's one.  Okay. So some of these keywords are too long.  Oh, absolutely.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  I changed it.  Okay. Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm just going to remove some of the longer keywords here.  Allergy testing, skin testing, delete environmental allergies over here.  Let's delete blood for food allergies.  I think we can remove the parentheses.  So keywords are supposed to be just that, short and very, very to the point.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Hold on one second.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So travel consultation is probably fairly misleading.  So we can just include...  No, we can keep the vaccinations and travel medications, but remove travel consultation.  We don't have to delete all of this. We can convert those into keywords.  So we just remove the parenthesis. Just give me one second.  Let's do this.  Let's delete if needed over here. <span style=""color:red""><b>  And we can delete vaccines as well</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can delete the and.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We've lost pre-exposure. This is fine.  We can.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think we can delete all of this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Unless we add treatments after.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  One second. Let's see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Would this be COVID testing or COVID treatment?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can do.  I don't think it's treatment.  We can remove.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Infections.  Asymptote treatment.  Dominal pain treatment.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can delete this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Work removal functional medicine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we can delete this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  There we go.  Okay.  Then a different keyword for a keyword.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we can delete this.  And great. I think that should do it.  That's safe.  Let's see if that fixes it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  So,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm assuming that the information that we put in here is correct.  And what I'm looking to do now is to push this information out to your Google My Business listing.  Do you not want me to update this on your Google?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I'm going to go to the website.  Okay.  This should be working.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So, what I'm going to do now is to make sure that the website works.  Under actions on the listing page, you get this option here that says force sync.  And that pushes the information in your system, this information, across all of these listings.  Wherever you have information present in any of these websites, it will make sure that that information is correct across all of these listings.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So, we'll return to this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Thank you so much, Dr. Wilson. You've been really, really helpful.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We've actually got a major chunk of the work out of the way.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Next steps are, we're going to create an interface between your reputation management platform and CureMD.  To set up the automation where patient information comes to this platform automatically when a patient is checked out in the CureMD application.  We're going to, we'll go ahead and test that.  And once that is complete, I'll get in touch with you.  And I can give you a brief training on all the modules that you see before you.  We can also completely set this up so that this is completely automatic from end to end.  Even if it can be replied to automatically from within the reputation management platform.  And we set that up, I can actually show you right now where we set that up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay, that sounds good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Alright, thank you so much.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Sorry, go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  You're welcome.  Please ask whoever is in charge for the first part to contact you.  Sure, I'll reach out to someone from Premium Services to speak to you about the online scheduling, I believe is what you're inquiring about.  I'll have someone reach out to you.  Perfect, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.  Thanks a lot for helping Doctor. Have a good day.  Have a good day.<br>","<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Hello, this is Dr. Goldstein.  Hi, Dr. Goldstein.  This is Hasim calling from QMZ.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm calling with, I'm doing very well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  How are you?  Good, thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So I wanted to speak to you just to give you  clarity on what's happening.  Your existing implementation specialist  for reputation management had to leave the organization  without giving prior notice because of a life event.  So I'm taking over your project, your reputation management<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  project here on out.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, so my question is, I've taken a look at your account.  It seems that it has been, at least the basic configurations<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  have been done.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I wanted to inquire exactly what you feel  is bending from our end and where in the time.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  And but before, once he's ready, next so he can,  I don't know, implement it, I don't know,  merge into the website.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, so that's specifically for online scheduling.  What I'm talking about is reputation management,  where you send, where patients are going to send you reviews  on Google, on like public websites,  where you send out review requests to the patients<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  and they send.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So that has little to do with the website.  So this is something that you would assist me in setting up.  So I just wanted to basically clarify.  I'm looking at your account right now.  And what we would need to do is to connect your Google My  Business, which is your Google Maps location to the reputation<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  management platform.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And in order for us to be able to do that,  you would need to have your account's login credentials.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  And so these are the login credentials<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  for the Google account of your business.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So this is your Google Maps location.  So I have to reach out to the credentials.  But if I recall correctly, I have to give them permission.  I would have to go through some kind of steps of verification.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  With patient thought?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I would take a Google account, the Google Business account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We did Google Ads through them.  And they needed access to the actual account.  So I gave them, I think, managing rights,  something like that, as a manager.  So they could log in and get them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Understood.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So if I have the password or if I  have a computer, I can log in and business account  without entering my name and password.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, if you can do that, I believe  if you sign out and then try clicking on Forgot Password,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  then you should get a password.  Oh, you're right.  Yeah.  OK.  Do you want to wait while I try doing it?  Or should I try to do it again?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Well, doctor, if you're with patients right now,  we can set up a call to do this another time.  But if you have time right now, we can do it right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No, I have time right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  No, I'm not going to.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.  So can we do an AnyDesk session?  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.  Could you share your address?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  726.  Just one second.  Loading on my end.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  7233.  261.  261.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Got it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  It's saying connection in progress on my end.  Mm-hmm.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I see it.  You think that's great?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Oh, it says that the session was closed by the remote user.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think you might have accidentally  hit Escape or something.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm reconnecting.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I can see your screen.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Have you received your user login credentials  for the reputation management?  For your reputation management account?  For my account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  For your account?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Yes, from us.  We should have sent this to you.  If you haven't, actually, let me quickly check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I see that you do have an account.  I'm going to send you a password reset email.  You should get this on eva.golsteyn at gmail.com.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.  And once you have that, I will let me just take.  I got it.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Now, the little settings cog in the top right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Oops.  Just knocking things over.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And then we go to Google.  And then we click on Connect.  And now, so here is where you would  click on Use Another Account and enter your location's  Google account credentials.  So to do that, if you could try resetting your password  for your location's Google account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I'm sorry.  I didn't know what I needed to do.  I need to hop on.  OK.  I think I believe that's it.  I think I'm going to go back to the Google account.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I think I believe if you were to,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  let me take controls for a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I think if you click on the top right where this E is a  bearing, so you're logged into your personal email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Is your personal email also used for your Google My Business<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  email?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Are the two emails the same?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Let's click on Continue.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Go on Sign In.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  To be honest, it looks like your credentials are the same  for your GMB page and your...  Hold on.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Add a user or not?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Can we change the email on that?  So it's looking a lot like your...  I'm not entirely certain how this works,  but it's looking like you're either added as a user to your  GMB account or your personal email address is the same as  your location's Google account's email address,  is what I feel is happening.  I'm actually Googling right now.  Could you let me have the controls for a second?  Doctor, the current Gmail account that you're using,  can we try and see if it works here?  Is it sure?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think it's working.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Well, let's skip this for now.  And it's been added.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm going to take this and I will copy the link address.  We go over here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We scroll to seven.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Excellent.  All right.  Doctor, are there any other review sites that you wanted  to also be able to send review requests on?  So a review request is basically a request sent to a  patient to leave a review on either Google or Facebook or<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  CareDash.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So would you also want to be able to...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Do you have a Facebook page?  I have.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So it's just Google so far.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Nice.  So it's confirmed that your reviews are populating.  Basically, yes.  And here we go.  All right.  Excellent.  Your old reviews at least have populated in the application.  Excellent.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Do you...  Where is the scheduler?  Sorry, the scheduler?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So the reputation management platform doesn't have a  scheduler.  I think that what you're asking about is either like  online scheduling or digital check-in or those things.  My domain is mostly just reputation management.  For the rest of your product, I believe that either  someone from our premium services team will reach out<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  to you for those things.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Do you want me to set up a meeting for you and the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  premium services team?  They can assign a representative for the rest of your  novel health product?  Yes, that would be nice.  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I will make sure that I do that.  So the next step is I'm going to send out an email to<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm going to make a list of all the appointment reasons  that you have in your QMd application.  And I'm going to ask you in that email which of those  appointment reasons you want patients should receive a<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  review request for.  Would it be all of them?  Probably, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, all of the appointment reasons.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So the next few steps, doctor, because the client  facing, you being the client, the client facing  configuration has been done.  The next few steps are going to be a good deal of  back-end configuration because what we're doing is  this platform with your QMd so that when a patient is  checked out on the scheduler there, their information is  automatically uploaded here in the contacts module,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  which I believe might already be happening.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'll confirm on the status for this.  And when that happens, we can set up another automation.  We can set up another automation whereby patients  are automatically sent review requests just by<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  arriving in this application.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I am going to give you a quick look at the templates<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  that are used.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Basically, this is what the review request text is<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  going to look like.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  This is what patients are going to see.  The reason I pulled this up is because I wanted to ask  you if there's anything that you would want to change  over here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No, this is good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Nice, that's fine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we'll select Google over here so that the Google<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  link is created as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We'll unselect this for now.  Your experience wasn't great.  We want to make it right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.  Hold on one second, Nasti.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I just want to see the bottom of the page.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Can you see?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'll show you what it looks like.  It isn't entirely clear what it's going to look like.  Just give me one second while I set this up.  I'll show you exactly what it looks like.  So if the review request is sent via text message,  this is how it's going to appear.  Hi, contact first name.  Thank you for choosing Eva Galsian, Family Medicine NYC.  Please provide your feedback by clicking the link below.  Once they click the link, they will be sent onto this  page or this screen where they will see two links.  One is Review Us on Google.  And the second link is if your experience wasn't great,  contact us directly.  If they were to click on Review Us on Google,  let me show you what that would look like.  It's from your Gmail account.  That's fine.  But I can tell you what it would look like, the review page.  And if they click on Contact Us Directly, they will see this.  This is a mini form that they're going to fill out.  And when they click on Submit over here, this screen,  and then this feedback, it's sent directly to you as opposed  to appearing as a public review.  Right, so it's going to end up in your inbox.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Got it, perfect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Or it can also end up in your reviews module.  But it's going to be different.  The icon over here instead of this G for Google is going to,  it's hard for me to describe it, but the icon will be different  for direct feedback as opposed to public reviews.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And let me confirm a couple of other things as well.  So these are categories that will basically show you what you're going to see.  So these are categories that will basically show in third party listings.  Third party listings are basically any sites where your practice has any information about itself,  like the practice's name or the practice's address or something like that.  So you would find this information on sites like Apple Maps or Uber  or multiple other websites that display listings for medical practices.  We can ensure that the information being displayed on all of those listings is uniform and consistent.  But in order to do that, we need to complete the information that needs to be added  to your business profile and the reputation management platform.  So what, doctor, what would you say your primary category would be?  The primary category for your...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  What are the options?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We have nurse practitioner, primary care, dentist, primary dental care, podiatrist, primary podiatrist.  So medical...  Should we leave it general and then as an additional care, if I put in family medicine,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  so what's a bearing medicine?  I don't know where the sleep special is.  I don't know why that is as well, actually.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Maybe because this family doctor, family medicine, we can find something else.  Primary care clinic, general medicine doctor.  Family practice physician.  Is that something that...  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  All right. Excellent.  So that's one.  Okay. So some of these keywords are too long.  Oh, absolutely.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  I changed it.  Okay. Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm just going to remove some of the longer keywords here.  Allergy testing, skin testing, delete environmental allergies over here.  Let's delete blood for food allergies.  I think we can remove the parentheses.  So keywords are supposed to be just that, short and very, very to the point.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Hold on one second.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So travel consultation is probably fairly misleading.  So we can just include...  No, we can keep the vaccinations and travel medications, but remove travel consultation.  We don't have to delete all of this. We can convert those into keywords.  So we just remove the parenthesis. Just give me one second.  Let's do this.  Let's delete if needed over here.  And we can delete vaccines as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can delete the and.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We've lost pre-exposure. This is fine.  We can.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think we can delete all of this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Unless we add treatments after.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  One second. Let's see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Would this be COVID testing or COVID treatment?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can do.  I don't think it's treatment.  We can remove.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Infections.  Asymptote treatment.  Dominal pain treatment.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can delete this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Work removal functional medicine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we can delete this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  There we go.  Okay.  Then a different keyword for a keyword.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we can delete this.  And great. I think that should do it.  That's safe.  Let's see if that fixes it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  So,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm assuming that the information that we put in here is correct.  And what I'm looking to do now is to push this information out to your Google My Business listing.  Do you not want me to update this on your Google?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I'm going to go to the website.  Okay.  This should be working.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So, what I'm going to do now is to make sure that the website works.  Under actions on the listing page, you get this option here that says force sync.  And that pushes the information in your system, this information, across all of these listings.  Wherever you have information present in any of these websites, it will make sure that that information is correct across all of these listings.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So, we'll return to this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Thank you so much, Dr. Wilson. You've been really, really helpful.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We've actually got a major chunk of the work out of the way.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  Next steps are, we're going to create an interface between your reputation management platform and CureMD</b></span>.  To set up the automation where patient information comes to this platform automatically when a patient is checked out in the CureMD application.  We're going to, we'll go ahead and test that.  And once that is complete, I'll get in touch with you.  And I can give you a brief training on all the modules that you see before you.  We can also completely set this up so that this is completely automatic from end to end.  Even if it can be replied to automatically from within the reputation management platform.  And we set that up, I can actually show you right now where we set that up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay, that sounds good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Alright, thank you so much.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Sorry, go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  You're welcome.  Please ask whoever is in charge for the first part to contact you.  Sure, I'll reach out to someone from Premium Services to speak to you about the online scheduling, I believe is what you're inquiring about.  I'll have someone reach out to you.  Perfect, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.  Thanks a lot for helping Doctor. Have a good day.  Have a good day.<br>","<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Hello, this is Dr. Goldstein.  Hi, Dr. Goldstein.  This is Hasim calling from QMZ.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm calling with, I'm doing very well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  How are you?  Good, thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So I wanted to speak to you just to give you  clarity on what's happening.  Your existing implementation specialist  for reputation management had to leave the organization  without giving prior notice because of a life event.  So I'm taking over your project, your reputation management<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  project here on out.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, so my question is, I've taken a look at your account.  It seems that it has been, at least the basic configurations<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  have been done.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I wanted to inquire exactly what you feel  is bending from our end and where in the time.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  And but before, once he's ready, next so he can,  I don't know, implement it, I don't know,  merge into the website.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, so that's specifically for online scheduling.  What I'm talking about is reputation management,  where you send, where patients are going to send you reviews  on Google, on like public websites,  where you send out review requests to the patients<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  and they send.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So that has little to do with the website.  So this is something that you would assist me in setting up.  So I just wanted to basically clarify.  I'm looking at your account right now.  And what we would need to do is to connect your Google My  Business, which is your Google Maps location to the reputation<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  management platform.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And in order for us to be able to do that,  you would need to have your account's login credentials.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  And so these are the login credentials<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  for the Google account of your business.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So this is your Google Maps location.  So I have to reach out to the credentials.  But if I recall correctly, I have to give them permission.  I would have to go through some kind of steps of verification.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  With patient thought?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I would take a Google account, the Google Business account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We did Google Ads through them.  And they needed access to the actual account.  So I gave them, I think, managing rights,  something like that, as a manager.  So they could log in and get them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Understood.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So if I have the password or if I  have a computer, I can log in and business account  without entering my name and password.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, if you can do that, I believe  if you sign out and then try clicking on Forgot Password,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  then you should get a password.  Oh, you're right.  Yeah.  OK.  Do you want to wait while I try doing it?  Or should I try to do it again?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Well, doctor, if you're with patients right now,  we can set up a call to do this another time.  But if you have time right now, we can do it right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No, I have time right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  No, I'm not going to.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.  So can we do an AnyDesk session?  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.  Could you share your address?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  726.  Just one second.  Loading on my end.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  7233.  261.  261.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Got it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  It's saying connection in progress on my end.  Mm-hmm.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I see it.  You think that's great?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Oh, it says that the session was closed by the remote user.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think you might have accidentally  hit Escape or something.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm reconnecting.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I can see your screen.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Have you received your user login credentials  for the reputation management?  For your reputation management account?  For my account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  For your account?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Yes, from us.  We should have sent this to you.  If you haven't, actually, let me quickly check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I see that you do have an account.  I'm going to send you a password reset email.  You should get this on eva.golsteyn at gmail.com.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.  And once you have that, I will let me just take.  I got it.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Now, the little settings cog in the top right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Oops.  Just knocking things over.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And then we go to Google.  And then we click on Connect.  And now, so here is where you would  click on Use Another Account and enter your location's  Google account credentials.  So to do that, if you could try resetting your password  for your location's Google account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I'm sorry.  I didn't know what I needed to do.  I need to hop on.  OK.  I think I believe that's it.  I think I'm going to go back to the Google account.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I think I believe if you were to,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  let me take controls for a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I think if you click on the top right where this E is a  bearing, so you're logged into your personal email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Is your personal email also used for your Google My Business<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  email?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Are the two emails the same?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Let's click on Continue.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Go on Sign In.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  To be honest, it looks like your credentials are the same  for your GMB page and your...  Hold on.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Add a user or not?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Can we change the email on that?  So it's looking a lot like your...  I'm not entirely certain how this works,  but it's looking like you're either added as a user to your  GMB account or your personal email address is the same as  your location's Google account's email address,  is what I feel is happening.  I'm actually Googling right now.  Could you let me have the controls for a second?  Doctor, the current Gmail account that you're using,  can we try and see if it works here?  Is it sure?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think it's working.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Well, let's skip this for now.  And it's been added.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm going to take this and I will copy the link address.  We go over here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We scroll to seven.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Excellent.  All right.  Doctor, are there any other review sites that you wanted  to also be able to send review requests on?  So a review request is basically a request sent to a  patient to leave a review on either Google or Facebook or<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  CareDash.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So would you also want to be able to...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Do you have a Facebook page?  I have.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So it's just Google so far.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Nice.  So it's confirmed that your reviews are populating.  Basically, yes.  And here we go.  All right.  Excellent.  Your old reviews at least have populated in the application.  Excellent.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Do you...  Where is the scheduler?  Sorry, the scheduler?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So the reputation management platform doesn't have a  scheduler.  I think that what you're asking about is either like  online scheduling or digital check-in or those things.  My domain is mostly just reputation management.  For the rest of your product, I believe that either  someone from our premium services team will reach out<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  to you for those things.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Do you want me to set up a meeting for you and the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  premium services team?  They can assign a representative for the rest of your  novel health product?  Yes, that would be nice.  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I will make sure that I do that.  So the next step is I'm going to send out an email to<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm going to make a list of all the appointment reasons  that you have in your QMd application.  And I'm going to ask you in that email which of those  appointment reasons you want patients should receive a<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  review request for.  Would it be all of them?  Probably, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, all of the appointment reasons.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So the next few steps, doctor, because the client  facing, you being the client, the client facing  configuration has been done.  The next few steps are going to be a good deal of  back-end configuration because what we're doing is  this platform with your QMd so that when a patient is  checked out on the scheduler there, their information is  automatically uploaded here in the contacts module,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  which I believe might already be happening.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'll confirm on the status for this.  And when that happens, we can set up another automation.  We can set up another automation whereby patients  are automatically sent review requests just by<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  arriving in this application.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I am going to give you a quick look at the templates<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  that are used.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Basically, this is what the review request text is<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  going to look like.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  This is what patients are going to see.  The reason I pulled this up is because I wanted to ask  you if there's anything that you would want to change  over here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No, this is good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Nice, that's fine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we'll select Google over here so that the Google<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  link is created as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We'll unselect this for now.  Your experience wasn't great.  We want to make it right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.  Hold on one second, Nasti.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I just want to see the bottom of the page.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Can you see?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'll show you what it looks like.  It isn't entirely clear what it's going to look like.  Just give me one second while I set this up.  I'll show you exactly what it looks like.  So if the review request is sent via text message,  this is how it's going to appear.  Hi, contact first name.  Thank you for choosing Eva Galsian, Family Medicine NYC.  Please provide your feedback by clicking the link below.  Once they click the link, they will be sent onto this  page or this screen where they will see two links.  One is Review Us on Google.  And the second link is if your experience wasn't great,  contact us directly.  If they were to click on Review Us on Google,  let me show you what that would look like.  It's from your Gmail account.  That's fine.  But I can tell you what it would look like, the review page.  And if they click on Contact Us Directly, they will see this.  This is a mini form that they're going to fill out.  And when they click on Submit over here, this screen,  and then this feedback, it's sent directly to you as opposed  to appearing as a public review.  Right, so it's going to end up in your inbox.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Got it, perfect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Or it can also end up in your reviews module.  But it's going to be different.  The icon over here instead of this G for Google is going to,  it's hard for me to describe it, but the icon will be different  for direct feedback as opposed to public reviews.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And let me confirm a couple of other things as well.  So these are categories that will basically show you what you're going to see.  So these are categories that will basically show in third party listings.  Third party listings are basically any sites where your practice has any information about itself,  like the practice's name or the practice's address or something like that.  So you would find this information on sites like Apple Maps or Uber  or multiple other websites that display listings for medical practices.  We can ensure that the information being displayed on all of those listings is uniform and consistent.  But in order to do that, we need to complete the information that needs to be added  to your business profile and the reputation management platform.  So what, doctor, what would you say your primary category would be?  The primary category for your...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  What are the options?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We have nurse practitioner, primary care, dentist, primary dental care, podiatrist, primary podiatrist.  So medical...  Should we leave it general and then as an additional care, if I put in family medicine,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  so what's a bearing medicine?  I don't know where the sleep special is.  I don't know why that is as well, actually.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Maybe because this family doctor, family medicine, we can find something else.  Primary care clinic, general medicine doctor.  Family practice physician.  Is that something that...  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  All right. Excellent.  So that's one.  Okay. So some of these keywords are too long.  Oh, absolutely.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  I changed it.  Okay. Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm just going to remove some of the longer keywords here.  Allergy testing, skin testing, delete environmental allergies over here.  Let's delete blood for food allergies.  I think we can remove the parentheses.  So keywords are supposed to be just that, short and very, very to the point.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Hold on one second.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So travel consultation is probably fairly misleading.  So we can just include... <span style=""color:red""><b>  No, we can keep the vaccinations and travel medications, but remove travel consultation</b></span>.  We don't have to delete all of this. We can convert those into keywords.  So we just remove the parenthesis. Just give me one second.  Let's do this.  Let's delete if needed over here.  And we can delete vaccines as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can delete the and.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We've lost pre-exposure. This is fine.  We can.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think we can delete all of this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Unless we add treatments after.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  One second. Let's see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Would this be COVID testing or COVID treatment?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can do.  I don't think it's treatment.  We can remove.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Infections.  Asymptote treatment.  Dominal pain treatment.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can delete this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Work removal functional medicine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we can delete this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  There we go.  Okay.  Then a different keyword for a keyword.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we can delete this.  And great. I think that should do it.  That's safe.  Let's see if that fixes it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  So,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm assuming that the information that we put in here is correct.  And what I'm looking to do now is to push this information out to your Google My Business listing.  Do you not want me to update this on your Google?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I'm going to go to the website.  Okay.  This should be working.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So, what I'm going to do now is to make sure that the website works.  Under actions on the listing page, you get this option here that says force sync.  And that pushes the information in your system, this information, across all of these listings.  Wherever you have information present in any of these websites, it will make sure that that information is correct across all of these listings.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So, we'll return to this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Thank you so much, Dr. Wilson. You've been really, really helpful.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We've actually got a major chunk of the work out of the way.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Next steps are, we're going to create an interface between your reputation management platform and CureMD.  To set up the automation where patient information comes to this platform automatically when a patient is checked out in the CureMD application.  We're going to, we'll go ahead and test that.  And once that is complete, I'll get in touch with you.  And I can give you a brief training on all the modules that you see before you.  We can also completely set this up so that this is completely automatic from end to end.  Even if it can be replied to automatically from within the reputation management platform.  And we set that up, I can actually show you right now where we set that up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay, that sounds good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Alright, thank you so much.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Sorry, go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  You're welcome.  Please ask whoever is in charge for the first part to contact you.  Sure, I'll reach out to someone from Premium Services to speak to you about the online scheduling, I believe is what you're inquiring about.  I'll have someone reach out to you.  Perfect, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.  Thanks a lot for helping Doctor. Have a good day.  Have a good day.<br>","<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Hello, this is Dr. Goldstein.  Hi, Dr. Goldstein.  This is Hasim calling from QMZ.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm calling with, I'm doing very well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  How are you?  Good, thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So I wanted to speak to you just to give you  clarity on what's happening.  Your existing implementation specialist  for reputation management had to leave the organization  without giving prior notice because of a life event.  So I'm taking over your project, your reputation management<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  project here on out.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, so my question is, I've taken a look at your account.  It seems that it has been, at least the basic configurations<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  have been done.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I wanted to inquire exactly what you feel  is bending from our end and where in the time.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  And but before, once he's ready, next so he can,  I don't know, implement it, I don't know,  merge into the website.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, so that's specifically for online scheduling.  What I'm talking about is reputation management,  where you send, where patients are going to send you reviews  on Google, on like public websites,  where you send out review requests to the patients<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  and they send.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So that has little to do with the website.  So this is something that you would assist me in setting up.  So I just wanted to basically clarify.  I'm looking at your account right now.  And what we would need to do is to connect your Google My  Business, which is your Google Maps location to the reputation<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  management platform.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And in order for us to be able to do that,  you would need to have your account's login credentials.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  And so these are the login credentials<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  for the Google account of your business.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So this is your Google Maps location.  So I have to reach out to the credentials.  But if I recall correctly, I have to give them permission.  I would have to go through some kind of steps of verification.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  With patient thought?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I would take a Google account, the Google Business account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We did Google Ads through them.  And they needed access to the actual account.  So I gave them, I think, managing rights,  something like that, as a manager.  So they could log in and get them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Understood.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So if I have the password or if I  have a computer, I can log in and business account  without entering my name and password.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, if you can do that, I believe  if you sign out and then try clicking on Forgot Password,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  then you should get a password.  Oh, you're right.  Yeah.  OK.  Do you want to wait while I try doing it?  Or should I try to do it again?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Well, doctor, if you're with patients right now,  we can set up a call to do this another time.  But if you have time right now, we can do it right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No, I have time right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  No, I'm not going to.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.  So can we do an AnyDesk session?  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.  Could you share your address?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  726.  Just one second.  Loading on my end.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  7233.  261.  261.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Got it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  It's saying connection in progress on my end.  Mm-hmm.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I see it.  You think that's great?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Oh, it says that the session was closed by the remote user.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think you might have accidentally  hit Escape or something.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm reconnecting.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I can see your screen.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Have you received your user login credentials  for the reputation management?  For your reputation management account?  For my account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  For your account?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Yes, from us.  We should have sent this to you.  If you haven't, actually, let me quickly check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I see that you do have an account.  I'm going to send you a password reset email.  You should get this on eva.golsteyn at gmail.com.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.  And once you have that, I will let me just take.  I got it.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Now, the little settings cog in the top right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Oops.  Just knocking things over.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And then we go to Google.  And then we click on Connect.  And now, so here is where you would  click on Use Another Account and enter your location's  Google account credentials.  So to do that, if you could try resetting your password  for your location's Google account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I'm sorry.  I didn't know what I needed to do.  I need to hop on.  OK.  I think I believe that's it.  I think I'm going to go back to the Google account.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I think I believe if you were to,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  let me take controls for a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I think if you click on the top right where this E is a  bearing, so you're logged into your personal email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Is your personal email also used for your Google My Business<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  email?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Are the two emails the same?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Let's click on Continue.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Go on Sign In.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  To be honest, it looks like your credentials are the same  for your GMB page and your...  Hold on.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Add a user or not?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Can we change the email on that?  So it's looking a lot like your...  I'm not entirely certain how this works,  but it's looking like you're either added as a user to your  GMB account or your personal email address is the same as  your location's Google account's email address,  is what I feel is happening.  I'm actually Googling right now.  Could you let me have the controls for a second?  Doctor, the current Gmail account that you're using,  can we try and see if it works here?  Is it sure?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think it's working.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Well, let's skip this for now.  And it's been added.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm going to take this and I will copy the link address.  We go over here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We scroll to seven.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Excellent.  All right.  Doctor, are there any other review sites that you wanted  to also be able to send review requests on?  So a review request is basically a request sent to a  patient to leave a review on either Google or Facebook or<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  CareDash.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So would you also want to be able to...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Do you have a Facebook page?  I have.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So it's just Google so far.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Nice.  So it's confirmed that your reviews are populating.  Basically, yes.  And here we go.  All right.  Excellent.  Your old reviews at least have populated in the application.  Excellent.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Do you...  Where is the scheduler?  Sorry, the scheduler?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So the reputation management platform doesn't have a  scheduler.  I think that what you're asking about is either like  online scheduling or digital check-in or those things.  My domain is mostly just reputation management.  For the rest of your product, I believe that either  someone from our premium services team will reach out<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  to you for those things.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Do you want me to set up a meeting for you and the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  premium services team?  They can assign a representative for the rest of your  novel health product?  Yes, that would be nice</b></span>.  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I will make sure that I do that.  So the next step is I'm going to send out an email to<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm going to make a list of all the appointment reasons  that you have in your QMd application.  And I'm going to ask you in that email which of those  appointment reasons you want patients should receive a<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  review request for.  Would it be all of them?  Probably, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, all of the appointment reasons.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So the next few steps, doctor, because the client  facing, you being the client, the client facing  configuration has been done. <span style=""color:red""><b>  The next few steps are going to be a good deal of  back-end configuration because what we're doing is  this platform with your QMd so that when a patient is  checked out on the scheduler there, their information is  automatically uploaded here in the contacts module,</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  which I believe might already be happening.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'll confirm on the status for this.  And when that happens, we can set up another automation.  We can set up another automation whereby patients  are automatically sent review requests just by<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  arriving in this application.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I am going to give you a quick look at the templates<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  that are used.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Basically, this is what the review request text is<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  going to look like.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  This is what patients are going to see.  The reason I pulled this up is because I wanted to ask  you if there's anything that you would want to change  over here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No, this is good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Nice, that's fine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we'll select Google over here so that the Google<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  link is created as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We'll unselect this for now.  Your experience wasn't great.  We want to make it right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.  Hold on one second, Nasti.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I just want to see the bottom of the page.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Can you see?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'll show you what it looks like.  It isn't entirely clear what it's going to look like.  Just give me one second while I set this up.  I'll show you exactly what it looks like.  So if the review request is sent via text message,  this is how it's going to appear.  Hi, contact first name.  Thank you for choosing Eva Galsian, Family Medicine NYC.  Please provide your feedback by clicking the link below.  Once they click the link, they will be sent onto this  page or this screen where they will see two links.  One is Review Us on Google.  And the second link is if your experience wasn't great,  contact us directly.  If they were to click on Review Us on Google,  let me show you what that would look like.  It's from your Gmail account.  That's fine.  But I can tell you what it would look like, the review page.  And if they click on Contact Us Directly, they will see this.  This is a mini form that they're going to fill out. <span style=""color:red""><b>  And when they click on Submit over here, this screen,  and then this feedback, it's sent directly to you as opposed  to appearing as a public review</b></span>.  Right, so it's going to end up in your inbox.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Got it, perfect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Or it can also end up in your reviews module.  But it's going to be different.  The icon over here instead of this G for Google is going to,  it's hard for me to describe it, but the icon will be different  for direct feedback as opposed to public reviews.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And let me confirm a couple of other things as well.  So these are categories that will basically show you what you're going to see.  So these are categories that will basically show in third party listings.  Third party listings are basically any sites where your practice has any information about itself,  like the practice's name or the practice's address or something like that.  So you would find this information on sites like Apple Maps or Uber  or multiple other websites that display listings for medical practices.  We can ensure that the information being displayed on all of those listings is uniform and consistent.  But in order to do that, we need to complete the information that needs to be added  to your business profile and the reputation management platform.  So what, doctor, what would you say your primary category would be?  The primary category for your...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  What are the options?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We have nurse practitioner, primary care, dentist, primary dental care, podiatrist, primary podiatrist.  So medical...  Should we leave it general and then as an additional care, if I put in family medicine,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  so what's a bearing medicine?  I don't know where the sleep special is.  I don't know why that is as well, actually.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Maybe because this family doctor, family medicine, we can find something else.  Primary care clinic, general medicine doctor.  Family practice physician.  Is that something that...  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  All right. Excellent.  So that's one.  Okay. So some of these keywords are too long.  Oh, absolutely.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  I changed it.  Okay. Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm just going to remove some of the longer keywords here.  Allergy testing, skin testing, delete environmental allergies over here.  Let's delete blood for food allergies.  I think we can remove the parentheses.  So keywords are supposed to be just that, short and very, very to the point.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Hold on one second.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So travel consultation is probably fairly misleading.  So we can just include...  No, we can keep the vaccinations and travel medications, but remove travel consultation.  We don't have to delete all of this. We can convert those into keywords.  So we just remove the parenthesis. Just give me one second.  Let's do this.  Let's delete if needed over here.  And we can delete vaccines as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can delete the and.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We've lost pre-exposure. This is fine.  We can.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think we can delete all of this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Unless we add treatments after.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  One second. Let's see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Would this be COVID testing or COVID treatment?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can do.  I don't think it's treatment.  We can remove.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Infections.  Asymptote treatment.  Dominal pain treatment.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can delete this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Work removal functional medicine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we can delete this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  There we go.  Okay.  Then a different keyword for a keyword.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we can delete this.  And great. I think that should do it.  That's safe.  Let's see if that fixes it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  So,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm assuming that the information that we put in here is correct.  And what I'm looking to do now is to push this information out to your Google My Business listing.  Do you not want me to update this on your Google?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I'm going to go to the website.  Okay.  This should be working.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So, what I'm going to do now is to make sure that the website works.  Under actions on the listing page, you get this option here that says force sync.  And that pushes the information in your system, this information, across all of these listings.  Wherever you have information present in any of these websites, it will make sure that that information is correct across all of these listings.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So, we'll return to this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Thank you so much, Dr. Wilson. You've been really, really helpful.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We've actually got a major chunk of the work out of the way.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Next steps are, we're going to create an interface between your reputation management platform and CureMD.  To set up the automation where patient information comes to this platform automatically when a patient is checked out in the CureMD application.  We're going to, we'll go ahead and test that.  And once that is complete, I'll get in touch with you.  And I can give you a brief training on all the modules that you see before you.  We can also completely set this up so that this is completely automatic from end to end.  Even if it can be replied to automatically from within the reputation management platform.  And we set that up, I can actually show you right now where we set that up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay, that sounds good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Alright, thank you so much.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Sorry, go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  You're welcome.  Please ask whoever is in charge for the first part to contact you.  Sure, I'll reach out to someone from Premium Services to speak to you about the online scheduling, I believe is what you're inquiring about.  I'll have someone reach out to you.  Perfect, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.  Thanks a lot for helping Doctor. Have a good day.  Have a good day.<br>","<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Hello, this is Dr. Goldstein.  Hi, Dr. Goldstein.  This is Hasim calling from QMZ.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm calling with, I'm doing very well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  How are you?  Good, thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So I wanted to speak to you just to give you  clarity on what's happening.  Your existing implementation specialist  for reputation management had to leave the organization  without giving prior notice because of a life event.  So I'm taking over your project, your reputation management<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  project here on out.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, so my question is, I've taken a look at your account.  It seems that it has been, at least the basic configurations<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  have been done.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I wanted to inquire exactly what you feel  is bending from our end and where in the time.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  And but before, once he's ready, next so he can,  I don't know, implement it, I don't know,  merge into the website.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, so that's specifically for online scheduling.  What I'm talking about is reputation management,  where you send, where patients are going to send you reviews  on Google, on like public websites,  where you send out review requests to the patients<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  and they send.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So that has little to do with the website.  So this is something that you would assist me in setting up.  So I just wanted to basically clarify.  I'm looking at your account right now.  And what we would need to do is to connect your Google My  Business, which is your Google Maps location to the reputation<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  management platform.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And in order for us to be able to do that,  you would need to have your account's login credentials.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  And so these are the login credentials<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  for the Google account of your business.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So this is your Google Maps location.  So I have to reach out to the credentials.  But if I recall correctly, I have to give them permission.  I would have to go through some kind of steps of verification.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  With patient thought?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I would take a Google account, the Google Business account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We did Google Ads through them.  And they needed access to the actual account.  So I gave them, I think, managing rights,  something like that, as a manager.  So they could log in and get them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Understood.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So if I have the password or if I  have a computer, I can log in and business account  without entering my name and password.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, if you can do that, I believe  if you sign out and then try clicking on Forgot Password,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  then you should get a password.  Oh, you're right.  Yeah.  OK.  Do you want to wait while I try doing it?  Or should I try to do it again?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Well, doctor, if you're with patients right now,  we can set up a call to do this another time.  But if you have time right now, we can do it right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No, I have time right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  No, I'm not going to.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.  So can we do an AnyDesk session?  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.  Could you share your address?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  726.  Just one second.  Loading on my end.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  7233.  261.  261.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Got it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  It's saying connection in progress on my end.  Mm-hmm.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I see it.  You think that's great?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Oh, it says that the session was closed by the remote user.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think you might have accidentally  hit Escape or something.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm reconnecting.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I can see your screen.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Have you received your user login credentials  for the reputation management?  For your reputation management account?  For my account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  For your account?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Yes, from us.  We should have sent this to you.  If you haven't, actually, let me quickly check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I see that you do have an account.  I'm going to send you a password reset email.  You should get this on eva.golsteyn at gmail.com.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.  And once you have that, I will let me just take.  I got it.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Now, the little settings cog in the top right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Oops.  Just knocking things over.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And then we go to Google.  And then we click on Connect.  And now, so here is where you would  click on Use Another Account and enter your location's  Google account credentials.  So to do that, if you could try resetting your password  for your location's Google account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I'm sorry.  I didn't know what I needed to do.  I need to hop on.  OK.  I think I believe that's it.  I think I'm going to go back to the Google account.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I think I believe if you were to,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  let me take controls for a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  I think if you click on the top right where this E is a  bearing, so you're logged into your personal email</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Is your personal email also used for your Google My Business<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  email?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Are the two emails the same?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Let's click on Continue.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Go on Sign In.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  To be honest, it looks like your credentials are the same  for your GMB page and your...  Hold on.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Add a user or not?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Can we change the email on that?  So it's looking a lot like your...  I'm not entirely certain how this works,  but it's looking like you're either added as a user to your  GMB account or your personal email address is the same as  your location's Google account's email address,  is what I feel is happening.  I'm actually Googling right now.  Could you let me have the controls for a second?  Doctor, the current Gmail account that you're using,  can we try and see if it works here?  Is it sure?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think it's working.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Well, let's skip this for now.  And it's been added.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm going to take this and I will copy the link address.  We go over here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We scroll to seven.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Excellent.  All right.  Doctor, are there any other review sites that you wanted  to also be able to send review requests on?  So a review request is basically a request sent to a  patient to leave a review on either Google or Facebook or<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  CareDash.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So would you also want to be able to...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Do you have a Facebook page?  I have.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So it's just Google so far.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Nice.  So it's confirmed that your reviews are populating.  Basically, yes.  And here we go.  All right.  Excellent.  Your old reviews at least have populated in the application.  Excellent.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Do you...  Where is the scheduler?  Sorry, the scheduler?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So the reputation management platform doesn't have a  scheduler.  I think that what you're asking about is either like  online scheduling or digital check-in or those things.  My domain is mostly just reputation management.  For the rest of your product, I believe that either  someone from our premium services team will reach out<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  to you for those things.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Do you want me to set up a meeting for you and the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  premium services team?  They can assign a representative for the rest of your  novel health product?  Yes, that would be nice.  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I will make sure that I do that.  So the next step is I'm going to send out an email to<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm going to make a list of all the appointment reasons  that you have in your QMd application.  And I'm going to ask you in that email which of those  appointment reasons you want patients should receive a<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  review request for.  Would it be all of them?  Probably, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, all of the appointment reasons.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So the next few steps, doctor, because the client  facing, you being the client, the client facing  configuration has been done.  The next few steps are going to be a good deal of  back-end configuration because what we're doing is  this platform with your QMd so that when a patient is  checked out on the scheduler there, their information is  automatically uploaded here in the contacts module,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  which I believe might already be happening.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'll confirm on the status for this.  And when that happens, we can set up another automation.  We can set up another automation whereby patients  are automatically sent review requests just by<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  arriving in this application.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I am going to give you a quick look at the templates<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  that are used.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Basically, this is what the review request text is<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  going to look like.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  This is what patients are going to see.  The reason I pulled this up is because I wanted to ask  you if there's anything that you would want to change  over here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No, this is good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Nice, that's fine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we'll select Google over here so that the Google<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  link is created as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We'll unselect this for now.  Your experience wasn't great.  We want to make it right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.  Hold on one second, Nasti.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I just want to see the bottom of the page.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Can you see?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'll show you what it looks like.  It isn't entirely clear what it's going to look like.  Just give me one second while I set this up.  I'll show you exactly what it looks like.  So if the review request is sent via text message,  this is how it's going to appear.  Hi, contact first name.  Thank you for choosing Eva Galsian, Family Medicine NYC.  Please provide your feedback by clicking the link below.  Once they click the link, they will be sent onto this  page or this screen where they will see two links.  One is Review Us on Google.  And the second link is if your experience wasn't great,  contact us directly.  If they were to click on Review Us on Google,  let me show you what that would look like.  It's from your Gmail account.  That's fine.  But I can tell you what it would look like, the review page.  And if they click on Contact Us Directly, they will see this.  This is a mini form that they're going to fill out.  And when they click on Submit over here, this screen,  and then this feedback, it's sent directly to you as opposed  to appearing as a public review.  Right, so it's going to end up in your inbox.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Got it, perfect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Or it can also end up in your reviews module.  But it's going to be different.  The icon over here instead of this G for Google is going to,  it's hard for me to describe it, but the icon will be different  for direct feedback as opposed to public reviews.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And let me confirm a couple of other things as well.  So these are categories that will basically show you what you're going to see.  So these are categories that will basically show in third party listings.  Third party listings are basically any sites where your practice has any information about itself,  like the practice's name or the practice's address or something like that.  So you would find this information on sites like Apple Maps or Uber  or multiple other websites that display listings for medical practices.  We can ensure that the information being displayed on all of those listings is uniform and consistent.  But in order to do that, we need to complete the information that needs to be added  to your business profile and the reputation management platform.  So what, doctor, what would you say your primary category would be?  The primary category for your...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  What are the options?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We have nurse practitioner, primary care, dentist, primary dental care, podiatrist, primary podiatrist.  So medical...  Should we leave it general and then as an additional care, if I put in family medicine,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  so what's a bearing medicine?  I don't know where the sleep special is.  I don't know why that is as well, actually.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Maybe because this family doctor, family medicine, we can find something else.  Primary care clinic, general medicine doctor.  Family practice physician.  Is that something that...  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  All right. Excellent.  So that's one.  Okay. So some of these keywords are too long.  Oh, absolutely.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  I changed it.  Okay. Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm just going to remove some of the longer keywords here. <span style=""color:red""><b>  Allergy testing, skin testing, delete environmental allergies over here</b></span>.  Let's delete blood for food allergies.  I think we can remove the parentheses.  So keywords are supposed to be just that, short and very, very to the point.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Hold on one second.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So travel consultation is probably fairly misleading.  So we can just include...  No, we can keep the vaccinations and travel medications, but remove travel consultation.  We don't have to delete all of this. We can convert those into keywords.  So we just remove the parenthesis. Just give me one second.  Let's do this.  Let's delete if needed over here.  And we can delete vaccines as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can delete the and.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We've lost pre-exposure. This is fine.  We can.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think we can delete all of this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Unless we add treatments after.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  One second. Let's see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Would this be COVID testing or COVID treatment?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can do.  I don't think it's treatment.  We can remove.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Infections.  Asymptote treatment.  Dominal pain treatment.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can delete this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Work removal functional medicine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we can delete this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  There we go.  Okay.  Then a different keyword for a keyword.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we can delete this.  And great. I think that should do it.  That's safe.  Let's see if that fixes it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  So,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm assuming that the information that we put in here is correct.  And what I'm looking to do now is to push this information out to your Google My Business listing.  Do you not want me to update this on your Google?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I'm going to go to the website.  Okay.  This should be working.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So, what I'm going to do now is to make sure that the website works.  Under actions on the listing page, you get this option here that says force sync.  And that pushes the information in your system, this information, across all of these listings.  Wherever you have information present in any of these websites, it will make sure that that information is correct across all of these listings.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So, we'll return to this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Thank you so much, Dr. Wilson. You've been really, really helpful.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We've actually got a major chunk of the work out of the way.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Next steps are, we're going to create an interface between your reputation management platform and CureMD.  To set up the automation where patient information comes to this platform automatically when a patient is checked out in the CureMD application.  We're going to, we'll go ahead and test that.  And once that is complete, I'll get in touch with you.  And I can give you a brief training on all the modules that you see before you.  We can also completely set this up so that this is completely automatic from end to end.  Even if it can be replied to automatically from within the reputation management platform.  And we set that up, I can actually show you right now where we set that up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay, that sounds good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Alright, thank you so much.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Sorry, go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  You're welcome.  Please ask whoever is in charge for the first part to contact you.  Sure, I'll reach out to someone from Premium Services to speak to you about the online scheduling, I believe is what you're inquiring about.  I'll have someone reach out to you.  Perfect, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.  Thanks a lot for helping Doctor. Have a good day.  Have a good day.<br>","<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Hello, this is Dr. Goldstein.  Hi, Dr. Goldstein.  This is Hasim calling from QMZ.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm calling with, I'm doing very well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  How are you?  Good, thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So I wanted to speak to you just to give you  clarity on what's happening.  Your existing implementation specialist  for reputation management had to leave the organization  without giving prior notice because of a life event.  So I'm taking over your project, your reputation management<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  project here on out.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, so my question is, I've taken a look at your account.  It seems that it has been, at least the basic configurations<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  have been done.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I wanted to inquire exactly what you feel  is bending from our end and where in the time.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  And but before, once he's ready, next so he can,  I don't know, implement it, I don't know,  merge into the website.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, so that's specifically for online scheduling.  What I'm talking about is reputation management,  where you send, where patients are going to send you reviews  on Google, on like public websites,  where you send out review requests to the patients<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  and they send.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So that has little to do with the website.  So this is something that you would assist me in setting up.  So I just wanted to basically clarify.  I'm looking at your account right now. <span style=""color:red""><b>  And what we would need to do is to connect your Google My  Business, which is your Google Maps location to the reputation</b></span><br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  management platform.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And in order for us to be able to do that,  you would need to have your account's login credentials.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  And so these are the login credentials<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  for the Google account of your business.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So this is your Google Maps location.  So I have to reach out to the credentials.  But if I recall correctly, I have to give them permission.  I would have to go through some kind of steps of verification.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  With patient thought?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I would take a Google account, the Google Business account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We did Google Ads through them.  And they needed access to the actual account.  So I gave them, I think, managing rights,  something like that, as a manager.  So they could log in and get them.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Understood.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So if I have the password or if I  have a computer, I can log in and business account  without entering my name and password.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, if you can do that, I believe  if you sign out and then try clicking on Forgot Password,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  then you should get a password.  Oh, you're right.  Yeah.  OK.  Do you want to wait while I try doing it?  Or should I try to do it again?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Well, doctor, if you're with patients right now,  we can set up a call to do this another time.  But if you have time right now, we can do it right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No, I have time right now.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  No, I'm not going to.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.  So can we do an AnyDesk session?  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.  Could you share your address?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  726.  Just one second.  Loading on my end.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  7233.  261.  261.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Got it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  It's saying connection in progress on my end.  Mm-hmm.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I see it.  You think that's great?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Oh, it says that the session was closed by the remote user.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think you might have accidentally  hit Escape or something.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm reconnecting.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I can see your screen.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Have you received your user login credentials  for the reputation management?  For your reputation management account?  For my account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  For your account?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Yes, from us.  We should have sent this to you.  If you haven't, actually, let me quickly check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I see that you do have an account.  I'm going to send you a password reset email.  You should get this on eva.golsteyn at gmail.com.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.  And once you have that, I will let me just take.  I got it.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Now, the little settings cog in the top right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Oops.  Just knocking things over.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And then we go to Google.  And then we click on Connect.  And now, so here is where you would  click on Use Another Account and enter your location's  Google account credentials.  So to do that, if you could try resetting your password  for your location's Google account.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I'm sorry.  I didn't know what I needed to do.  I need to hop on.  OK.  I think I believe that's it.  I think I'm going to go back to the Google account.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I think I believe if you were to,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  let me take controls for a second.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I think if you click on the top right where this E is a  bearing, so you're logged into your personal email.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.  Yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Is your personal email also used for your Google My Business<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  email?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Are the two emails the same?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Let's click on Continue.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Go on Sign In.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  To be honest, it looks like your credentials are the same  for your GMB page and your...  Hold on.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Add a user or not?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Can we change the email on that?  So it's looking a lot like your...  I'm not entirely certain how this works,  but it's looking like you're either added as a user to your  GMB account or your personal email address is the same as  your location's Google account's email address,  is what I feel is happening.  I'm actually Googling right now.  Could you let me have the controls for a second?  Doctor, the current Gmail account that you're using,  can we try and see if it works here?  Is it sure?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think it's working.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Well, let's skip this for now.  And it's been added.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm going to take this and I will copy the link address.  We go over here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We scroll to seven.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Excellent.  All right.  Doctor, are there any other review sites that you wanted  to also be able to send review requests on?  So a review request is basically a request sent to a  patient to leave a review on either Google or Facebook or<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  CareDash.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So would you also want to be able to...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Do you have a Facebook page?  I have.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So it's just Google so far.  All right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Nice.  So it's confirmed that your reviews are populating.  Basically, yes.  And here we go.  All right.  Excellent.  Your old reviews at least have populated in the application.  Excellent.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Do you...  Where is the scheduler?  Sorry, the scheduler?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So the reputation management platform doesn't have a  scheduler.  I think that what you're asking about is either like  online scheduling or digital check-in or those things.  My domain is mostly just reputation management.  For the rest of your product, I believe that either  someone from our premium services team will reach out<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  to you for those things.  OK.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Do you want me to set up a meeting for you and the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  premium services team?  They can assign a representative for the rest of your  novel health product?  Yes, that would be nice.  Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I will make sure that I do that.  So the next step is I'm going to send out an email to<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm going to make a list of all the appointment reasons  that you have in your QMd application.  And I'm going to ask you in that email which of those  appointment reasons you want patients should receive a<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  review request for.  Would it be all of them?  Probably, yeah.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  OK, all of the appointment reasons.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So the next few steps, doctor, because the client  facing, you being the client, the client facing  configuration has been done.  The next few steps are going to be a good deal of  back-end configuration because what we're doing is  this platform with your QMd so that when a patient is  checked out on the scheduler there, their information is  automatically uploaded here in the contacts module,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  which I believe might already be happening.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'll confirm on the status for this.  And when that happens, we can set up another automation.  We can set up another automation whereby patients  are automatically sent review requests just by<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  arriving in this application.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I am going to give you a quick look at the templates<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  that are used.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Basically, this is what the review request text is<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  going to look like.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  This is what patients are going to see.  The reason I pulled this up is because I wanted to ask  you if there's anything that you would want to change  over here.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  No, this is good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Nice, that's fine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we'll select Google over here so that the Google<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  link is created as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We'll unselect this for now.  Your experience wasn't great.  We want to make it right.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  OK, great.  Hold on one second, Nasti.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I just want to see the bottom of the page.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Can you see?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'll show you what it looks like.  It isn't entirely clear what it's going to look like.  Just give me one second while I set this up.  I'll show you exactly what it looks like.  So if the review request is sent via text message,  this is how it's going to appear.  Hi, contact first name.  Thank you for choosing Eva Galsian, Family Medicine NYC.  Please provide your feedback by clicking the link below.  Once they click the link, they will be sent onto this  page or this screen where they will see two links.  One is Review Us on Google.  And the second link is if your experience wasn't great,  contact us directly.  If they were to click on Review Us on Google,  let me show you what that would look like.  It's from your Gmail account.  That's fine.  But I can tell you what it would look like, the review page.  And if they click on Contact Us Directly, they will see this.  This is a mini form that they're going to fill out.  And when they click on Submit over here, this screen,  and then this feedback, it's sent directly to you as opposed  to appearing as a public review.  Right, so it's going to end up in your inbox.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Got it, perfect.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Or it can also end up in your reviews module.  But it's going to be different.  The icon over here instead of this G for Google is going to,  it's hard for me to describe it, but the icon will be different  for direct feedback as opposed to public reviews.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And let me confirm a couple of other things as well.  So these are categories that will basically show you what you're going to see.  So these are categories that will basically show in third party listings. <span style=""color:red""><b>  Third party listings are basically any sites where your practice has any information about itself,  like the practice's name or the practice's address or something like that</b></span>.  So you would find this information on sites like Apple Maps or Uber  or multiple other websites that display listings for medical practices.  We can ensure that the information being displayed on all of those listings is uniform and consistent.  But in order to do that, we need to complete the information that needs to be added  to your business profile and the reputation management platform.  So what, doctor, what would you say your primary category would be?  The primary category for your...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  What are the options?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We have nurse practitioner, primary care, dentist, primary dental care, podiatrist, primary podiatrist.  So medical...  Should we leave it general and then as an additional care, if I put in family medicine,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  so what's a bearing medicine?  I don't know where the sleep special is.  I don't know why that is as well, actually.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Maybe because this family doctor, family medicine, we can find something else.  Primary care clinic, general medicine doctor.  Family practice physician.  Is that something that...  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  All right. Excellent.  So that's one.  Okay. So some of these keywords are too long.  Oh, absolutely.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  I changed it.  Okay. Great.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm just going to remove some of the longer keywords here.  Allergy testing, skin testing, delete environmental allergies over here.  Let's delete blood for food allergies.  I think we can remove the parentheses.  So keywords are supposed to be just that, short and very, very to the point.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Hold on one second.  Sure.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So travel consultation is probably fairly misleading.  So we can just include...  No, we can keep the vaccinations and travel medications, but remove travel consultation.  We don't have to delete all of this. We can convert those into keywords.  So we just remove the parenthesis. Just give me one second.  Let's do this.  Let's delete if needed over here.  And we can delete vaccines as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can delete the and.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  We've lost pre-exposure. This is fine.  We can.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I think we can delete all of this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Unless we add treatments after.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  One second. Let's see.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Would this be COVID testing or COVID treatment?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can do.  I don't think it's treatment.  We can remove.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Infections.  Asymptote treatment.  Dominal pain treatment.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We can delete this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Work removal functional medicine.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  And we can delete this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  There we go.

Let's see if that fixes it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay.  Okay.  So,<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  I'm assuming that the information that we put in here is correct.  And what I'm looking to do now is to push this information out to your Google My Business listing.  Do you not want me to update this on your Google?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  I'm going to go to the website.  Okay.  This should be working.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  So, what I'm going to do now is to make sure that the website works.  Under actions on the listing page, you get this option here that says force sync.  And that pushes the information in your system, this information, across all of these listings.  Wherever you have information present in any of these websites, it will make sure that that information is correct across all of these listings.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  So, we'll return to this.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Thank you so much, Dr. Wilson. You've been really, really helpful.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  We've actually got a major chunk of the work out of the way.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Next steps are, we're going to create an interface between your reputation management platform and CureMD.  To set up the automation where patient information comes to this platform automatically when a patient is checked out in the CureMD application.  We're going to, we'll go ahead and test that.  And once that is complete, I'll get in touch with you.  And I can give you a brief training on all the modules that you see before you.  We can also completely set this up so that this is completely automatic from end to end.  Even if it can be replied to automatically from within the reputation management platform.  And we set that up, I can actually show you right now where we set that up.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Okay, that sounds good.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  Alright, thank you so much.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Family Medicine NYC</span></b>:  Sorry, go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Haysam Wyne</span></b>:  You're welcome.  Please ask whoever is in charge for the first part to contact you.  Sure, I'll reach out to someone from Premium Services to speak to you about the online scheduling, I believe is what you're inquiring about.  I'll have someone reach out to you.  Perfect, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.  Thanks a lot for helping Doctor. Have a good day.  Have a good day.<br>",

But the next best I could  think of maybe to call you guys and request if you guys can maybe help him with his portal.  He was on the other line as well holding right now. So if you want, I can maybe give you  his first name, last name or anything you guys might think.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Digestive Disease Care</span></b>:  What's his date of birth?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ryan Keller</span></b>:  Yes, ma'am.

Okay, so the patient  was actually on the other line holding. Should I advise him or can I conference him maybe  if we can like just update him that we're going to message the office manager if you  think that's okay? Just because he was waiting for a bit. So I just wanted him to be on the<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Digestive Disease Care</span></b>:  same page.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ryan Keller</span></b>:  Oh, okay.

Currently the office manager is away for a bit as I  was told, but we're going to leave them a message. And I do speak with Sejal as well,  which is the office manager. So before...  Would you speak to him?  Yes, sir. Ms. Sherma, which is the office manager for the...  Ms. Sherma?  Yes, sir. <span style=""color:red""><b> So she's currently away, but the practice will leave a message and I'll personally  call her before the dance just so she can then reach out to you and reset your password</b></span>.

They got a call to help us, which is how I got to you. Now you're sending it back to  them. So that makes no sense to you.  Yes, sir.  Like a ping pong ball?  I do. I'm so sorry about that, sir.

That's what the other office said. So I'm going to leave a message first. She should  be giving him a call back, though.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ryan Keller</span></b>:  Okay. That sounds great. So Mr. Leonard, if you're still conference entered, Sejal should  be calling you back. But what I'll do is personally, since we spoke on Friday, I'll also reach  out to Sejal for my end, but I'll try my best to speak with her, have her maybe help you  with this. If not, I'll try getting consent so I can maybe do something. But I'll personally  make sure and not rest till you're logged in, sir.

They got a call to help us, which is how I got to you. Now you're sending it back to  them. So that makes no sense to you.  Yes, sir.  Like a ping pong ball?  I do. I'm so sorry about that, sir. Is there maybe a way, ma'am, if I can maybe get a number  for Sejal if that's okay? It's just funny to see if there's maybe still something I  can do to help Mr. Leonard.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Digestive Disease Care</span></b>:  I don't have her direct number, just an extension. I can call to see if she's available now.  But if not, I'm going to leave her a message to try and give him a call.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ryan Keller</span></b>:  Okay. Perfect. That sounds great. So Mr. Leonard...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Digestive Disease Care</span></b>:  Give me one second. Let me check.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ryan Keller</span></b>:  Sure, sure. Thank you, ma'am.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Digestive Disease Care</span></b>:  Hello? How is he going to...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ryan Keller</span></b>:  I'm so sorry, ma'am. Yes, there's just a lot of waiting music. Yes, ma'am.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Digestive Disease Care</span></b>:  I tried to reach out to her. I think she's speaking to one of the doctors right now.  That's what the other office said. So I'm going to leave a message first. She should  be giving him a call back, though.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ryan Keller</span></b>:  Okay. That sounds great. So Mr. Leonard, if you're still conference entered, Sejal should  be calling you back. But what I'll do is personally, since we spoke on Friday, I'll also reach  out to Sejal for my end, but I'll try my best to speak with her, have her maybe help you  with this. If not, I'll try getting consent so I can maybe do something. But I'll personally  make sure and not rest till you're logged in, sir. So if you can just cooperate a little  bit while Mr. Sharma reaches out to you, then we'll take it from there, by the way. Perfect.  Thank you for your time, ma'am, and I hope you have a beautiful rest of your day.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Digestive Disease Care</span></b>:  You too. Have a nice day.<br>",

Currently, the office manager is away for a bit, as I was told, but we're going to leave them a message.  And I do speak with Seju Aspo, which is the office manager. So before...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Client</span></b>:  Who do you speak to?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Ryan Keller</span></b>:  Yes, sir.

So why I'm actually trying to reach out to her as well is, it says, sir, I'm so sorry about the misconfusion.  The portal is something that the practice normally helps their patients with, but I've gotten a lot of calls like these, and it just makes me personally so sorry I feel bad because, you know, our patients do get sent back.  I'm just trying to speak with Seju. She can give me consent, maybe, to do this on, you know, her behalf and the practice behalf.

How can I help?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Hey good afternoon, Dr. Shah please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Yep sure Gary. Give me one second. <span style=""color:red""><b> I'm going to put you on hold and see if she's available</b></span>.  Thank you.  Okay.  Hi Gary.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Hey good afternoon, Dr. Shah. How are you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  I'm good and how are you doing?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  I'm good thank you. We're joining a call.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Yeah. Today Audrey sent the money back to Monica Power and means refunded the money  and then she paid like, you remember you told me that on her insurance there was a, on 3-15  that visit patient's responsibility is $63.25 and there was another visit which is GT where  there was a responsibility $33.69. <span style=""color:red""><b> So we didn't charge that but the $63 we charged it and took it out from there</b></span>.  Umm, $63. Okay.  So she refunded her around $336.75.  $336?  $336.75 refunded her.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Got it. She did call me as well. I was away so I have yet to call back.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  That's why I just want to touch bases with you. I was going through these things with, I don't know why she  keep on calling that much but I realized that Audrey did a little mistake on that.  She said that she paid copay three times.  Yes.  The question what I have is her insurance require copay or her insurance doesn't require copay. <span style=""color:red""><b>  She has not written anything on the insurance card</b></span>. So they took copay two times not three times.  She came three times but first one was the annual checkup and there was a preventive usually we don't take it.  Zero, zero and then I can tell you which two visit they took it $30, $30.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  $33 yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  No $30 and $33, $30. Two times they took $30 and $30.  I don't know why they took it. I don't know that her insurance require copay or not.  That's the one question I have to ask you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Okay, I will read the ERAs just now and I'll let you know.  And okay, so on the first visit that was an annual wellness visit.  There was no responsibility. The insurance paid $256 and then it was settled.  On the next visit the insurance created.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Telephone call.  Yeah, the telephone call.  $27.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  They created a responsibility of $33.69.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  We didn't charge that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Okay, now let me see if that is a copay or what amount was that.  So one moment please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  No, that was not copay. It is written patient's responsibility.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  It's co-insurance. It's actually co-insurance.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Okay, so that's one.  The one after that her visit was three, I would say $315.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  $315 yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  They paid $165, $0, something and that time they took $30.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  That time they actually made a responsibility of $63.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Oh, when? On $15?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  On $315, yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Oh, okay. I didn't see that.  And then $415 they took another $30.  $414.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  It appears that there is no responsibility on $414.  So altogether they made a responsibility of that $63 and that $33.  So around $96, $97.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Yeah, so my question is, yeah, go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  I'm actually looking at if there is any other kind of responsibility.  Okay, yeah, so no responsibility as per the ERA.  So now the patient said something and maybe there could be a dispute on that.  That you guys took $400 from her card, which you said that you would return back.  And that $96 responsibility that she has, she told me that she paid around $30 co-pay every time she visited your office.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  She didn't pay every time she visited.  She paid two times.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  How much was that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  $30, $30.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Alright, $30 and $30.  So it's all together then $460 then?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Let me see.  Yeah, I think that's what it is.  $460 she paid.  Yes, she paid $460.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Okay, so out of that, we take out, first we take out $33.69 and then we take out $63.25.  And then she should have been refunded with $363.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  $363, okay, alright.  I think Audrey refunded $336 instead of $363.  So we will refund the rest of the money.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Okay, can you, if that is possible, can you do it now before I call her?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  $363.  How much you want me to refund again?  $26.31.  $26.31.  Okay, I have to see if Audrey is not here. If I can do it on a square or not, I have to check it out.  But maybe I can call Audrey once she's done with the class and then we can refund that.  By tonight we can do it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Okay, so can I call her tomorrow then?  Because, you know, she might say, you know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  I know, that's not a problem.  That's not the problem.  I just wanted to get done with her because she keeps on calling and screaming at the people who are working at the desk who have no idea.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  No screaming is bad.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Yeah, no, she is just like really.  And she didn't work until we took that $200 out.  She didn't work on her insurance.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Exactly, yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  She calls so many times about that insurance not being and she never paid any attention.  Never called her back.  She never called us back even acknowledging that we called. <span style=""color:red""><b>  So many emails, never acknowledged that unless we took that $200 out and then she started calling</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Right, right.  Yeah, that's what patients do.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Yeah, I mean the whole thing is, it's just so very bad things.  You know, I don't like people do.  And they expect that you go to the physician and they treat you well.  You depend upon your whole health on that, right?  How do you do that?  I will let it go for $20, $26, whatever, $30.  Who cares?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Exactly.  Yeah, but you know, it's just everybody has a different...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  But anyway, yes.  So I will have Audrey, as soon as Audrey returns that money, I will give you a call that she returned that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Got it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  And then she should not be calling our office anymore.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Sure.  And if I'm not available, you can leave a message with one of my team members that the refund has been made for Monica.  And I will then proceed with calling Monica.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  The other thing is, I think she asked for that, when we charge the money through the square, they take some whatever percentage they take, 3% or something, and she wants that money back too.  So I don't know how to kind of, what to do about that.  She wants like $208, not $200.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  That's not gonna happen, you know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  That's what I'm saying.  I'm not taking that money in my pocket, and I do not want to pay from my pocket.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Exactly.  No, I'll explain her that this is a payment gateway, and they charge that money.  There's nothing that you're getting.  So there is some sort of cost and all that, that she has to bear as well.  Yeah, and there is a cost of secretarial charge.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  All these secretaries are screaming charge.  You're spending so much of time, your team is spending so much time.  I mean, where is it coming from?  And this particular person, I mean, they are all young girls.  I really don't know.  They're not realizing that healthcare is different in this country than where they grew up.  It's not the same.  It's different here.  They think they have an incident, so everything is, yeah, they flipped that card and it's done.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Yeah, that's not how US healthcare is, you know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  That's what I'm saying, yeah.  So this is what I do.  I will return her $26.31, and as soon as I do, I'll call you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>: <span style=""color:red""><b>  Sure, doctor, and I'll explain her about the square payments as well</b></span>.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Okay, thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  All right, thank you so much, doctor.

You're spending so much of time, your team is spending so much time.  I mean, where is it coming from?  And this particular person, I mean, they are all young girls.  I really don't know.  They're not realizing that healthcare is different in this country than where they grew up.  It's not the same.  It's different here.  They think they have an incident, so everything is, yeah, they flipped that card and it's done.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Yeah, that's not how US healthcare is, you know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  That's what I'm saying, yeah.  So this is what I do.  I will return her $26.31, and as soon as I do, I'll call you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Sure, doctor, and I'll explain her about the square payments as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Okay, thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  All right, thank you so much, doctor.  We have a good day.  Take care.  Bye.<br>","<b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Hi this is Shruti from Dr. Shah and Dr. Chaudhuri's office. How can I help?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Hey good afternoon, Dr. Shah please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Yep sure Gary. Give me one second. I'm going to put you on hold and see if she's available.  Thank you.  Okay.  Hi Gary.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Hey good afternoon, Dr. Shah. How are you?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  I'm good and how are you doing?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  I'm good thank you. We're joining a call.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Yeah. Today Audrey sent the money back to Monica Power and means refunded the money  and then she paid like, you remember you told me that on her insurance there was a, on 3-15  that visit patient's responsibility is $63.25 and there was another visit which is GT where  there was a responsibility $33.69. So we didn't charge that but the $63 we charged it and took it out from there.  Umm, $63. Okay.  So she refunded her around $336.75.  $336?  $336.75 refunded her.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Got it. She did call me as well. I was away so I have yet to call back.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  That's why I just want to touch bases with you. I was going through these things with, I don't know why she  keep on calling that much but I realized that Audrey did a little mistake on that.  She said that she paid copay three times.  Yes.  The question what I have is her insurance require copay or her insurance doesn't require copay.  She has not written anything on the insurance card. So they took copay two times not three times.  She came three times but first one was the annual checkup and there was a preventive usually we don't take it.  Zero, zero and then I can tell you which two visit they took it $30, $30.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  $33 yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  No $30 and $33, $30. Two times they took $30 and $30.  I don't know why they took it. I don't know that her insurance require copay or not.  That's the one question I have to ask you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Okay, I will read the ERAs just now and I'll let you know.  And okay, so on the first visit that was an annual wellness visit.  There was no responsibility. The insurance paid $256 and then it was settled.  On the next visit the insurance created.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Telephone call.  Yeah, the telephone call.  $27.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  They created a responsibility of $33.69.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  We didn't charge that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Okay, now let me see if that is a copay or what amount was that.  So one moment please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  No, that was not copay. It is written patient's responsibility.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  It's co-insurance. It's actually co-insurance.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Okay, so that's one.  The one after that her visit was three, I would say $315.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  $315 yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  They paid $165, $0, something and that time they took $30.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  That time they actually made a responsibility of $63.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Oh, when? On $15?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  On $315, yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Oh, okay. I didn't see that.  And then $415 they took another $30.  $414.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  It appears that there is no responsibility on $414.  So altogether they made a responsibility of that $63 and that $33.  So around $96, $97.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Yeah, so my question is, yeah, go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  I'm actually looking at if there is any other kind of responsibility.  Okay, yeah, so no responsibility as per the ERA.  So now the patient said something and maybe there could be a dispute on that.  That you guys took $400 from her card, which you said that you would return back.  And that $96 responsibility that she has, she told me that she paid around $30 co-pay every time she visited your office.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  She didn't pay every time she visited.  She paid two times.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  How much was that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  $30, $30.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Alright, $30 and $30.  So it's all together then $460 then?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Let me see.  Yeah, I think that's what it is.  $460 she paid.  Yes, she paid $460.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Okay, so out of that, we take out, first we take out $33.69 and then we take out $63.25.  And then she should have been refunded with $363.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  $363, okay, alright.  I think Audrey refunded $336 instead of $363.  So we will refund the rest of the money.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Okay, can you, if that is possible, can you do it now before I call her?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  $363.  How much you want me to refund again?  $26.31.  $26.31.  Okay, I have to see if Audrey is not here. If I can do it on a square or not, I have to check it out.  But maybe I can call Audrey once she's done with the class and then we can refund that.  By tonight we can do it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Okay, so can I call her tomorrow then?  Because, you know, she might say, you know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  I know, that's not a problem.  That's not the problem.  I just wanted to get done with her because she keeps on calling and screaming at the people who are working at the desk who have no idea.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  No screaming is bad.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Yeah, no, she is just like really.  And she didn't work until we took that $200 out.  She didn't work on her insurance.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Exactly, yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  She calls so many times about that insurance not being and she never paid any attention.  Never called her back.  She never called us back even acknowledging that we called.  So many emails, never acknowledged that unless we took that $200 out and then she started calling.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Right, right.  Yeah, that's what patients do.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Yeah, I mean the whole thing is, it's just so very bad things.  You know, I don't like people do.  And they expect that you go to the physician and they treat you well.  You depend upon your whole health on that, right?  How do you do that?  I will let it go for $20, $26, whatever, $30.  Who cares?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Exactly.  Yeah, but you know, it's just everybody has a different...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  But anyway, yes.  So I will have Audrey, as soon as Audrey returns that money, I will give you a call that she returned that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Got it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  And then she should not be calling our office anymore.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Sure.  And if I'm not available, you can leave a message with one of my team members that the refund has been made for Monica.  And I will then proceed with calling Monica.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  The other thing is, I think she asked for that, when we charge the money through the square, they take some whatever percentage they take, 3% or something, and she wants that money back too.  So I don't know how to kind of, what to do about that.  She wants like $208, not $200.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  That's not gonna happen, you know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  That's what I'm saying.  I'm not taking that money in my pocket, and I do not want to pay from my pocket.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Exactly.  No, I'll explain her that this is a payment gateway, and they charge that money.  There's nothing that you're getting.  So there is some sort of cost and all that, that she has to bear as well.

The question what I have is her insurance require copay or her insurance doesn't require copay. <span style=""color:red""><b>  She has not written anything on the insurance card</b></span>. So they took copay two times not three times.  She came three times but first one was the annual checkup and there was a preventive usually we don't take it.  Zero, zero and then I can tell you which two visit they took it $30, $30.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  $33 yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  No $30 and $33, $30. Two times they took $30 and $30.  I don't know why they took it. I don't know that her insurance require copay or not.  That's the one question I have to ask you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Okay, I will read the ERAs just now and I'll let you know.  And okay, so on the first visit that was an annual wellness visit.  There was no responsibility. The insurance paid $256 and then it was settled.  On the next visit the insurance created.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Telephone call.  Yeah, the telephone call.  $27.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  They created a responsibility of $33.69.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  We didn't charge that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Okay, now let me see if that is a copay or what amount was that.  So one moment please.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  No, that was not copay. It is written patient's responsibility.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  It's co-insurance. It's actually co-insurance.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Okay, so that's one.  The one after that her visit was three, I would say $315.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  $315 yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  They paid $165, $0, something and that time they took $30.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  That time they actually made a responsibility of $63.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Oh, when? On $15?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  On $315, yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Oh, okay. I didn't see that.  And then $415 they took another $30.  $414.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  It appears that there is no responsibility on $414.  So altogether they made a responsibility of that $63 and that $33.  So around $96, $97.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Yeah, so my question is, yeah, go ahead.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  I'm actually looking at if there is any other kind of responsibility.  Okay, yeah, so no responsibility as per the ERA.  So now the patient said something and maybe there could be a dispute on that.  That you guys took $400 from her card, which you said that you would return back.  And that $96 responsibility that she has, she told me that she paid around $30 co-pay every time she visited your office.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  She didn't pay every time she visited.  She paid two times.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  How much was that?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  $30, $30.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Alright, $30 and $30.  So it's all together then $460 then?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Let me see.  Yeah, I think that's what it is.  $460 she paid.  Yes, she paid $460.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Okay, so out of that, we take out, first we take out $33.69 and then we take out $63.25.  And then she should have been refunded with $363.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  $363, okay, alright.  I think Audrey refunded $336 instead of $363.  So we will refund the rest of the money.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Okay, can you, if that is possible, can you do it now before I call her?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  $363.  How much you want me to refund again?  $26.31.  $26.31.  Okay, I have to see if Audrey is not here. If I can do it on a square or not, I have to check it out.  But maybe I can call Audrey once she's done with the class and then we can refund that.  By tonight we can do it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Okay, so can I call her tomorrow then?  Because, you know, she might say, you know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  I know, that's not a problem.  That's not the problem.  I just wanted to get done with her because she keeps on calling and screaming at the people who are working at the desk who have no idea.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  No screaming is bad.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Yeah, no, she is just like really.  And she didn't work until we took that $200 out.  She didn't work on her insurance.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Exactly, yes.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  She calls so many times about that insurance not being and she never paid any attention.  Never called her back.  She never called us back even acknowledging that we called.  So many emails, never acknowledged that unless we took that $200 out and then she started calling.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Right, right.  Yeah, that's what patients do.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Yeah, I mean the whole thing is, it's just so very bad things.  You know, I don't like people do.  And they expect that you go to the physician and they treat you well.  You depend upon your whole health on that, right?  How do you do that?  I will let it go for $20, $26, whatever, $30.  Who cares?<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Exactly.  Yeah, but you know, it's just everybody has a different...<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  But anyway, yes.  So I will have Audrey, as soon as Audrey returns that money, I will give you a call that she returned that.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Got it.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  And then she should not be calling our office anymore.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Sure.  And if I'm not available, you can leave a message with one of my team members that the refund has been made for Monica.  And I will then proceed with calling Monica.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  The other thing is, I think she asked for that, when we charge the money through the square, they take some whatever percentage they take, 3% or something, and she wants that money back too.  So I don't know how to kind of, what to do about that.  She wants like $208, not $200.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  That's not gonna happen, you know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  That's what I'm saying.  I'm not taking that money in my pocket, and I do not want to pay from my pocket.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Exactly.  No, I'll explain her that this is a payment gateway, and they charge that money.  There's nothing that you're getting.  So there is some sort of cost and all that, that she has to bear as well.  Yeah, and there is a cost of secretarial charge.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  All these secretaries are screaming charge.  You're spending so much of time, your team is spending so much time.  I mean, where is it coming from?  And this particular person, I mean, they are all young girls.  I really don't know.  They're not realizing that healthcare is different in this country than where they grew up.  It's not the same.  It's different here.  They think they have an incident, so everything is, yeah, they flipped that card and it's done.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Yeah, that's not how US healthcare is, you know.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  That's what I'm saying, yeah.  So this is what I do.  I will return her $26.31, and as soon as I do, I'll call you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  Sure, doctor, and I'll explain her about the square payments as well.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Anjan Chaudhury, MD</span></b>:  Okay, thank you.<br><b><span style=""font-size: larger;"">Gary Gatland</span></b>:  All right, thank you so much, doctor.  We have a good day.  Take care.  Bye.<br>",,,
